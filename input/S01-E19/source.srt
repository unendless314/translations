1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,435
As we go deeper into contact work

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,605
it becomes much more than 
just about contacting ETs,

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,819
it really has a lot to do with the 
evolution of consciousness

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,405
and the evolution of your planet.

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,073
We cannot separate the two.

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:38,037
The process that consciousness 
takes from the experience of

7
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:42,792
separation to the experience of
reintegration.

8
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,088
Coincidentally it's the same process

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,800
that happens during the 
contact experience -

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,386
simply...

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,723
When you live a human life,

12
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,102
your life seems continuous and solid,

13
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,940
but if you start meditating or
you start spiritual practices,

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,944
you'll start to notice that the quality 
of reality changes,

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,781
your consciousness expands,

16
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,700
and you begin to travel to  
another realm

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,036
in your conciousness.

18
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,439
Ever wonder if there's intelligent

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,857
life elsewhere in the universe?

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,736
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

21
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,072
My name is Reuben Langdon.

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,451
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,580
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,082
Coincidentally, I was working on

25
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,334
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,671
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,632
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

28
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,343
...are they here with us?

29
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,851
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

30
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,686
...what is their purpose?

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,397
Why don't they make themselves more known?

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,607
Why the secrecy?

33
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,860
I've asked these questions to many experts,

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,529
yet each seems to have a different theory.

35
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,990
So I thought to myself,

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,576
why not ask the aliens directly?

37
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,619
So that's what I set out to do!

38
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,996
Well, sort of...

39
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,334
>> All right.

40
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,126
Hello to you,

41
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,127
this is Sasha.

42
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,462
>> Hi Sasha.

43
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,755
>> Nice to see you today.

44
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,589
>> Nice to see you.

45
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,552
Thanks for being here and being
part of this big adventure

46
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,221
show that I've got going on.

47
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,973
>> It is our pleasure.

48
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,559
>>First, I'd like to sort of
ask...

49
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,063
...what density do you reside in?

50
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,941
>> We are within what you
would call the higher levels

51
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,817
of fourth density.

52
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,401
>> Oh.

53
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,986
>> So we still have
physical bodies.

54
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,903
>> OK.

55
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:44,450
>> But we know that our planet
and our people is making--

56
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,160
on our way to making
the transition

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,121
to no longer having bodies.

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,915
>> So-- so almost--

59
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,835
well, fifth-- my understanding--
and I could be wrong--

60
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,961
but fifth--

61
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,881
fifth, sixth density would be
more losing the body sense.

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,758
But on the fourth
density as well?

63
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,429
>> In the scale that we use,
which is seven densities--

64
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,722
>> Right.

65
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,809
>> --the fourth density is
the last density in which

66
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,061
physicality is expressed
as a separate body.

67
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:12,854
>> OK.

68
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,566
>> As you begin moving
into fifth density,

69
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,610
then you become more
plasmic in nature.

70
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,611
>> I see.

71
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,739
>> So you could kind
of say light beings.

72
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,573
>> OK.

73
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,199
>> But as you go
farther and farther,

74
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,118
deeper and deeper
into fifth density,

75
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,455
then it becomes less
individualized and you start

76
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,874
moving more toward collective.

77
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:38,755
>> Would-- are dream states
be a fifth density reality?

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,341
What density would you
classify the dreams in?

79
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:48,181
>> Well, this is a metaphor
that we've used in the past

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,348
for another project.

81
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,393
We're going to resurrect it
here because it's very useful.

82
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,728
>> Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:59,525
>> If you consider the idea of
a golden lake to be your state

84
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,112
of oneness in
complete integration,

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:10,661
the state of sleep is the time
when, in a sense, you revisit,

86
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,040
or reconnect, with
that state of oneness.

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,377
So we wouldn't say that it is
necessarily a separate density.

88
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,380
The dream state is another
expression of consciousness

89
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,592
as you are reconnecting
with your true nature.

90
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,510
>> I see.

91
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,387
So it's not even--

92
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,180
it's almost in its
own classification.

93
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,972
>> Exactly.

94
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,850
>> Sort of like angelic realms.

95
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,438
Well, angelic realms I've
heard are borderline somewhere

96
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,356
around seventh--

97
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,275
sixth, seventh, eighth
density sort of thing.

98
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,569
But is that-- do they
have a classification?

99
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,321
>> Well, based on
what you're saying,

100
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,989
it seems we're using
different scales.

101
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,782
>> I see.

102
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,116
Yes.
OK.

103
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,660
>> So obviously, the answers
are going to be a little bit

104
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,452
confusing.

105
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,621
For us, it's a
seven density scale.

106
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,455
>> OK.

107
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:58,751
>> So we consider the angelic
realm to be more sixth density.

108
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
>> OK.

109
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,753
All right.

110
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,505
This is good because
I-- you know,

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,259
having, again, this scale
or base to ask questions

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,052
from and sort of
go back and forth,

113
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,223
it helps the audience sort of
put the pieces of the puzzle

114
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,891
together, formulate
their own ideas.

115
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,184
>> Yes.
>> Because a lot of the same--

116
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,727
sometimes, we use
same terminologies,

117
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,981
but, like we just noticed,
that it might be just slightly

118
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,940
a little bit different.

119
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,732
>> Yes.

120
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,235
If we will-- if we can say
just a little bit more about

121
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,320
density, just to give
a broader perspective--

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,113
>> Yes.

123
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,865
>> --for those
who are listening.

124
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,368
The best way to describe our
version of the communications

125
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,997
about density is to liken
it to the idea of a rainbow.

126
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,125
So when you have the
original white light that

127
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,378
then passes through a prism
and becomes a rainbow,

128
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:47,550
those seven light
frequencies that you see

129
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,678
are kind of representative
of the idea of the densities

130
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,929
of consciousness.

131
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,098
But if you look at
them very closely,

132
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,183
a rainbow for instance--

133
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,017
>> Yes.

134
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,394
>> --there's not a sharp
division between each one.

135
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,812
>> Right.
>> There's a gradation.

136
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,605
>> Correct, yeah.

137
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,317
>> So consciousness, thus,
moves from its original state

138
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,655
of oneness through the
fragmentation and through

139
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,950
series of different
types of expression.

140
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,622
The densest being
third density, which

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,918
is where humanity is leaving
from, because it's egoic based.

142
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,044
>> OK.

143
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:27,381
>> And then, you begin moving
out of that ego-based reality

144
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,926
and back into the collective.

145
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,053
>> I've also--
wonderful analogy.

146
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,222
I've also-- most
of the analogies

147
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,183
I've heard it's sort of
related to the chakra system,

148
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,102
which, again, is
related to the rainbow.

149
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:40,895
So it's--

150
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,771
>> Yes, exactly.

151
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,147
>> It sort of goes full circle.

152
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,607
>> Exactly.

153
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,319
>> So, you know, I've heard that
our plant and animal kingdom

154
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,696
are second density
consciousness.

155
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,782
>> Yes.

156
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:57,703
As we are moving
into fourth density,

157
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,414
and we're sort of in that
blending of the rainbow phase,

158
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:04,794
I would say early phase,
where are our animals--

159
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,589
are they blending into
the third density?

160
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,632
>> Ah.

161
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,466
OK.

162
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,469
There are two ways
to look at this idea.

163
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,223
One is a linear way and
one is a holographic way.

164
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,057
>> OK.

165
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,849
>> OK.

166
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:23,479
So if you are to look at it from
the perspective of linearity,

167
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,523
which is what humans
are more familiar with--

168
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,357
>> Yes.

169
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,860
>> --then what you would see
is that the other species

170
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,864
and the other consciousness
around you is moving also.

171
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,076
So from the linear
perspective, you're

172
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,538
going to find that the
species on your world

173
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,665
that you might consider
the higher second density

174
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:48,087
species, such as the primates,
and certain bird species, et

175
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:53,092
cetera, they are, too,
making a transition

176
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,555
to third density, which means,
then, the development of ego.

177
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:02,852
So you're starting to see even
in dogs and certain animals

178
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,479
more symptoms of ego.

179
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,816
Ego, of course, not
meaning a negative thing.

180
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,403
Ego is simply a mechanism
that grounds you

181
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
in the experience of separation
for a higher purpose.

182
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,907
>> Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,700
>> OK.

184
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,288
So in that sense, then,
that's the linear--

185
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,122
>> Right.

186
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,290
>> --perspective.

187
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,169
Now, if you were to look at
the holographic principle

188
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,504
of this idea, we're
going-- again,

189
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,922
we have to speak in metaphors.

190
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,757
>> Yes.

191
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:40,348
>> We're going to ask you to
imagine seven rooms that nest

192
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,559
inside each other like boxes--

193
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,769
like those Japanese boxes.

194
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,102
Yes?

195
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:45,936
>> OK.

196
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,979
Right.

197
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,484
>> And the bigger box that
contains the smaller boxes

198
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,278
would be more representative
of seventh density.

199
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,112
>> OK.

200
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:55,905
>> OK.

201
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,366
So from the holographic
perspective,

202
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:04,163
you exist in all of those boxes,
thus in all of the densities.

203
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:09,085
And it's simply a
matter of perspective

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,589
about the you that is choosing
to notice the experience it's

205
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,174
having at any given time.

206
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,551
But it is all simultaneous.

207
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,012
So in that sense, there's
no movement, linearly--

208
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,805
>> Right.

209
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,431
>> --from one
density to another.

210
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,351
It's a complete expression,
a complete experience

211
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,269
on all levels, simultaneously.

212
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,062
>> Right.

213
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:34,026
I saw-- would that relate to
platonic solids or geometrical

214
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
shapes--

215
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
>> Exactly, yes.

216
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,696
>> --as well?

217
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,864
There's a great video
I just saw online--

218
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,159
maybe I'll post it,
here, in this video--

219
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,287
where all of these platonic
solids were inside each other.

220
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,080
>> Exactly.

221
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,623
>> And they sort
of pull them apart.

222
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,457
>> Exactly.

223
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,127
The platonic solids are
a wonderful metaphor

224
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,797
for the density energy
and also for the evolution

225
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,259
of consciousness as it
moves from separation

226
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,177
back into integration.

227
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,930
There is one workshop
we do where we actually

228
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,267
equate each of the densities
to different platonic solids.

229
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,059
>> Oh, perfect.

230
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,685
OK.

231
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,811
>> It's the same idea, yes.

232
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,146
>> Oh, excellent.

233
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:17,361
And would that mean,
then, our first density

234
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:22,116
minerals and, you know,
rocks and these sorts of--

235
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,786
is water, I guess, consider
a first density being?

236
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,829
>> Yes.

237
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,621
Yes.

238
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,000
>> Would-- would that sort of
move into the second density,

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,213
then, and start having
sentient consciousness?

240
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,175
>> Well, the thing about
first density-- again, we're--

241
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,677
we're challenged by
the two perspectives,

242
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,636
linear and holographic.

243
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,889
>> Right, I guess what I'm
saying is in a linear sense.

244
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,598
>> In a linear sense.

245
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,390
>> Yeah.

246
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,226
>> In a linear sense, we have
to say that the first density,

247
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,978
consciousness, is a
little bit different.

248
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,770
>> OK.

249
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,064
>> Because the first
density consciousness,

250
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:59,570
being the first manifestation
into the reality of separation,

251
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,697
is the building
blocks of creation.

252
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,991
So it's your periodic
table of the elements.

253
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,867
>> Mm-hmm.

254
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,286
>> It's all those--
that stuff of creation.

255
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,078
>> Right.

256
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,999
>> Now, the higher forms, then,
like high first density would

257
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,667
be the mineral
kingdom, as an example.

258
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,376
>> Oh, I see.

259
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,002
OK.

260
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:15,336
>> And--

261
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,086
>> Oh, OK, OK.

262
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,087
So--
>> Yes.

263
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,382
>> So just like with our--

264
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,219
for, like, you guys
being on a higher

265
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,430
end of the fourth
density spectrum--

266
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,142
so you still have
physical bodies like us.

267
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,770
The craft that you
probably fly around in--

268
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,898
and where we're just
now entering that phase,

269
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,150
but we're still in that
fourth density classification.

270
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,609
OK.

271
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,652
>> So it's a spectrum.

272
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,027
>> Right.

273
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,195
>> It's an entire spectrum.

274
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,822
But the difference
you're gonna see--

275
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,159
because you humans are now
entering the fourth density

276
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,952
beginnings.

277
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,744
>> Right.

278
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,162
>> And we're toward the end.

279
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,082
The biggest difference
you're going

280
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:58,128
to see between the two of us is
what we call the egoic anchor.

281
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,004
>> OK.

282
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,133
>> So ours is not as
heavy, so to speak.

283
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:08,639
>> From your time of evolution,
if you can remember this

284
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,686
or have records of this
in your era, what was,

285
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,437
in relative years--

286
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,524
earth years, your
linear evolution

287
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:24,029
from beginnings of fourth
density to where you are now?

288
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,615
>> Well, the-- our--

289
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:31,328
looking at it linearly, we
went through very similar type

290
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,957
of evolution that you are
going through now, however,

291
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,460
we would say that our
challenges, as a species,

292
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,462
were different than yours.

293
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,008
So for us, a lot
of our challenges

294
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:52,349
had to do with
self-forgiveness, guilt, things

295
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,562
that we were holding on
to as a young species

296
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,566
that we then had to
learn how to transcend.

297
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,736
And for a very, very
long period of time,

298
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:09,658
those challenges for my species
really stopped our evolution

299
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,952
and almost destroyed
us as a species

300
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,287
because when you keep putting--

301
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,874
pushing down the
emotional things that

302
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,126
need to be explored, you can--

303
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,629
well, our species created
a plague, so to speak.

304
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,504
>> A plague, oh, wow.

305
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,964
>> Plague, yes.

306
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,719
Similar to what you might
call an immune plague where

307
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:33,641
a disease within our immune
systems was destroying us

308
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,977
and we had no idea what it was.

309
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,273
And we had to use
our connections

310
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
with, you might call
them the angels,

311
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,029
or the guardians of our species,
the guides of our species--

312
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,741
we had to connect with them
to find out what it was.

313
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:56,705
And what we found out was that
our pattern, as a species,

314
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,293
was that we were refusing
to look at and integrate

315
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
what you call the shadow.

316
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,712
>> OK.
Oh, I see.

317
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,215
>> So we were keeping
that separation.

318
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,259
And once we could
learn to integrate

319
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,303
the shadow and the
light within us,

320
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,389
this was a significant
nexus point

321
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,265
in our fourth
density evolution--

322
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,851
third fourth density evolution.

323
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,521
Once we were able to
make that integration,

324
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,108
then the plague healed
itself and our consciousness

325
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,442
began evolving.

326
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,402
>> Into fourth density.

327
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,486
>> Yes.

328
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,905
>> And was that a long time ago?

329
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,825
Or time wise, in a
linear sense, are you

330
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,118
able to put a time stamp on it?

331
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,412
>> Oh, it's very difficult
because, as you know,

332
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,746
timelines don't line up.

333
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,539
>> Sure.

334
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,585
>> But it was long enough ago--

335
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,255
if we were to pinpoint
a time on your world,

336
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:54,054
it would have been before
late, late dinosaur time.

337
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,847
>> OK.

338
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,182
So we're talking
thousands of years.

339
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:57,975
>> Millions.

340
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,851
>> Millions of years.

341
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,394
>> Yes.

342
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,814
>> In fourth density, right
now, since that evolution to it.

343
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,524
>> Again, the timelines
don't line up.

344
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,483
>> OK.

345
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,317
Right.

346
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,110
Yeah, I understand.

347
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,864
>> It's very-- it's really
impossible to answer.

348
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,782
The evolution--
generally speaking,

349
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,244
the evolution of
a physical species

350
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,038
does take a very,
very long time.

351
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,623
Now, it depends on the species.

352
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,292
It depends on the
genetic work that's

353
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,460
been done on the species.

354
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,378
It depends on what they're
holding on to, what

355
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
they're willing to let go of.

356
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,965
So everyone's
process is different.

357
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,883
>> Right.

358
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,386
Through these interactions,
I've learned that we all

359
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,055
create our own realities.

360
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,767
Is it possible for an
individual to go into a timeline

361
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,229
where the collective
evolution of the species

362
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:49,485
is accelerated, if the
individual is willing to do

363
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,569
that work, so to say.

364
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,406
And then-- and not
bypass the collective,

365
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,784
but go into a timeline where
that collective evolution

366
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,701
is super fast?

367
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,789
>> Well, that's really the
only way to change timelines.

368
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,125
It's not-- as you said, it's
not a matter of bypassing,

369
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,127
it's more a matter of resonance.

370
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:07,920
>> Right, OK.

371
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,090
>> So we've given--

372
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,759
we believe you've
heard it on tape,

373
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,970
we've given a little bit of what
we call the quantum map, which

374
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,933
talks about how the reality
stream or the time stream

375
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,144
is very similar to like
the blinking of eyes.

376
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,396
You don't notice your
eyes are blinking all day.

377
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,189
>> Right.

378
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,816
>> But that is
how the physical--

379
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,778
the physical universe continues
to express itself is through

380
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,488
bursts.

381
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,408
And each time-- it's like an
in breath and an out breath.

382
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,702
So each time there is
an in breath, which

383
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,080
is like the blinking
of an eye, you

384
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,583
realign with a new
frequency structure.

385
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,751
And that's how time--

386
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,337
that's how you, in a
sense, jump timelines.

387
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:56,218
We do have to say, though, that
the ego cannot direct this

388
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,010
at all.

389
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,719
>> Right.

390
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,512
>> So.

391
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,473
>> So, so it's a release of
the ego in order to do that.

392
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,266
>> Exactly.

393
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,100
>> Right.

394
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,771
So it's not-- and,
consciously, there's almost--

395
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,607
it's almost-- you can't--
almost can't do it consciously

396
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,400
because of--

397
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,317
>> Exactly.

398
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,154
>> --the ego is part of
this conscious mental mind--

399
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:16,947
>> Exactly.

400
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,240
>> --where we have-- where
we're trying to guide,

401
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,908
where we're trying
to steer the ship.

402
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,742
>> Exactly.

403
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,703
>> And you have to sort of let
go of the steering wheel to get

404
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,704
there.
>> Exactly.

405
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,165
The ego has-- it has
very significant needs.

406
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:27,958
>> Right.

407
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,086
>> And it will always, let's
say, default to those needs--

408
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,879
>> Right.

409
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,506
>> --before it will default to
the evolution of consciousness.

410
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
>> Right.

411
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,134
>> Because then it
dies, so to speak.

412
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:37,509
Yes.

413
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,012
>> It's almost like going to
the mountain and doing the hard

414
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,846
training.

415
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,182
And, then, you know, after
all the hard training,

416
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:48,437
you realize that, you know, to
get to this enlightened state,

417
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,897
there's no training necessary.

418
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,273
>> Exactly, my dear.

419
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,858
Exactly.

420
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,610
>> Excellent.

421
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,779
So it-- I kind of
want to go back

422
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,407
to the Pleiades and
your star system now.

423
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,078
We have this definition
of the Pleiades--

424
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,871
>> Yes.

425
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,582
>> --of, you know, the--
is it the Six Sisters?

426
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,374
Seven Sisters?

427
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,292
>> Seven Sisters, yes.

428
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,627
>> Seven Sisters.

429
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,378
And there's obviously--
because if you

430
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,963
look through a micros--
or a telescope,

431
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,382
you can see a lot more stars
than just the seven stars

432
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,175
that we see.

433
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,301
>> Yes.

434
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,930
>> We-- we realize we did take a
tangent off into something else

435
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,681
from what you were asking.

436
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,183
Basically speaking,
we're actually

437
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,644
going to jump back
and answer part

438
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,521
of this question and the other
question that you had before.

439
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,943
Basically speaking, the beings
that you know of as Pleiadians

440
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,404
are not indigenous to the area
that you know of as Pleiades.

441
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,197
All right.

442
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:40,989
>> OK.

443
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,327
>> So we have, basically,
two genetic lines.

444
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,079
One comes from the ancient Lyra.

445
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,871
>> OK.

446
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,750
>> And one comes from the
ancient Lyra combined with

447
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,626
Earth genetics.

448
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,545
That's another story,
perhaps for another time.

449
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,547
So there's two
different lines that

450
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,093
eventually colonized in the area
that you know of as Pleiades.

451
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,845
So not really the Seven Sisters.

452
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,682
However, in the
ancient days, when

453
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,226
my people would visit
your people on Earth,

454
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,145
and we would be asked
where are we from, well,

455
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,981
if we pointed to
those seven stars--

456
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,773
>> Right.

457
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,068
>> --in that direction,
they got the point.

458
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,986
>> I see.

459
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,906
now the idea of humanity 
being a mixture well

460
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,618
of course, it's no surprise to
you that you know that there is

461
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,161
a genetic connection between us.

462
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,037
>> Yes.

463
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,499
>> And it comes from many,
many different sources,

464
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,501
some of which is the Lyran--

465
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:39,172
the original Lyran
template DNA and Pleiadians

466
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,173
evolving from that.

467
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,635
And then, also, working
with the genetics on Earth.

468
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:49,558
But we find this idea
of simply looking

469
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,019
at it genetically
to be extremely

470
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:57,858
limiting because nobody
is indigenous to anywhere.

471
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,736
You are originally one.

472
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,528
>> Correct.

473
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,448
>> So again, we have
to use metaphor.

474
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,657
>> Yes.

475
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,577
>> If you take
holographic film--

476
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,829
and the nature of
holographic film

477
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,042
is that if we were to
take a picture of an apple

478
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,712
and then cut up the
film in tiny pieces,

479
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,132
each tiny little piece would
have the complete image

480
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,383
of the apple.

481
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,178
And it doesn't matter how
small you cut those pieces.

482
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,054
>> Right.

483
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,266
>> So consciousness is
fractal in that way.

484
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,392
>> Yes.

485
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:37,230
>> And therefore, no matter
if you are a lowly human,

486
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,234
so to speak, on Earth,
here, at this time,

487
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:46,656
you are fractally and
holographically every other piece

488
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,449
as well.

489
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,450
>> Correct.

490
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,828
>> So in that sense, then, the
question is difficult to answer

491
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,914
because our default
setting is not linear.

492
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,706
>> Right.

493
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,375
>> And yet language is linear.

494
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,043
>> So you mean the Pleiadian--

495
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,419
where you are in
your evolution--

496
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,587
>> Yes.
>> --is not linear, correct?

497
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,380
>> Yes.

498
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,219
>> And in our human
system, our human OS,

499
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,595
is sort of in a linear sense.

500
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,387
>> Yes.

501
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,973
>> So we're trying
to match those.

502
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,766
>> Yes.

503
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,267
But you're really shifting.

504
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,311
>> Yeah.

505
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,106
My understanding is
that the Pleiadian

506
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,233
is a very feminine energy.

507
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,651
Is that correct?

508
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,611
Or is it very balanced,
in that sense?

509
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:30,992
I always perceived, or
felt, more feminine energy,

510
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,246
archetypal energy, related
to the Pleiadian energy.

511
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,205
>> Yes.

512
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,541
Well, what you're going
to find with-- again,

513
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
not a simple answer
to the question--

514
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,712
what you're going to
find with my species,

515
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,589
as well as many
of the other core

516
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,843
species in your galactic family,
is that there's generally

517
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,137
three eras of development.

518
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,932
The first era is more
of the infant species.

519
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,601
And it is in that
first era where

520
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,105
the issues, let's say, of each
species that need to be healed,

521
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,314
come up.

522
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,190
All right.

523
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,442
And then the second
era tends to be

524
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,238
the healing period when
the integration starts,

525
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,948
the healing happens.

526
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,910
The third era, which is,
of course, the mature era,

527
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,080
is when awakening, as
a species, happens.

528
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,961
So my species,
particularly, is felt

529
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,632
as feminine in all three eras,
which is really interesting.

530
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,260
And it's kind of rare because
many of the other species

531
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,261
are more felt masculine.

532
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,387
>> OK.

533
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,349
>> But the reason we are felt
more feminine in all three eras

534
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,101
is because as follows.

535
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,939
First era, we already
told you that the tendency

536
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,026
for my species was to not
want to look at the shadow.

537
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,113
So we were kind of floating
around in the spiritual bubble.

538
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,906
>> Right.

539
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:57,454
>> All right, which is actually
an unbalanced feminine energy.

540
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,246
>> Mm-hmm.

541
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,247
>> OK.

542
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,083
Then, when you go
to the second era,

543
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,670
and the integration happens,
integration, or the act

544
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,339
of integration,
by its very nature

545
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,758
is feminine because
it's inclusive.

546
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:15,096
So all of that integration was
creating a movement inward,

547
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,516
which is a very feminine energy.

548
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,602
And then, of course,
in the third era,

549
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,563
which is the awakened
era, you have a species

550
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,526
that is very balanced
male female energy that

551
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,238
is in an awakened state.

552
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,116
And to a separated
consciousness on Earth,

553
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,537
that state feels very feminine.

554
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,746
>> So that's why I--

555
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,207
we're-- you know, myself and
other people get that feeling.

556
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,667
>> Exactly.

557
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,962
And-- and this is going
into some other races,

558
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,965
but I was told that--

559
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,384
my understanding is
that the Anunnaki

560
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:59,474
were a hybrid race of Pleiadian
and Draconian energies.

561
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,185
Is that-- do you see it
from that perspective?

562
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,061
>> No.

563
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,938
We're going to be a little
bit of a rebel, here.

564
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,772
>> Sure.

565
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,485
>> Because the word Anunnaki
in your Sumerian language,

566
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,529
as far as we understand
the definition,

567
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,989
means those who have come down.

568
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,823
>> OK.

569
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,742
>> So Anunnaki is
meaning, basically,

570
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,077
those who came from the heavens.

571
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,869
>> OK.

572
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,288
>> So they were not one species.

573
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:21,913
>> I see.

574
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,747
>> They were many.

575
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,540
>> I see.

576
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,791
Oh, OK.

577
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,585
That-- well, that clears
up a lot of stuff.

578
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,086
A lot of questions I had.

579
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,878
>> Yes.

580
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,048
>> So that-- that
is interesting.

581
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,009
You know, we were trying
to figure out why--

582
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,637
where did the Anunnaki
get all this DNA

583
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,474
the old story of enslaving--
making humans for slaves--

584
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,267
>> Yes.

585
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,143
>> --for mining gold.

586
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,521
>> And that was only one
particular family that did

587
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,314
that.

588
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,106
>> OK.

589
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,817
>> But as you know, they're the
ones that get the bad rap, yes?

590
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,609
>> Right.

591
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,110
Right.

592
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,945
>> The rotten apple
spoils the bunch.

593
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,989
>> I see.

594
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:01,995
So speaking of DNA and when that
race of beings, or that family,

595
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:07,751
took all these various DNAs
from different star systems

596
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:14,090
and created the human
structure, um,

597
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,259
how did that work
in the beginning?

598
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,304
Or was there this--
again, this--

599
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,056
there had to be an
agreement of sorts,

600
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,806
otherwise it wouldn't
have happened.

601
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,266
>> Of course, there's
always an agreement.

602
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,100
>> Yeah.

603
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,938
>> However, again,
we have to say that--

604
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:33,652
we have to look at it from
a non-human perspective.

605
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:40,784
Now, you're quite familiar with
other channeled information

606
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,244
and such talking
about, basically,

607
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,789
if something is happening,
or something is arising,

608
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,457
there must be a higher purpose.

609
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,752
And that is not, in any
way, meant to be a cop out.

610
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,544
All right.

611
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,421
It's simply the way
the universe works.

612
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,214
>> Sure.

613
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,465
>> There is no mistakes--

614
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,257
>> Absolutely.

615
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,759
>> --in creation.

616
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,470
Now, in those
ancient days, we have

617
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,682
to say that your Earth,
or your solar system,

618
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,394
could be likened to what you
call the wild, wild west.

619
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,186
>> Yeah.

620
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,188
Feels like that
today, still, but--

621
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,023
>> Well, yes, it is.

622
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,816
It is.

623
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,734
But it's a little bit
more colonized now.

624
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,527
>> Sure.

625
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,406
>> So it was an isolated place.

626
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:24,452
And because of that
isolation, a lot went on,

627
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,622
that was very fragmented
with groups, one group having

628
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,668
one agenda, one group having
another agenda and conflicts

629
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,169
and things such as that.

630
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,923
All because these
forefathers of yours

631
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,175
were a very young species.

632
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,262
This doesn't happen
with older species.

633
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,097
Only with younger ones.

634
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,224
>> I see.

635
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,936
So you sort of answered
the question earlier,

636
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,106
that, yes, there was some
sort of higher purpose.

637
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,988
And therefore, these other
races sort of lend their DNA

638
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,781
for this higher purpose.

639
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,740
>> Yes.

640
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,453
>> It wasn't stolen or
taken and put-- you know,

641
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm going to go drug the
Arcturian and then grab some

642
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,499
DNA or some mojo--

643
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,292
>> Yes.

644
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,169
That makes a wonderful
science fiction movie.

645
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:14,961
>> Sure.

646
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,880
>> But it's not quite
the way things work.

647
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,672
>> Sure.

648
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,383
>> One of the things that we've
said to many people, sometimes,

649
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:25,555
that ask questions about this
is that from the perspective

650
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,099
outside of the Earth, or from
a fourth density perspective,

651
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,062
let's say, this idea of the
sharing of DNA and the shaping

652
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:39,694
of cultures using DNA is
actually a very natural

653
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,196
process.

654
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,697
It's kind of like pollination--

655
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,490
>> Right.

656
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,949
>> --on your world.

657
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,745
And when you look at
it-- when you remove

658
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,165
the victim-perpetrator idea--

659
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,957
>> Right.

660
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,836
>> --which is really only
applicable in a very polarized

661
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:01,591
third density reality, then
the whole paradigm changes,

662
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,383
actually.

663
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,176
>> Right.

664
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,304
>> But the question,
then, is why?

665
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,724
Why do people have
these experiences

666
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,976
of being a victim and
things such as that.

667
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,769
>> Sure.

668
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,271
>> Why do those
buttons get pushed?

669
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,483
Well, when you are a
third-density species,

670
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,859
in a sense, you
can say there are

671
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,071
many passages, spiritual
passages, that you

672
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,407
have to go through in order
to evolve your consciousness

673
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,326
on the way to fourth density.

674
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:33,331
One of those passages has
to do with the healing

675
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,669
of the clinging to the idea
of victim and perpetrator.

676
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,966
And many civilizations get
stuck there for millennia.

677
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,968
And so when you
have-- well, we're

678
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,469
bringing in another
tangent, here.

679
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,262
>> No, that's fine.

680
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,056
>> But when you have the
situation with the Zetas

681
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:55,144
and the so-called abductions,
it triggered the same issues

682
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:59,399
humanity has been playing out
for so many thousands of years,

683
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,776
but this time from space.

684
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,735
Are there victims?

685
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,320
Are there perpetrators?

686
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,407
And on the individual
level of those

687
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:12,495
who were claiming abduction,
the reason it's happening

688
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,873
is because they have to
pass through that gate

689
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,416
in order to shift
their consciousness

690
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,835
and integrate the polarity
within themselves.

691
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,796
And then, on a
collective level, it

692
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,382
happens on a collective
level, as well,

693
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,010
that changing of the paradigm.

694
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,680
And therefore, a passage
into fourth density

695
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,766
can be made, or one of
the steps of the passage.

696
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,477
>> So without the
Zeta abduction,

697
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:41,399
temporary detainment,
experience, then,

698
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,736
we wouldn't even have the
opportunity to heal that wound

699
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,987
to move into fourth density.

700
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,779
>> Exactly.

701
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,948
Or you would have
re-created something else.

702
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,866
>> Some other scenario.

703
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,700
>> Yes.

704
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,660
>> Yeah, we would have.

705
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,871
But at least we got
to have it in that way

706
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,706
so we could connect
to our cosmic family.

707
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,498
>> Exactly.

708
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:03,963
>> As opposed to, you know,
making another story on Earth.

709
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,674
>> Yes, because in the
Orion civilization,

710
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:11,679
they didn't create that-- the
healing of that through the ET

711
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,472
contact.

712
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,807
They created it through
a domineering empire.

713
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,600
>> Right.

714
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,435
And that was the Orion Wars?

715
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,811
>> Yes.

716
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:24,567
>> Was-- was the Pleiadian--
your society involved in those

717
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,110
wars?

718
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,862
>> Shamefully, yes.

719
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,780
We're making a joke.

720
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,864
>> Right.

721
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:35,036
>> Now, again, those
conflicts lasted for a very,

722
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,037
very long time.

723
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:40,875
So there was a period of time,
when my species was very young,

724
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:45,254
that our mindset was
kind of like a teenager

725
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,090
in your human counting.

726
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,218
You know, gung ho, do this,
jump in without thinking

727
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,052
of the consequences.

728
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:51,886
>> Right.

729
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,346
>> And so we did that.

730
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,973
And as you say in
your vernacular,

731
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,059
got our asses kicked.

732
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,270
And that brought up
the issues of the guilt

733
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:05,358
and all that kind of stuff that
we had to work on as a species

734
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,026
in order to make our shift.

735
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:11,406
So in that way, there's
nothing extraneous.

736
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,785
>> So now, obviously, that
period of time is over

737
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,539
and, hopefully, the Orion--

738
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,331
and we say now.

739
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,125
And obviously time--
and I guess, you know,

740
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,254
I'm just-- where you
are with your evolution,

741
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,338
you've cleared that up.

742
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,381
You've been through that.

743
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,509
You've had this-- we have the
story of the Orion Wars to tell

744
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,177
to-- so we can keep--

745
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:33,970
you heal--

746
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,637
>> Yes.

747
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,638
>> --some future generations.

748
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,765
Because hey, we've been
there, we've done that.

749
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,809
>> Yes.

750
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,729
And there are some residuals
finishing up on your world,

751
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,563
as well.

752
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,063
>> Right.

753
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,148
With the Orion Wars.

754
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:45,606
>> Yes.

755
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,399
>> OK.

756
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,360
And because again-- so I've--

757
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,737
you know, I've
heard this analogy

758
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,240
that everything that's
happening on Earth is sort of--

759
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,742
the micro and the macro, so--

760
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,118
>> Yes.

761
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,203
>> --you know, if we go
back just 20 years maybe

762
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,291
in our timeline, then the Orion
Wars are still happening kind

763
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,127
of in a way, depending on which
timeline we're in, I guess.

764
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:11,340
>> It really depends on what
you are connecting with,

765
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,216
energetically.

766
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,009
>> Right.

767
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,763
And so that-- instead of looking
at it from a linear sense,

768
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,807
the vibrational frequency
of where we're at,

769
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,601
if we're vibrating
at that frequency,

770
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,519
then, yes, the Orion
Wars are still happening.

771
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,437
>> Exactly.

772
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,229
>> OK.

773
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,232
>> For instance, people in your
world who live in the Middle

774
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:33,988
East, who are embroiled in
extreme polarity and extreme

775
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,781
control--

776
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,741
>> Yeah.

777
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,746
>> --are directly connecting,
still, to that era of Orion.

778
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,538
>> Right.

779
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,000
>> Whereas, perhaps, you,
in your daily life, are not.

780
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,793
>> Correct.

781
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,835
I see.

782
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,756
So instead of seeing time
linearly in that sense,

783
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,508
it's just more of a
vibrational frequency.

784
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,176
>> Yes, and it's very fluid.

785
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,094
>> Right.

786
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,014
And that-- so we can sort of see
time in our daily lives, too.

787
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,851
And if we can see everything
as a vibrational frequency,

788
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,272
then, maybe we can get through,
navigate through this frequency

789
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,775
soup, I like to call
it, a little bit easier.

790
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,651
>> Yes.

791
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,693
You're in a very--

792
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,279
as you well know, you're in
a very interesting time right

793
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,242
now, because in a sense you have
one foot in third density, one

794
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,159
foot in fourth.

795
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,371
You're taking the foot
out of third density.

796
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,915
But because it's a
spectrum, and there's

797
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,584
a gradation as the
energy changes,

798
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,711
you're still going
to have challenges

799
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,172
with the old way of doing
things as the new structures are

800
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:33,965
arising.

801
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,757
>> Right.

802
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,052
>> So this is really the most
tenuous time and also the most

803
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:38,886
challenging one.

804
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,012
>> Right.

805
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,224
But also the most--

806
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,016
>> Exciting.

807
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:48,604
>> --exciting because the
shift, the daily shifts,

808
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,899
are happening at such an
exponential rate that we really

809
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,276
can take notice.

810
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,152
>> Yes.

811
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,486
>> And see these changes.

812
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,279
>> Yes.

813
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,531
>> And that's exciting.

814
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,323
>> Exactly, yes.

815
00:35:59,323 --> 00:35:59,532
>> Exciting.

816
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,659
>> And it's exciting
for us to watch, too.

817
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,451
>> Right.

818
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,079
Exactly.

819
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,331
we're having this conversation
with Lisa and Ron,

820
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,042
earlier, about the-- we
call it the Mandela Effect,

821
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:15,298
is the internet terminology
for what seems to be,

822
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,093
from one perspective, a
shifting of timelines.

823
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:19,969
>> Yes.

824
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,179
>> And it's almost
now been labeled.

825
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,891
Now, we have a
collective name for it.

826
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,895
And we're seeing pieces
in our history shifting

827
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,104
from the way we remember it.

828
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:30,897
>> Yes.

829
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,359
>> And we're going back and
reviewing movies and tangible,

830
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,987
physical things, that the
way we remembered them,

831
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,238
they weren't that way before.

832
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,031
>> Yes.

833
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,159
>> Is this the actual
shifting of timelines?

834
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,369
>> It is the you--

835
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,831
as we were just talking about a
moment ago, time is more fluid.

836
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,624
>> Right.

837
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:54,629
>> When you are rooted,
let's say, in third density,

838
00:36:54,629 --> 00:37:00,092
time feels and is perceived
as being more fixed.

839
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:04,138
But now you're moving more
into a fluid sense of time.

840
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,975
And that means,
then, that you are--

841
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,435
again, it's a metaphor.

842
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
It's the limit of the language.

843
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,562
>> Sure.

844
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,191
>> You are spending more
time in the quantum state

845
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,985
of consciousness where
all possibilities exist.

846
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,778
>> Right.

847
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,030
>> And you are, thus, able to--

848
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,366
remember, we were talking
about the blinking in and out,

849
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,450
or the in and out breath.

850
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,242
>> Right.

851
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:31,958
>> You are able to shift the
timelines much more rapidly.

852
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,335
But in the past
when you did it, you

853
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,504
didn't remember
the previous one.

854
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,715
But now, as you are spending
more time in the quantum,

855
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,593
you're becoming more
familiar and comfortable

856
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,138
with that energy, that
you're starting to remember

857
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,724
the other parallels.

858
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,019
Not in a schizophrenic
way, but in a way

859
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,772
that's meant to just tell--

860
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,273
that's meant to just show you--

861
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,358
>> Right.

862
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,987
>> --look how fluid you are
becoming, you are unlocking.

863
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,905
>> And that's where the
excitement-- you know,

864
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,948
this is--
>> Yes.

865
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
So now, you're beginning
to see that the future--

866
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,828
you've always seen
the future as fluid,

867
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,080
but now, you're seeing
the past as fluid, too.

868
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,748
>> Exactly.

869
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,668
And-- and we can rewrite
the story if we want to.

870
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,088
>> Yes, but the ego can
never rewrite anything.

871
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,006
>> Ah, the ego.

872
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,798
Yes.

873
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,467
>> Yes, yes, ah, the ego.

874
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,260
>> Interesting.

875
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,389
>> This is where people who do
manifestation work get stuck.

876
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,181
>> Ah, yes.

877
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,309
>> Because the ego
takes over the show.

878
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,435
>> Right.

879
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,644
I can see that.

880
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,604
I can absolutely see that.

881
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,733
So we want to rewrite the
story, but we can't really

882
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,525
rewrite the story.

883
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,777
We just have to--

884
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,904
we can't rewrite the past
story, but we can rewrite

885
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,823
the now story with our choices.

886
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,615
>> Yes.

887
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,075
You can rewrite the now story.

888
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,453
Now, when we talk about now,
we're talking about now.

889
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,245
>> Right.

890
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:51,829
>> And now.

891
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,121
And now.

892
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,497
We're not talking about
one second from now.

893
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,206
>> Sure.

894
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:54,999
>> All right.

895
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,462
So the only thing, then,
that you have in the now

896
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,464
is your experience of the now.

897
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,256
>> Right.

898
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,842
>> So therefore, what you
are really rewriting is

899
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,218
your experience of the now--

900
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,011
>> Right.

901
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,014
>> --which really has to do with
your interpretation of the now.

902
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,475
>> And that, depending
on that interpretation,

903
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,685
will set us on a specific
vibrational frequency.

904
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,686
>> Exactly.

905
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,147
>> And then, depending on
that vibrational frequency,

906
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,066
we see the past rewrite itself.

907
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:20,858
>> Exactly.

908
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,944
So if your interpretation of the
now is one of victimization--

909
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:24,779
>> Sure.

910
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,238
>> --guess what
you're going to get.

911
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:30,326
>> We're going to get a past
history of Zetas abducting you

912
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,660
every night against your will.

913
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,453
>> Yes.

914
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,872
>> And if you are at a
vibrational frequency

915
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,792
of non-victimization,
empowerment, then,

916
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:42,546
you're going to be going on the
ships and donating your stuff

917
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,799
instead of actually being
taken against your will.

918
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,591
>> Yes.

919
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,260
And even-- getting out--

920
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,930
getting out of the ET stuff--
even we're talking about,

921
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,681
is your boss picking
on you at work?

922
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,474
>> Sure.

923
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,351
>> So we're even talking
about the human stuff here.

924
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:55,768
>> Right.

925
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,560
Right.

926
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,229
And then, shifting
that perspective,

927
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,523
shifting that now moment,
now all of a sudden your boss

928
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:06,112
is not picking on you, but got
a greater plan or, you know,

929
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,279
something, some other story.

930
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,405
>> Exactly.

931
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,908
And this brings in
the whole other aspect

932
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,995
of the emotional body because
the ego, the insidious ego--

933
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,039
we say that with love
because the ego is simply

934
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,541
a neutral mechanism.

935
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,168
But the insidious ego
will continue its dialogue

936
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,088
with you that will
tell you, well,

937
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,258
if you're not shifting this
now, you're not very spiritual.

938
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,259
You're bad.

939
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,343
You're failing.

940
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,887
And that that just
further entrenches--

941
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,680
>> Right.

942
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
>> --the anchor of the ego.

943
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,434
>> So it's just a big lesson
of allowance and acceptance.

944
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,394
>> Exactly.

945
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,186
Exactly.

946
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,771
>> And just being, really.

947
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,858
And not the knee jerk reactions.

948
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,650
>> Exactly.

949
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,403
And watching yourself
so that you can

950
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,488
see your habits and patterns.

951
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,615
And that's the key
to your freedom.

952
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,827
And by embracing those
emotions when they come,

953
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,162
as opposed to pushing them away.

954
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:56,954
>> Exactly.

955
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,164
>> Ok.

956
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:03,252
Now I've heard different 
stories on the Zeta race

957
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,630
is, I've heard in one scenario that the

958
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,426
Zeta's have died off, that they, you know,

959
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,927
they created the hybrid races, they couldn't

960
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,931
continue to reproduce so they eventually died off.

961
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,850
And I've heard other stories now

962
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,437
that the Zetas are continuing their evolution

963
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,731
because of their interaction with humans,

964
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,357
they've actually activated their emotional

965
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:30,196
bodies and are thriving quite well.

966
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,031
And I don't know if they're back to

967
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,618
reproducing, but at least they're on that path.

968
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,038
And I'm assuming there's two different

969
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,289
timelines that these are happening?

970
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,624
How does this work?

971
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:47,087
Well, as with any species, if there is an

972
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,049
aspect of the species that refuses to

973
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,510
change, that portion of it will die off.

974
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,261
>>Okay.

975
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:54,887
>>Alright?

976
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,598
But, as we were talking about

977
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,643
before, regarding the three eras of

978
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,895
most of the physical species that you're

979
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,565
connected with, the Zetas also have their three eras.

980
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:11,070
So the first era was the era of their species crisis,

981
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,367
and when they weren't able to reproduce and the

982
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,494
emotional body was cut off etc.

983
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:24,583
The second era started to take place as the

984
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,670
interactions with humans began, and all

985
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,632
through the interaction period, for their species,

986
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,801
it meant the reintegration with the

987
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,679
emotional body through the work with humans.

988
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,056
But also through the creation of

989
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,892
the hybrid species because... And you know

990
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,978
the whole story, the drama about learning

991
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,604
to nurture them and things such as that.

992
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,397
>>Right, yes.

993
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,941
>>And all of those challenges they

994
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:53,737
had in the second era helped their integration process.

995
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,156
Then the third era

996
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,076
Zeta, we would call the awakened ones.

997
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,952
Mmm hmm.

998
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,288
So this is a very, very high level Zeta

999
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,834
consciousness that... then talking about

1000
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,253
parallel timelines, in the 80's and the 90's,

1001
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,006
very few people on Earth were

1002
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,841
tapping into that third level Zeta

1003
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,759
consciousness, because people were still

1004
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,555
processing the more polarized victim consciousness.

1005
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,472
>>Correct.

1006
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:24,435
>>But we would say really beginning

1007
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,731
five to ten years ago on Earth, your...

1008
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,733
many of you are now starting

1009
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,736
to tap into the third era Zeta

1010
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,571
consciousness when they have awakened.

1011
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,073
So their emotional bodies, mental bodies, all

1012
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,034
of that, came into alignment and

1013
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,786
integration.  And they've become like an

1014
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:47,416
elder race that is very... acting very much

1015
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,710
as mentors for younger species now....

1016
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,837
Wow, how does that all work?

1017
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,548
I guess, to put it in a, in a linear... And

1018
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,884
again,  this is our linear minds trying to

1019
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,094
figure this out, because we have very

1020
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,055
advanced future versions of the

1021
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,265
Essassani and Bashar coming in and talking to us;

1022
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,683
the Yahyel, we have other

1023
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,644
channelers bringing in different beings

1024
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,229
from the Yahyel civilization.

1025
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,564
And I'm assuming that they look

1026
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,109
up to the Zeta, that third tier of the

1027
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,569
Zetas that we were just talking about. >>Yes.

1028
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,196
>>That they're interacting with them on

1029
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,240
that level. >>Yes, like grandfathers. >>Right

1030
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,450
grandfathers, because I'm sure

1031
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,410
their vibrational frequency is at that

1032
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,621
higher level, so they're ... in their reality,

1033
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,165
in their timeline, they still exist.

1034
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,919
Yes.  They didn't die off.  >>Yes.  >>And yet

1035
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,589
we're humans in this level and, you know we're...

1036
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:39,510
how does that interaction... I don't know...

1037
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,762
Could you go into depth a little bit about that?

1038
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,472
>>My goodness, we're not sure exactly, because there's

1039
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,016
so many tangents we could go off at.

1040
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,978
Is there a specific curiosity and we can start there?

1041
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,568
>>I... The... It's... It has to do with time and

1042
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:01,532
the sense that we have these different

1043
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,911
aspects of the Yahyel and the Essassani, and

1044
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,996
even the Zetas, coming back at this

1045
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,499
particular time, that version of them.  Why not...

1046
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,334
And even the version of yourself, why not

1047
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,963
an earlier version of, of the Pleiadean...

1048
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,006
>>Ah, all right.  >>And then we, and then we have

1049
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,551
higher density, dimensional

1050
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,469
collectives of the Pleiadians also visiting us.

1051
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,514
>>Yes, well, it's back to what we were

1052
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,391
talking about earlier regarding

1053
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,019
frequency compatibility.  >>Okay.  >>And also

1054
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,356
what you're calling in to push you to

1055
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,774
move to another level.

1056
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:39,361
>>Okay, I see.  >>So you have, you have one aspect

1057
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,197
that is the challenge aspect that pushes

1058
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,241
you, and you have another aspect that is

1059
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,952
more of a mentorship level.  >>I see.

1060
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:51,540
>>Okay, so for instance, you on your world, you

1061
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,877
have some UFO lore, if you wish to call

1062
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,212
it that, from the 60's or 70's -

1063
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,674
the Billy Meier Pleiadian contacts?  >>Oh yes, yeah. >>Alright,

1064
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,595
and so sometimes people ask "Sasha, do you

1065
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,347
know Semjase?" Okay.  Well from

1066
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,267
my perspective, my time, she is a past

1067
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,896
figure.  >>Okay.  >>Long, long gone.  >>Right.  >>Not

1068
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,815
in physical body any more, but in your time

1069
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,443
stream in the 70's you were pulling

1070
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,737
in those Pleiadian contacts because that's

1071
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,780
what you needed.

1072
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,698
>>I see.  >>Now you're pulling in different

1073
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,366
types of Pleiadian contacts because

1074
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,869
that's what you need as well .  So the

1075
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:33,957
Essassani, the Essassani especially, and the

1076
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,543
hybrid species are playing a very

1077
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,795
important role that has to do with

1078
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:43,425
alchemy.  What do we mean by that?  Well the

1079
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,052
idea of alchemy is the bringing together

1080
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,972
of two seemingly conflicting ideas that

1081
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,267
create a response when they come

1082
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,603
together to create a third idea.  >>Right.

1083
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:59,525
>>And this is, let's say, energy dynamics

1084
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:04,321
101 in terms of species evolution.  So

1085
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,574
whenever you get to a planet that is

1086
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,202
moving from 3rd to 4th density, they

1087
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,745
are going to have to integrate the

1088
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,497
mental and emotional bodies, and they do

1089
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,333
so through a form of alchemy.  So the

1090
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,920
Essassani, in a sense, are the alchemists or

1091
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,756
the representations of successful

1092
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:27,427
alchemy.  >>Okay.  >>And you see it at a... through

1093
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,763
the combination of Zeta and human, but

1094
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,558
also through what they actually

1095
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,351
integrated, which is the mental and

1096
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,770
emotional bodies.  >>I've heard

1097
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,731
Bashar speak that the Essassani are

1098
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:44,236
closely related to the Sirius energy.

1099
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,154
>>Yes.

1100
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,534
...in terms of Bashar, you will

1101
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,414
find that the flow of energy for the

1102
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,876
Essassani evolution moves toward a higher

1103
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,171
non-physical Sirian vibration for its

1104
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,675
future selves.  So you find that a lot of...

1105
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,261
there's a lot of future incarnations

1106
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:13,682
that move from the Essassani to the Sirian.

1107
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,727
And we would call that third era Sirian

1108
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,939
beings, again, the awakened ones.  >>I see.  And

1109
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,149
humanity,

1110
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,151
it seems like we're in a crossroads

1111
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,193
right now, because we have so many

1112
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:29,656
directions we can go with our evolution.

1113
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,033
>> Yes.

1114
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,619
>>We can go towards the Sirian direction of

1115
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,037
evolution; we can go towards the

1116
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,497
Pleiadian direction; we can even go

1117
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,334
towards the Draconian... >>Yes  >>...way of

1118
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,419
evolution, and in specific time

1119
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,589
lines we are doing it all simultaneously.  >>Exactly, yes.

1120
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,508
>>Okay.  And its really up to us individually

1121
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:54,264
to see which one we want to be a part of.

1122
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,224
>>So we go back then to what we were

1123
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,352
talking about a few moments ago, about...

1124
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,688
Because the ego cannot control the

1125
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,400
trajectory, all you have is the current

1126
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,112
moment.  So in the current moment your

1127
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,365
trajectory becomes clear.

1128
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,327
So this is some work Lyssa, Germane and

1129
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,038
myself have been doing with those, with

1130
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,707
using the Galactic cards to help bring

1131
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:26,088
the focus with people to what is

1132
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,340
happening for them in this moment now?

1133
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,510
And lets say it's an emotional

1134
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,971
pattern that's more anchored in past

1135
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,972
Pleiadian, or an emotional pattern that's

1136
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,976
more anchored in past Zeta, then these

1137
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:44,189
become icons almost or, or archetypal

1138
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,608
stories that can help you move through

1139
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,069
in this moment now whatever your

1140
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,114
challenge is, and it ripples through time

1141
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,616
in both directions.  Because ultimately...

1142
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,661
Again, going back to the seven rooms,

1143
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,664
seven concentric circles, you are the one

1144
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,209
and your fragments are inside the one, so

1145
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,794
you're never really outside of anything

1146
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:11,717
and everything is you anyway.
