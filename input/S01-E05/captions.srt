1
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,353
My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,231
and that is a clever name myself and Kalina fell into

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,567
so it was a great synchronicity

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,027
and the reason that it fits is because

5
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,405
throughout the last 7 years

6
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,741
I've contacted or channeled over

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,785
100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.

8
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,622
I've not done collective consciousnesses as much,

9
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,958
but I have tapped into some of those,

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,084
some Archangels

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,711
but for some reason

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,504
the ET thing sticks with me very well

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,506
and it fits the energy very well

14
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,049
so thats where I like to stay in

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,760
My connection process is a little different

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,677
than the rest of the channelers.

17
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,888
That seems a little odd to some people

18
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,389
but basically what I'm gonna do,

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,099
I'm gonna breathe for a little bit and then

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,226
I'm gonna make some very loud Oming sounds

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,978
and then I'm gonna breathe a little more,

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,646
and then Aridif will join us.

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,232
The Oming sounds are resonant tuning.

24
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,942
You guys can join along if you want.

25
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,527
You guys can breathe all you want.

26
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,946
That Oming gets your Chakra's vibrating,

27
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,699
and that's how it helps me connect to Aridif.

28
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,952
So enjoy yourself and remember every question you ask

29
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,537
that's personal in nature

30
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,081
is a reflection from your own consciousness.

31
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,751
And Aridif will look at your energy,

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,420
he'll see any energy that it connects to,

33
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,965
your higher self, your oversoul, Archangels, whatever.

34
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,842
He'll see it connecting to it and then

35
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,552
he will be able to reflect it back

36
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,430
from his perception and his connections, so

37
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,890
remember to have fun!

38
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,267
Remember to enjoy yourselves and...

39
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,228
I love you guys.

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:56,074
(Oming sounds)

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,205
(Oming sounds)

42
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,668
Greetings to you all this is Aridif.

43
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,504
That is Ａ･Ｒ･Ｉ･Ｄ･Ｉ･Ｆ

44
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,256
and this is it spelled.

45
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,800
I know that many of you have queries of your own

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,344
in this evening, we will begin in one moment.

47
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,512
But first

48
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,681
we wish to discuss the co-creation of

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,808
the magnitude in which you have all placed

50
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,726
your own energy, that you have all

51
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,979
placed your own excitement and love,

52
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,689
time and effort into...

53
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,400
...making come to fruition for all others

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,653
in your experience, and outside of it, in this evening.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,946
First of all,

56
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,573
when all of you understand that

57
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,199
many are aware of what is happening

58
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,118
in this moment, in this time

59
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,703
...but there are many who have no

60
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,705
concept or clue that this event

61
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,874
in the way it is happening, is happening

62
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,127
or that it is happening at all, in this evening.

63
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,046
But yet those who are around us are still affected

64
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,673
by your excitement,

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,302
by your co-creative collective consciousness.

66
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,013
By your own desires and excitement you build,

67
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,389
and this is what we have shared

68
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,807
from the beginning of the time

69
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,434
that we have come to Rob

70
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,477
and all of the time that we have connected to

71
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,645
Treb-BOR-yit-Ne

72
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,439
and all of humanity.

73
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,483
We've connected to humanity for thousands of years,

74
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,861
and different races of humans,

75
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,821
or different time periods of humans.

76
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,866
Different geography's than what we are now,

77
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,328
but we always have the capacity to teach and to share

78
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,414
what it is that we desire to teach and share

79
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,707
with all of you.

80
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,167
That is that you create

81
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,794
your own reality from thought.

82
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,380
You create your own reality

83
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,716
from your conscious mindset.

84
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,218
That in your co-creation with others

85
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,597
that you are creating not only the physical structure

86
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,598
around you

87
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,435
but all things that accompany the concepts

88
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,604
of exchanging energy.

89
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,773
Whether you are walking down the street

90
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,650
and seeing someone nod and wave,

91
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,363
that is a co-creation but it also created from yourself.

92
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,658
This dynamic is difficult for many humans to comprehend

93
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,952
"How are we able to create and co-create?"

94
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,412
"Is the one across from me, the one who is

95
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,207
being created or is co-creating with me?"

96
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,834
What we would say to this is, it does not matter!

97
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,379
What matters is your own excitement in the moment.

98
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,214
Your own ability to create

99
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,341
what you desire in each moment.

100
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,053
You take your energy and place it in many thought formats.

101
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,805
You place it in many thought forms

102
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,098
as you go through the day.

103
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,808
You think about the hardships

104
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,810
that you've had in your existence,

105
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,229
and that, because you are who you are,

106
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,939
and because of your history,

107
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,524
you should create more of that and

108
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,402
that is what your life is and you have settled for it.

109
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,237
But we understand that all of you

110
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,863
who are here in attendance

111
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,658
are starting to see greater aspects of yourself.

112
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,993
In each moment

113
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,286
you see yourself connecting

114
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,706
to other people who's excitement

115
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,709
matches. You're co-creating experiences

116
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,086
with entities who are not aware

117
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,631
of conscious mindset or what the word channeling means,

118
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,425
but yet you see them liven up,

119
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,051
you see their eyes sparkle,

120
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,886
you see them come to an excitement

121
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,849
in their own capacity to help co-create more excitement.

122
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,976
That is what this evening is about,

123
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,019
is excitement.

124
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,605
It is about creation, it is about co-creation.

125
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,567
What we have shared and what we will always share

126
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,695
is that we have a part in sharing our love with you.

127
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,156
You may do with it as you desire,

128
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,450
you may take the love that we send you

129
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,286
and use it for your own manifestations

130
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,205
of excitements, your own co-creations

131
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,291
or you may leave it at the door.

132
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,210
We do not mind what you do with the love we give you,

133
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,046
we just wish to send you this love.

134
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,090
And this is why we express in all time periods

135
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,926
that above all things that have been spoken of

136
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,553
in this evening by ourselves

137
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,307
is that you are loved is the most important point

138
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,726
When you say the words that you are loved,

139
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,228
it brings you an experience that feels different

140
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,607
than when someone expresses that I love you.

141
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,816
When I love you,

142
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,069
this means that two separate entities

143
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,279
that are segregated from one another

144
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,074
share love and send it to another person

145
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,325
who than accepts it but...

146
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,701
...when you are loved,

147
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,912
then that is all that needs to be said.

148
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,246
Love is around you.

149
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,499
If you desire it, you can accept it and

150
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,625
manifest with it.

151
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,877
Love is what creation is.

152
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,004
It is what all consciousness is made from.

153
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,923
And you as a non-physical entity

154
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,675
are aligned with that energy if you desire.

155
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,677
To realign with yourself,

156
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,181
all you must do is open yourself for the experience.

157
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,809
Now a part of that experience is understanding

158
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,394
things upon a deeper level.

159
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,021
So what we can share with you in this evening

160
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,315
is perhaps give you a reflection on

161
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,900
the questions you desire

162
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,945
in order to co-create a better understanding

163
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,031
for you to open your own energy up to the more love

164
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,866
around you if you desire.

165
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,370
And if you do not we are still here to share it.

166
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,039
You may begin with your queries at your leisure.

167
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,918
Ever wondered if their is intelligent

168
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,336
life elsewhere in the universe?

169
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,215
Well, I have, I've been wondering since I was a kid.

170
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
My name is Reuben Langdon.

171
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,930
And on March 29th, 2007, in the middle of the day,

172
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,059
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

173
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,561
Coincidentally, I was working on

174
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,813
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

175
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,150
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

176
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,111
To find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

177
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,822
...are they here with us?

178
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,329
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

179
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,165
...what is their purpose?

180
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,876
Why don't they make themselves more known?

181
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,086
Why the secrecy?

182
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,338
I've asked these questions to many experts,

183
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,008
Yet, each seems to have a different theory.

184
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,468
So I thought to myself,

185
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,054
why not ask the aliens directly?

186
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,098
So that's what I've set out to do!

187
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,475
Well, sort of...

188
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,111
>> All right.

189
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,946
Well, here we are.

190
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,781
We're with Rob Gauthier.

191
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,244
And you channel a couple
of amazing beings.

192
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,579
More than a couple,
I should say.

193
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,081
How about you tell
us about yourself

194
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,417
and how did you get into this
whole channeling process?

195
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,544
>> Well, it's a bit of a story.

196
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,421
I always love explaining it.

197
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,592
But first, I was
a kid growing up

198
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,427
in a family that was
really Christian.

199
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,848
And Christianity was a big,
big part of my life as a child,

200
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,726
growing up into a
younger teenager.

201
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,397
At about 13, which is the
natural time of rebellion

202
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,400
for most, I kind of went
through this experience

203
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,027
where I separated
myself from it.

204
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,862
Growing up, I had
all these questions.

205
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,993
And every time I would ask the
preacher or a person esteemed

206
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,995
on the board of the
church directors,

207
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,330
or whoever, just someone
who is knowledgeable,

208
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,208
they never could really give an
answer that was complete to me.

209
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,295
It always seemed like
it just went back to,

210
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,173
because the Bible says so, or
because the church says so.

211
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,592
And I had a friend
who would go with me.

212
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,387
And we were both pretty
critical of the whole thing.

213
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,224
So after exploring that, I
kind of did my own thing.

214
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,561
I let science be
a big part of what

215
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,980
my reality was at that point.

216
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,733
In school, I did pretty
well with science.

217
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,525
I enjoyed it.

218
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,444
Earth science, especially.

219
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,113
And going through
that time period,

220
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,991
I distanced myself more
and more from the church.

221
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,286
After a few years,
I just quit going.

222
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,747
And not to my mother's
liking either.

223
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,082
But we just kept going through.

224
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:29,879
And after a few years of
just being off and about,

225
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,506
I started going through a
real, real rebellious stage.

226
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,886
And that was a very
disconnected time in my life.

227
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,513
I hung out with a
lot of people who--

228
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,432
they did the gang
things in the '90s.

229
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
So violence was part of that.

230
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,435
Drugs.

231
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,812
All of those things
were a big part.

232
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,523
I started smoking a lot of pot.

233
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,900
It wasn't an expansive thing.

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,485
It was fun.

235
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,694
So it was in my destructive--

236
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,403
>> It was a party thing.

237
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,154
>> Yes, it was.

238
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,905
Exactly.

239
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,697
>> Right.

240
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,742
Not Native American going
into the woods and--

241
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
>> No drumming circle.

242
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,497
>> No drumming circle, calling
in the Great Spirit Bear.

243
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,414
>> No.

244
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,417
But there were a lot of bears
there, just the wrong kind.

245
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,251
>> Right, right.

246
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,129
>> And it was fun.

247
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,673
And it was violent, destructive.

248
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,300
And it was a big
part of my life.

249
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,222
And I went that way until
right around the time

250
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,017
before I found out my son
was going to be on his way.

251
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,437
And I just kind of quit hanging
out with people a few months

252
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,480
before then.

253
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,400
Maybe it was intuition,
looking back.

254
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,859
>> A big responsibility coming.

255
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,986
>> Well, it was the first
time in my life I looked

256
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,074
at an aspect of something
that wasn't myself.

257
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
Everything was
centered around myself.

258
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,786
Even though I had
people who I loved

259
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,706
and were a part of my life,
up until then, it was just me.

260
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,376
And knowing this
responsibility--

261
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,836
the moment of
change really didn't

262
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,671
come till the day he was born.

263
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,341
He was born with a lot
of physical problems.

264
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,384
Cerebral palsy.

265
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,803
>> Did you know that right
away, right when he was born?

266
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,762
>> Not to the extent,

267
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,596
no.

268
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,098
They told us that
he had problems.

269
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,228
So when he came out, he did
not have any breath on his own.

270
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,730
They had to hook
him up to machines.

271
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
So I knew that
there was an issue.

272
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
But I didn't know the
extent of the issue.

273
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,109
>> I see.

274
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,070
>> They basically sent us home
and said, here's some medicine.

275
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,781
There's a possibility
he might have seizures.

276
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,535
We've seen some brain
waves that weren't normal.

277
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
So they sent me back.

278
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,038
And I took care of him.

279
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,249
And I didn't really
know the extent

280
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,918
of how bad it was
until he started

281
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,337
missing all the physical
marks. Like they'll say

282
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,256
at six months he's
supposed to lift his head,

283
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,550
and at three months, to do this.

284
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,593
And he missed all of them.

285
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,427
>> I see.

286
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,887
>> When he was
about two years old,

287
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,346
we took him back to the doctor.

288
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,598
And that's when I really knew.

289
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,809
And that's when the depression
in myself really started.

290
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,978
That's when the true
disconnection that I'd

291
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,647
experienced actually happened.

292
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,400
>> You were disconnected--
just the whole experience,

293
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,406
having a son in this state,
it was just hard to cope with?

294
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,282
>> Yeah.

295
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,159
It's the thought of knowing.

296
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,995
And when they tell me,
they don't tell me, hey,

297
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,913
your son has a problem.

298
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,749
They're like, he
has severe problems.

299
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,958
He'll never walk.

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
He'll never talk.

301
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,378
He'll probably be
like a vegetable.

302
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,672
And that's pretty much how
the doctor explained that.

303
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,548
>> Man.

304
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,424
Doctors.

305
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,217
>> Yeah, no bedside manner.

306
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,885
I know.

307
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,678
>> And then I guess,
they always say, well,

308
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,890
we're trained to tell
you the worst in case.

309
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,143
And that's not a good training.

310
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,102
>> Right.

311
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,064
Well, knowing what we know now
and what we thought, it's bad.

312
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,524
So it hit me like
a ton of bricks.

313
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:36,899
>> Sure.

314
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,691
Sure.

315
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,694
>> It was something that I
made myself try to cope with,

316
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,112
but I could not on my own.

317
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:42,905
>> Right.

318
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,449
>> I didn't have any
spiritual things in my life.

319
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,077
Before all I could
depend on was pot.

320
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,621
And that's what helped take the
edge off throughout my whole

321
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,956
teens and young 20's.

322
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:57,419
So from the time I found
out that my son's mother was

323
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,923
pregnant to the time he was
two, I had really pulled away

324
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,966
from my old lifestyle.

325
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,386
But now I immersed
back in it triplefold.

326
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,097
So it was more disconnection
than I ever experienced.

327
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,476
More-- my mind's going
crazy all the time.

328
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,895
No mental focus whatsoever.

329
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,730
So I go through that.

330
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,609
And it got real bad into the
depths of all sorts of things.

331
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:25,197
I even got into severe
drug use and pain--

332
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,117
I started with pain management
for a car crash I got into,

333
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,121
and it spiraled downhill
to the worst case scenario.

334
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,625
And after that, I spent many
years just kind of existing.

335
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,670
If I didn't get medicine,
I would be sick.

336
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,382
And my life really did
a tilt-a-whirl on me.

337
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,216
>> Right.

338
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,178
>> And that was the
worst time of my life.

339
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,932
And about seven
years into it, maybe

340
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:56,645
less than that, of really bad,
bad disconnection depression,

341
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,188
I finally started
coming out of it.

342
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,232
And I went through a lot
of steps to get there.

343
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,985
But the last step
included me actually

344
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,447
starting to see life again,
and starting to see--

345
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,532
and this is when I really
honed in on nature,

346
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,701
and I honed in on the animals.

347
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,162
Before I had pets, but
I never had an animal

348
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,747
that was connected to me.

349
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,958
I'd never seen it as an equal,
I'd seen it as property.

350
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,919
Those little changes
subtly creeped in.

351
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,297
And overnight it was just
an amazing difference

352
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,884
in perception, an amazing
difference in the way I felt.

353
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,595
And that's when my true
spiritual journey began.

354
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,514
That's when I really
started diving in.

355
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:37,227
One thing I always believed--
and science could not quench

356
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,773
my hunger for the desire
of how things started--

357
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,399
chemically, yes.

358
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,693
Engineering of the
universe, sure.

359
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,696
But never that god
that I knew was there.

360
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,489
>> Right.

361
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,033
>> So that was the one thing I
took into my beginning of this

362
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,576
spiritual journey, god.

363
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,788
And one thing too--
a lot of the times

364
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,167
during my whole life, UFOs,
ghosts, those two things

365
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,544
were really something
that my friend and I

366
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,380
had talked about all the time.

367
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,798
And there was never
an explanation

368
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,509
from the church or
science for either one.

369
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,303
And the afterlife
thing was always

370
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,471
something that amazed me.

371
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,015
I'd seen these
psychics on TV who

372
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,685
said I can talk to
spirits in the afterlife.

373
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,980
And I was very, very
skeptical, to say the least.

374
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,732
But some of the things they
would say would be profound.

375
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,068
And I thought, that's
a starting point.

376
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,986
Let's look into that.

377
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,448
I found a church that
integrated their desire

378
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,118
to look on the
other side of death,

379
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,579
so that they could bring
answers from the other side.

380
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,164
And they believe in God.

381
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,749
And they followed a
bit of the Bible

382
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,168
too, which was a comfort
zone, I guess, for me

383
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,795
from my childhood belief.

384
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,171
So I jumped in.

385
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,174
And when I went there,
they taught me meditation.

386
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,718
Right off the bat,
I got a reading

387
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,429
from the person, the
deacon, or the pastor,

388
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,639
whatever title he had,

389
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,015
and it was spot on.

390
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:57,808
He didn't know me.

391
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,643
No one from the church knew me.

392
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,187
No one had my social
media profile.

393
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,565
But yet, they told me
things about my son.

394
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,275
And they told me
things about relatives

395
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,735
that, at first, I had no clue.

396
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,613
But when I went to my
dad, who follows genealogy

397
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,866
and our family
tree. He said: Wow,

398
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,203
this person from six generations
ago had this and this.

399
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,455
So it was perfect.

400
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,706
>> So it matched up.

401
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,498
>> Synchronicity.

402
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,375
And it hit me so
hard that he could

403
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,294
have that kind of information.

404
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,504
That drew a level
of reality to me.

405
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,381
It drew some realness to it.

406
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,466
>> Well, just to back up.

407
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,969
When you said you started
noticing the animals

408
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,306
or I guess your perspective
on animals had changed,

409
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,433
was there a specific
event or something

410
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,934
that made that happen,

411
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,977
or did it just happen?

412
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,104
>> It was a lot
of little things.

413
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,775
For instance, the way my dogs
would come to me, instead

414
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,942
of just kind of--

415
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,360
they would always come
to get petted or something,

416
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,196
but they would come
and spend time with me.

417
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,197
Little things like that.

418
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:53,989
>> I see.

419
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,491
>> Going out in the woods.

420
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,701
As a younger person, I hunted.

421
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,660
It's Michigan culture.

422
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,037
>> Yeah.
>> I was raised here.

423
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:00,829
>> Right.

424
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,498
>> So I hunted all the time.

425
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,043
And the last time I went hunting
was right around that time.

426
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,795
I had a deer right in my sights.

427
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,838
I actually fell
asleep in the woods.

428
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,466
And I woke up, and this
deer is five foot from me.

429
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,760
And I had my gun,
unlocked the trigger,

430
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,179
put it right on the deer, and
I couldn't pull the trigger.

431
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,848
And after that, I never
went back out in the woods.

432
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,433
Those types of things.

433
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,393
Very hard, very big.

434
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,062
But a lot of little
things that led up

435
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,982
to it that really made me
understand what that connection

436
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:33,028
was a bit more than just
the animal-human perspective

437
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,281
that Christianity, and just
humans in general, believe in.

438
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,282
>> I see.

439
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,243
I remember you mentioned
before that you

440
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:44,331
had gotten involved with some
recordings from the Monroe

441
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,207
Institute.

442
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:45,791
>> Yes.

443
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,417
I would meditate all the time.

444
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,586
And I kept gaining
more experiences.

445
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,839
And I finally just kind
of pooped out on it,

446
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,549
and it just stopped.

447
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,218
After that, I started
looking online.

448
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,012
And that's when I found
the Monroe Institute.

449
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,597
I found some binaural stuff.

450
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,183
And then I found
Hemi-Sync, which was

451
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,394
the biggest and best out there.

452
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,687
It's what was claimed.

453
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,521
>> Right.

454
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,773
>> I started the Gateway
Experience course,

455
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,025
which was a six course--

456
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:16,738
six part per course, and then
six courses of meditation,

457
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,909
which increased my meditation
ability tremendously.

458
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,704
This is where all of the astral
projection states come in.

459
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,373
This is where all of the
out of body experiences--

460
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,419
it took my meditation to
such a level beyond anything

461
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,629
I thought was possible
at that point.

462
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,840
I had only used
meditation before to try

463
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,802
to open myself for communication
with spirits, dead humans.

464
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,970
That's all I cared about.

465
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,387
>> Oh, you did.

466
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,180
OK.

467
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,890
>> That was my intent
in my meditation.

468
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,058
>> When you were in church,
still with the church?

469
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:45,767
>> Yes.
>> OK.

470
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,729
The, the spirits was what
their church was involved with.

471
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,647
That was the whole focal
point of their church,

472
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,442
was to communicate with
people who had died to give

473
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,068
proof of afterlife.

474
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,861
>> I see.

475
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,404
>> And that was important to me.

476
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,282
And I thought that wasn't the
only intent for meditation.

477
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,116
>> Right.

478
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:05,662
>> My meditation came because,
like drugs helped pull me out

479
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,499
of pain and suffering, this new
excitement I found whenever I

480
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,836
would start to go down and
start to feel a little cruddy

481
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,589
or start getting back in
those low points again,

482
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,257
I would use meditation.

483
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,052
And it brought me to a new level
of feeling good, and excited,

484
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,637
and clear.

485
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,183
And I used it like I used to
use drugs, several times a day,

486
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,809
as much as I could.

487
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,604
The quantity, the quality
was important to me.

488
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,065
So I kept using
meditation as a tool

489
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,193
to help alleviate all
that stress and stuff.

490
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,530
So that coupled with
that contact of people

491
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,657
who had passed on.

492
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,868
Those were the real focus
points of my meditation.

493
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,037
And the Hemi-Sync took
me above and beyond that.

494
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,914
>> And can you describe
how it did that?

495
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,999
Or is that something you
have to buy the Hemi-Sync

496
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,833
and go through?

497
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,918
Is there--

498
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,753
>> It's a several step process.

499
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,924
So the teachings are
just tools to use.

500
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,136
And the vibration sounds,
basically, they sync up

501
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,805
your hemispheres of the brain.

502
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,597
>> OK.

503
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,475
Yeah, because binaural
beats and Hemi-Sync,

504
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,978
it's based on the same
concept of different tones

505
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,895
in different ears.

506
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,354
>> Yes.

507
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,146
Exactly.

508
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,233
And some of them,
and not Hemi-Sync.

509
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,192
I used other ones.

510
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
But Hemi-Sync was the one
that gave me technique.

511
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,862
Those teach you techniques.

512
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,113
>> Right.

513
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,823
>> They teach you
healing, out-of-body,

514
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,242
communication with
spirit, all of those.

515
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,496
And with those, I was
able to jump through.

516
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,791
Now, the experiences themselves
were so vast, and different

517
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,127
kinds of experiences.

518
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,629
The first day I started, there
was a vibration in my body

519
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,423
I never felt before.

520
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,133
It made my whole body [BUZZING].

521
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,011
And the chakras were
just high vibrational.

522
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,846
And those types of
experiences were

523
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,055
what hooked me in right away.

524
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:47,889
>> Wow.

525
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,433
>> I was skeptical,
to say the least.

526
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,476
So I started with
my first one saying,

527
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,686
well, we'll see what it does.

528
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,895
And the first one was a hit.

529
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,938
So I just kept going.

530
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,772
>> Wow.

531
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,691
>> The experience itself--

532
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,444
normally, I suggest to people,
if you do the Hemi-Sync,

533
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,487
go through it at your own pace.

534
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,990
But I would suggest no
less than six months,

535
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,826
no less than a year
to go through all six.

536
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,745
For me, I jumped through
them in four months.

537
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,537
>> Wow.

538
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,581
>> And I thought it
was way too quick.

539
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,291
But everything
happens for a reason.

540
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,083
>> Right.

541
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,544
>> And it worked out well.

542
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,756
>> So that led you into
the channeling state?

543
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,050
Or did you get to talk
to spirits, I should say?

544
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,178
>> I never got real contact with
spirits in the way I wanted to.

545
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:26,970
>> OK.

546
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,973
>> But my belief system then
was I should be hearing them

547
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,893
in my ears, like
audioclairancy or something.

548
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,394
And that should
be the experience.

549
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,148
But I had gotten
pictures or ideas.

550
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,193
And that really never happened
in the Gateway Experience.

551
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,944
There were times
where I was able--

552
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,738
>> Gateway is the church, or no?

553
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,156
>> No, Gateway
was the Hemi-Sync.

554
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,948
>> Oh, OK.

555
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,078
>> That part really never gave
me any kind of spirit contact.

556
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,372
Although, I do know
that I was connecting

557
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,664
to different energies.

558
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,418
Maybe not aware in the
moment, questioning that.

559
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,337
And that was something
the church had helped me

560
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,923
with before, to stop
questioning myself,

561
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,051
because that's a big, big part
of tapping into your intuition.

562
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,719
>> Right.

563
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,804
>> So I go through these.

564
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,056
And I get all sorts
of experiences,

565
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,600
out-of-body experiences,
not controlled.

566
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,061
And I still-- to this
day, I can astral project,

567
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,396
but I can't tell
myself where to go.

568
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,273
I can't say, I want
to go down the street

569
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,484
and hang out in the
bar in spirit form.

570
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
I can't do that.

571
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,361
>> Oh, I see.

572
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,154
But you can shoot
out of your body.

573
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:26,947
>> Oh, yeah.

574
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,948
>> And then it just kind of--

575
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,741
>> Every time I
connect in channeling,

576
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
that's what I'm doing.

577
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,661
>> And then you just--
it just floats around,

578
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,038
and you're just kind of
observing whatever appears

579
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,123
to you?
Or how does that--

580
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,166
>> Well, I've had
experiences like that.

581
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,545
But most of time, it's like
an experience going out

582
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,296
into a different
environment altogether.

583
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,631
I've experienced other planets.

584
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:49,302
I've experienced other parts of
reality here, different times.

585
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,264
But how I connected
to TReb was different.

586
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,391
I had not had an
out-of-body that

587
00:23:54,391 --> 00:24:00,272
was severely powerful or very,
very deep in meaning to me.

588
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,525
And I had a real messed
up night that night.

589
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,153
I watched the Hubble
Deep space thing

590
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,738
for the first time, the 3D
one that they had on YouTube.

591
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,531
>> Oh, yeah.

592
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,701
>> And it touched my heart, but
it kind of made me feel empty,

593
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,369
like I can't go out there.

594
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,246
I can't be a part of that.

595
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,582
And it really kind of made
me depressed a little.

596
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,251
So I used a meditation.

597
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,796
In the Hemi-Sync, they go
through steps 1 through 21.

598
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,049
And I decided one night, well,
why don't I just go past 21.

599
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,093
And that was that
night of depression.

600
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,261
And that's when I met TReb.

601
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,597
And when I met TReb, it was--

602
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,726
>> Steps 1 through 21, and what
do you mean by going past 21?

603
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,728
Do they have actually
steps after 21?

604
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,312
>> No.
>> Oh.

605
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,730
>> They do 1 through 21.

606
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,316
And basically, when you're
meditating, you're counting.

607
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,525
It's a self-hypnosis.

608
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,985
That's what meditation is.

609
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,445
It's a self-hypnosis.

610
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,990
And each step that you
take, you go deeper in.

611
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,203
So step 1, you're starting
to feel less your body,

612
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,454
and then it goes on.

613
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,122
So I went past the 21.

614
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,291
And that's the maximum of
the Gateway Experience,

615
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,376
is the 21st--

616
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,753
They call it the 21 state.

617
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,587
>> What's at 21?

618
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,796
Can you reveal what's at 21?

619
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,841
>> Well, 21 state is
basically a full-blown conscious

620
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,592
integration.

621
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,135
You can connect with
your higher self.

622
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,470
You can leave your body.

623
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,014
At that point, you're at the
deepest level of consciousness

624
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:16,848
available.

625
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,059
>> And did you kind of in
your own mind then say OK,

626
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,227
we're going 22.

627
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,019
>> Yeah.

628
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,230
And I just-- and it
wasn't even a number.

629
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,272
I didn't go 22, 23.

630
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,106
>> Right.

631
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,816
>> I just went beyond.

632
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,360
Now, it's time to go beyond.

633
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,653
And I did it in the moment.

634
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,487
>> Through the veil.

635
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,239
>> Not deciding
before, in the moment,

636
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,740
and that's when I
connected to TReb,

637
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,532
right then.

638
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,367
>> Wow!

639
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,371
>> Now when I'm connecting to
TReb, this is very surreal.

640
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,206
It's very realistic.

641
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,416
It's just like me and you
sitting here talking today.

642
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,918
And that's the
first time I'd ever

643
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,503
left my body in such a fashion.

644
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,295
>> Wow.

645
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,632
>> Before when I left my body,
there would be tracers or sound

646
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,010
would be gone, or the images
were blurry, or vibrating.

647
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,847
It was always different,
but never this clear.

648
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,848
I was on a ship.

649
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,601
I know that much now, because
I've been back to those ships

650
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,394
before.

651
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,105
It was one of the Yit ships,
which is TReb's people.

652
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,525
And I was sitting there
in a room by myself.

653
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,902
And eventually, through
the door comes TReb.

654
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,698
And this, it scared
the shit out of me.

655
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,243
It was a horribly
menacing being that was--

656
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,412
you're looking up
to, 7 and 1/2 foot.

657
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,414
I'm sitting in this
chair, and I'm instantly

658
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,707
transported sitting in a chair.

659
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,586
I always joke, it's like a
futuristic space doctor waiting

660
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,296
room, because you're
just sitting there.

661
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,423
And there is a sign that
has this writing over here

662
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,465
to the right.

663
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,925
And it's not written in English.

664
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,261
But after looking at it
long enough, I could tell.

665
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,764
And it basically says something
to the effect: Just sit here,

666
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,725
and someone will be with
you soon, type thing.

667
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,892
And I laughed about that.

668
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,728
I still-- I don't
know if I made--

669
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,895
>> You interpreted it.

670
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,897
You interpreted it as sit here.

671
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,732
OK.

672
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,566
>> And I wait.

673
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,902
And this big gigantic
reptilian, blue green,

674
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:57,324
gigantic teeth, huge purple
eyes, just comes through.

675
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,534
>> Now, I'll jump ahead
just for a second.

676
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,912
When I come back, I
think I am insane.

677
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,914
I think something's
wrong with me.

678
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,752
I think the Hemi-Sync gave me
a brain aneurysm, or something,

679
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,337
because this is not real.

680
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,005
>> It's a crazy
psychedelic experience.

681
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,339
>> Yeah.

682
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,214
>> Beyond psychedelic

683
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,634
>> Beyond anything you
could ingest, entheogens,

684
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,426
any of that.

685
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,260
>> Oh, wow.

686
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,473
>> The silver suit, he even wore
a silver robe and gold boots.

687
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,850
And I'm thinking to
myself, if I were trying

688
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,604
to pull out the cheesiest
space futuristic suit,

689
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,438
what would it be?

690
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,522
And that's it.

691
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,440
And that's what he was wearing.

692
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:30,815
>> Wow.

693
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,608
>> He comes to me.

694
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,901
And it's this gigantic thing.

695
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,110
And I'm scared.

696
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,738
And I felt my energy
tighten up like a ball.

697
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,699
And it was very scary for
only a couple of seconds.

698
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,159
And after that, it dissipated.

699
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,495
I felt this huge sense of love.

700
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,788
I was able to relax.

701
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:50,543
It was almost like--

702
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,629
I'm trying to think--

703
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,756
OK, it was almost
like a sedative

704
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,884
at the doctor, that just
relaxed the body and the mind.

705
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,927
And then he came in.

706
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,054
And he said that
he was connected

707
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,641
to me, that me and him were
connected and supposed to meet.

708
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,059
He told me a lot
of things that I

709
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,479
think I know about reality
aren't necessarily the way,

710
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,855
there's a lot more to it.

711
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,024
He explained different
levels of consciousness.

712
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,651
He explained
different dimensions.

713
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,569
He explained--
>> All this in this one meeting?

714
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,114
>> In the first meeting, and
the first time I ever talked

715
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,823
to him.
>> Wow.

716
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,865
>> And he didn't go detailed.

717
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,659
Now, I didn't have the
terminology either.

718
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,493
>> Right.

719
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,996
>> And the way telepathy
works is that when--

720
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,041
they're using your words
to try to convey a message.

721
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,711
And you don't necessarily
get words per se.

722
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,671
It's just kind of
a group thought.

723
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,256
All of this coming
to me at once.

724
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,718
And it was so overwhelming
and so powerful

725
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,720
that it was hard to
remember a lot of the things

726
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,097
that we talked about the
first couple of times.

727
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,808
But the first time, I remember
it like it was yesterday.

728
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,309
It was so clear.

729
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,854
And he explains, it's
not what you think,

730
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,230
all these levels.

731
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,190
And he said, I'm here.

732
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,066
I'm here for you.

733
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,152
If you want to connect
to me, I'm here.

734
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:57,986
And I left.

735
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,530
And now, at this time, when
I started the Hemi-Sync,

736
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
I was full-blast.

737
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:06,494
I'm three times a day meditation
for an hour, an hour 25 each.

738
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,582
Plus using closed-eye technique,
where I'm just turning sounds

739
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,668
into vibrations and energy,
and understanding that.

740
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,380
It's kind of a self-taught
technique that I taught myself.

741
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,384
>> Basically, after learning
these meditations I would

742
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,803
utilize, I was
hooked on meditation.

743
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,599
And in my mind, to miss
a day of meditation

744
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,185
is like missing
breathing oxygen.

745
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:34,230
But after that, it was
so intense and so odd,

746
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,692
I skipped meditating for over
four days before I reconnected.

747
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,860
>> After the TReb experience.

748
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,694
>> Yes.

749
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:44,407
And after that point, I
was hesitant to go back.

750
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,951
And I questioned myself
more than I did just

751
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,994
about any time in my life.

752
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,329
Even more than the--

753
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,580
>> Questioning your sanity.

754
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,375
>> Yes, my sanity, everything.

755
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,753
I had talked to my ex-wife,

756
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,588
she was my wife then, about it.

757
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,674
And she said, this meditation
is doing something to you

758
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,509
probably.

759
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,053
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

760
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:05,970
You seem lucid.

761
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,472
You seem OK.

762
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,515
So finally I...

763
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,100
>> And the rest of your life was
getting better at this point,

764
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,435
because of the meditations?

765
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,603
>> Oh, yes, yes.

766
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,189
By this time, I had already
spent several months

767
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,317
with the church, several months
after the church meditating.

768
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,236
So my life was really
getting smooth again.

769
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:25,490
>> And relationships, and
your son, and your viewpoint,

770
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,825
and all that was getting better?

771
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,325
>> Yes.

772
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,576
It was getting a lot
better at that point.

773
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,076
>> OK.

774
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,955
So you knew the meditations were
working, not in a negative way,

775
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,248
but in a positive way.

776
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:33,748
>> Sure.

777
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,541
Sure.

778
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,417
And it became so
much a part of me.

779
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,171
I hated to miss those four
days, but I was just so,

780
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:45,218
so questioning myself, and if
I should keep going with this.

781
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,221
And it was a big question
mark at that point.

782
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,265
But the question remained.

783
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,432
Can I do this again?

784
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,350
Can I meet this being?

785
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,810
Can I ask him questions?

786
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,479
Because I really didn't get a
lot of chance to talk and ask

787
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,313
questions.

788
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,816
It was more of him saying,
hey, this, this, and this.

789
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,608
>> Right.

790
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,652
>> Are your ears open?

791
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,404
Yes, they are open now.

792
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,699
So I go back, and I meditate.

793
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,200
>> You go through the 21 cycle.

794
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,617
>> Yes,
and I go past them.

795
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,535
>> Now the 22 cycles.

796
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,119
>> Yes.

797
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,996
>> So now you know how to
get there through this--

798
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,997
>> Easily now.

799
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,499
>> Through this process.

800
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,333
>> Yes.

801
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,920
And the part of me
that was hesitant

802
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,255
said, I'm just going to do it.

803
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,798
And I went past.

804
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,301
I reconnected to him two
or three times after that,

805
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,969
just basic conversations.

806
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,387
Who are you?

807
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,431
>> And it was just as
visceral as the first one?

808
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,265
>> Yes.

809
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,057
>> Each time?

810
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,144
>> Each one just as vividly
as the last, just as real,

811
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,187
just as strong.

812
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,731
Each time it got
a little easier.

813
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,316
But about the fourth
or fifth time--

814
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,360
>> It got easier to get there,
or just the whole experience?

815
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,280
>> On my own sanity, on
my questioning myself,

816
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,197
it got a little easier.

817
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,407
>> I see.
I see.

818
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,700
>> It wasn't so jolting.

819
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,743
>> Right.

820
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,535
OK.

821
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,997
>> And it was jolting the
first time, the second, third.

822
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,206
I go, and I--

823
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,792
the fourth, fifth time
I go, and I ask him,

824
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,127
how do I know you're real?

825
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,546
How do I know I'm
not going crazy?

826
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,466
How do I know something's
not wrong with my mind?

827
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,343
And he said, talk
to your friend.

828
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,303
And this is the same
friend who I grew up with,

829
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,347
the same friend, Scott,
a dear friend of mine

830
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,389
since we were kids.

831
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,223
>> Right.

832
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,267
>> How do I know you're real?

833
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,644
He said, go talk to Scott.

834
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,896
And when you do, don't
tell him about me,

835
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,106
just talk to him as your friend.

836
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,234
And there should be something
in there that will help you.

837
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,195
And I go, OK.

838
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,031
No later than a day, my friend
gets a hold of me, and says:

839
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,450
Hey, I've got this really
cool UFO documentary

840
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,242
I've been watching.

841
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,577
It's really amazing.

842
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,121
He sends me the link
to it, and I watch it.

843
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,499
And on that documentary,
they started

844
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,334
talking about channeling.

845
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,251
Now--

846
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,920
>> So you didn't know
about channeling.

847
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,254
>> Nothing about channeling.

848
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,548
I knew about mediumship
from the church.

849
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,383
>> Right.

850
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,884
>> That's what their
whole deal was,

851
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,012
but I never heard
the term channeling.

852
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,139
And although I had
seen it in the church--

853
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,350
people getting messages
directly through them--

854
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,726
I never knew
exactly what it was.

855
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,519
>> I see.

856
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,980
>> I just thought that was
that medium's way of bringing

857
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
in the information.

858
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,981
>> Sure.

859
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,608
>> So I watch it.

860
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,236
And there's-- only out of
the whole hour and a half

861
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,154
documentary, it's like
a five-minute clip.

862
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,366
And out of that, they
talk about the Law of One,

863
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,786
which was an ET
contact channeling

864
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,455
from the '80s, the "Law
of One, Ra Material."

865
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,289
>> OK.

866
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,125
>> Carla Rueckert and the crew.

867
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,670
And during that time,
they mentioned that.

868
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,756
And I'm sitting
there in excitement,

869
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,259
but not really
knowing anything more

870
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,261
about what I should
be listening for.

871
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:37,390
And right at the end of it, this
guy says: This, in my opinion,

872
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,851
is the greatest
channeling out there,

873
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,855
second only to Jane Roberts
and the "Seth Material."

874
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,772
One sentence.

875
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,858
That sentence grabbed me
more than the other five

876
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,859
minutes of talking.

877
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
>> Right.
>> So that's what I checked out.

878
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,571
And now looking
back, I know why,

879
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,949
because the "Ra Material"
was pretty far out there

880
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,036
comparatively. The "Seth
Material" was more mainstream.

881
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,163
It was more about
consciousness and evolution

882
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,082
of the soul, which was what
TReb had talked to me about.

883
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,292
So I locked into that.

884
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,836
I looked it up, got
all the audio clips,

885
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,463
downloaded the PDF.

886
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,922
All of these things online.

887
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,799
>> From "Seth" and "Ra,"
or just the "Seth?"

888
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,884
>> Just the "Seth."

889
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,928
The "Ra Material" was still
out of my scope, off my radar.

890
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,681
>> Even though you've
seen a big purple-eyed--

891
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,474
>> Yes.

892
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,811
You would think that the
rest would be OK, right?

893
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,354
And I never looked
at it that way.

894
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,106
But I always know
there was a reason.

895
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:27,940
>> OK.

896
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,527
>> And when I dug in, I
found out what it was.

897
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,404
Seth was saying the
same thing that TReb

898
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,324
said, just in different terms
and different terminology.

899
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,159
And some of these
terms were new to me.

900
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,496
And I had to really
kind of focus.

901
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,748
Some of the words, I had no
idea what they even meant,

902
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,167
but I would go
through, and I studied.

903
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,711
And what it was,
I am not a reader.

904
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,504
I don't read.

905
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,798
I listen, like audio
books are my thing.

906
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,590
>> Same way.

907
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,925
I'm the same way.

908
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,134
>> It's a cognitive thing.

909
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,805
>> I've been audio-listening
to your book.

910
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,847
>> Nice.

911
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,308
>> I have it in the PDF format,
and I have it on my iPhone.

912
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,603
It's a process, but
still, I can go through it

913
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,188
much faster by listening to it.

914
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,731
>> Oh, nice.

915
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,274
I need a program like that too.

916
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,277
It's helpful, to say the least.

917
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,530
That's how I retain
that information.

918
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,406
So I find this one little clip.

919
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,619
It's like an hour
and 50 minutes.

920
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,830
And it's excerpts of
"Seth Speaks, the Eternal

921
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,872
Validity of the Soul."

922
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,707
>> It's the clip on YouTube?

923
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,418
>> There's one on YouTube, and
there was one downloadable one

924
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,421
that just had the excerpts
from this guy who enjoyed that,

925
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,214
he read,

926
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,383
and it was professionally done.

927
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:40,054
And I listened to it, and it
changed my whole perspective

928
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,097
on a lot of stuff.

929
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,723
And it was so powerful
and so resonant

930
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,017
with what TReb had
already said to me.

931
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,521
And when I heard
that, it reconfirmed

932
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,607
that maybe I wasn't making
this stuff up in my head.

933
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,567
>> Right.

934
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,695
>> And this is something I
never have said publicly before,

935
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,573
but in that four-day period
where I stayed away from

936
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,449
the meditation and
didn't go back to TReb,

937
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,161
I actually went to the
emergency room and said,

938
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,663
I had this experience.

939
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,123
I might be going crazy.

940
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,040
>> What did they say?

941
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,000
>> The doctor was cool.

942
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,295
He's like, you're playing around
with those binaural beats.

943
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,672
He goes, meditation,
sometimes you

944
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,424
go into a lot of
subconscious places.

945
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,968
He said, you probably just had
some kind of weird experience.

946
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,553
He said, I wouldn't worry about.

947
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,637
>> Oh, OK.

948
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,055
>> Which gave me relief.

949
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,474
>> But you go like open the
emergency doors, and say,

950
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:31,063
I've seen a green,
seven-foot tall, blue eyes.

951
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,231
It's real.

952
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,234
Gold boots, silver robe.

953
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,778
>> They would have locked me up.

954
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,780
>> So you didn't go in
that dramatic, that big.

955
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,574
>> No, very lightly.

956
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,451
>> You just signed
the documents--

957
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,494
>> What are you here for?

958
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,040
I had an experience I
need to talk to you about.

959
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,082
It was very nice though.

960
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:50,875
He was cool.

961
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,500
>> All right.

962
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,585
>> If it would have been
a different doctor--

963
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,921
>> He didn't give you a
shot and strap you to a bed,

964
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,547
and hook you up to
a bunch of machines.

965
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,049
>> I'm sure if I
had another doctor.

966
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,217
>> Yeah, if you got that
wrong doctor, you probably--

967
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,636
>> I would have
been there, yeah.

968
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,472
And it's amazing to see how
the mainstream thinks about it.

969
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,306
>> True.

970
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,434
>> But I lucked out, really.

971
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,395
It wasn't luck, but
you know what I mean.

972
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,897
I get done with that.

973
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,024
And I have those experiences.

974
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,692
And from there, it
just kept going.

975
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:22,949
Now, most people who have heard
TReb or Aridif on the radio

976
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,994
or on YouTube, they might not
know the whole story about it.

977
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,872
I worked with TReb for two
years in meditative state

978
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,248
before I ever channeled.

979
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,876
I really had no
interest to channel.

980
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,836
At the end of the two
years, I felt like I

981
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,421
had learned all I could learn.

982
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,675
Of course, being the
human ego, I was like,

983
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,717
I know everything now.

984
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,677
>> I know the universe.

985
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,511
>> Yeah.

986
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,846
>> It's like Keanu
Reeves in the Matrix.

987
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,889
He's like, I know Kung Fu.

988
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,723
>> Yeah.

989
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,516
Instantly.

990
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,850
Yeah, that was beautiful.

991
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:54,063
>> But so after two years,
though, you're like, yeah.

992
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,481
>> I know what I can know.

993
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,900
And I wanted to find out
how to teach it to people.

994
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,734
>> Right.

995
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,195
>> I thought I was ready
to teach people, and I was.

996
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,491
So I knew that it was
possible to channel.

997
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,618
I'd seen Jane Roberts do it.

998
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,746
And by that point, I had
looked up Darryl Anka.

999
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,540
I had heard of Kryon,
even though I never

1000
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,043
checked out a lot of
that work at that point.

1001
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,045
And I'd seen just
a very few others.

1002
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,256
Back when I started doing this--

1003
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,008
>> Esther Hicks
and Abraham Hicks.

1004
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,427
>> I'd never even heard
of her until I met Kalina.

1005
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,887
Kalina is the one who's like,
have you ever heard of-- who?

1006
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,056
And she's like you
really are a channeler.

1007
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,516
Because so many
channelers are so

1008
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,643
oblivious of other
spiritual teachers,

1009
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,311
just because they're
in their own groove.

1010
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,230
>> I just did another interview.

1011
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,691
And they-- she was saying
the exact same thing.

1012
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,318
I was like bringing
up all these names.

1013
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,777
She was like, ah, I don't know.

1014
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,196
The name sounds
familiar, but purposely,

1015
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,115
I don't go and see
that stuff, because I

1016
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,285
don't want to plagiarize
or say anything that--

1017
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,037
I don't want anybody
to think that I'm

1018
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,455
copying their material.

1019
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,749
>> Well, that was a
concern of mine, too.

1020
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,667
When I started to
jump ahead a little,

1021
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,211
when I started channeling,
I cut myself off

1022
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,130
from all other channel material.

1023
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,173
I said, I want--

1024
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,133
and this was for me,
not for anyone else--

1025
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,802
I want to know what's coming
through is legitimate.

1026
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,056
I had huge filter
issues in the beginning.

1027
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,974
But to jump back,
I work with TReb.

1028
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,267
I told him, I want to channel.

1029
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,351
I want to share this.

1030
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,645
But I want you to be
there for the answers,

1031
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:21,025
because there's still stuff
I'm probably not sure of.

1032
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,569
And if there is, you
need to be there.

1033
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,572
The channeling idea was cool
to me, and we worked with it.

1034
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,242
>> So when you said you want--

1035
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,371
you asked him to be there, but
in essence, channeling, you're

1036
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,581
asking him to come through.

1037
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,165
>> Yeah.

1038
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:36,957
>> OK.

1039
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,877
You had that conversation with
him in this meditative state,

1040
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,756
which again, I'm assuming
is still as visceral as ever.

1041
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,548
>> Yes.

1042
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,341
>> It's still like--

1043
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,218
>> Never a time was dull.

1044
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,385
>> OK.

1045
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:52,223
So it all felt just like we're
having a conversation just now.

1046
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,974
Only you're on a
ship always, or--

1047
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:54,809
>> No.

1048
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,268
We were everywhere
at that point.

1049
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,436
The first time was a ship.

1050
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,398
And after that, most, like
I'd say probably 75% or more

1051
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,067
of the time, I'm with
him on his planet,

1052
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,985
just different
parts of the planet.

1053
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,738
But yeah, I've been
everywhere with him.

1054
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,449
>> Well, I know I don't want
to get out of order here,

1055
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,826
but what's his planet like?

1056
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,243
What is that like?

1057
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,160
>> Oh, it's beautiful.

1058
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,245
It's gorgeous.

1059
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,372
When you're looking
up at the sky,

1060
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,165
it's a beautiful,
beautiful purple sky.

1061
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:18,999
>> Purple sky?

1062
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,669
>> It's hard to explain, too,
because the shade of purple it

1063
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,296
is, there really isn't a shade
of purple I found to show

1064
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,841
people, like this is the purple.

1065
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,342
But they have tons
of red plants.

1066
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,135
>> Red plants?

1067
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,594
>> Very beautiful green water.

1068
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,387
It's gorgeous.

1069
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,096
>> Green water?

1070
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:32,680
>> Yeah.

1071
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,514
OK.

1072
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,015
So we're talking.

1073
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,225
Are all the plants red?

1074
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,935
Do they have green plants?

1075
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,811
>> Oh, no, no.

1076
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,604
It's all red, just
different shades of red.

1077
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,565
There are a couple ones
that are different,

1078
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,984
like so different in red,
they're almost not red,

1079
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,318
like yellows.

1080
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,280
And a couple of them
are purple, but not--

1081
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,406
it's like a red-purple.

1082
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:51,365
It's all shaded red.

1083
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,451
And I don't know if that
has to do with their star,

1084
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,452
or if it has to do
with the actual plants

1085
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:56,495
the way I can perceive it.

1086
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,330
>> What about their
dirt and the ground?

1087
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,165
What is that like?

1088
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,166
>> I've never seen it.

1089
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,375
It's all covered with stuff.

1090
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,419
>> It's covered with red leaves.

1091
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,295
>> Yeah.

1092
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,754
Well, just like grass.

1093
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,214
There's a different
kind of grass.

1094
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,591
It's more fluffy.

1095
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,800
It's like--

1096
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,385
>> Moss?

1097
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,762
>> Not like moss, more--

1098
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,098
it's-- I can't think
of the plant's name.

1099
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,268
It's stuff that people eat.

1100
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,647
It's like a mix of kale
and a dandelion, I think.

1101
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,357
It's hard to explain.

1102
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,358
>> Kale and a dandelion.

1103
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,360
>> It's fluffy, and it's leafy.

1104
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,153
>> Not wheatgrass.

1105
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,112
>> It might be.

1106
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,822
I'm not versed on the--

1107
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,074
>> On the whole
health food stuff.

1108
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:34,867
>> Yes.

1109
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,659
Not yet.

1110
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,660
I'm working on that.

1111
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,453
>> All right.

1112
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:38,287
Interesting.

1113
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,747
>> But it's all over the ground.

1114
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,999
So you don't see exposed ground.

1115
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,209
And I never went digging.

1116
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,168
Every time I'm there--

1117
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,377
>> Sprouts.

1118
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,503
>> Yeah, sprouts.

1119
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,296
That's a good one.

1120
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:47,838
Yeah.

1121
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,422
I like that.

1122
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,381
It's kind of like that.

1123
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,925
Yeah, but leafy,
a little leafier.

1124
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
>> All right.
OK.

1125
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,302
>> Yeah.

1126
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,720
>> Wow.

1127
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,222
It's fascinating,
because I've never

1128
00:41:56,222 --> 00:42:01,185
heard like this, like
you were in that world,

1129
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,397
so visceral, and so real.

1130
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,399
I didn't understand that's--

1131
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,069
I think before we were joking
at the seminar you went fishing

1132
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,861
with TReb.

1133
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,822
But I'd never thought it
was actually going fishing,

1134
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,907
like we're here at a lake.

1135
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,449
>> Yeah.

1136
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,992
>> It's that real
that you could go--

1137
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,619
>> That real.

1138
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,912
>> I wonder what kind of fish?

1139
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,996
Did you ever see any fish?

1140
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,789
>> No.

1141
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,541
They do have
underwater life there.

1142
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,210
They have big, big lizards too.

1143
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,128
Go figure.

1144
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,422
There are these gigantic--

1145
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,258
I'd say probably
about six-foot long.

1146
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,343
>> Like iguanas?

1147
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,679
>> They're more-- they're
actually very similar,

1148
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,723
TReb said, to their third
den-- or the second density,

1149
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,310
their second density life,
which is, they kind of look like

1150
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,105
Komodo dragons,
but more upright.

1151
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,691
They're really long, really
big, very thick scaling.

1152
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,735
They have the same color
skin as TReb's race,

1153
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,445
different shades darker though.

1154
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,072
More towards like a
forest green-blue,

1155
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,115
if that makes sense.

1156
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,157
>> And you've seen these?

1157
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:57,491
>> Yeah.

1158
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,659
I've seen those.

1159
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,162
Those are-- the major life
on their planet are those.

1160
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,205
>> Birds at all?

1161
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,665
>> Yeah, they've
got flying things.

1162
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,834
They've got little
flying things that--

1163
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,252
they don't look
like birds, though.

1164
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,920
They look almost like--

1165
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,838
>> Dinosaurish?

1166
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,630
Pterodactyls?

1167
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,799
>> No, they're actually
very mammal-looking.

1168
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,050
>> Oh, mammal-looking?

1169
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,843
>> Yeah.

1170
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,094
They're the only things on the--

1171
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,511
>> Bats?

1172
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,929
>> Not like a bat, either.

1173
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,139
They have wings.

1174
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,725
They fly, but they're real boxy.

1175
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,559
>> Boxy.

1176
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,393
What do you mean by boxy?

1177
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,185
>> Squared.

1178
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,479
They're very squared
in their features.

1179
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,314
>> Interesting.

1180
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,106
>> Yeah.
>> Wow.

1181
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:29,773
>> It's different.

1182
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,524
>> This is fascinating.

1183
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,276
I feel like we don't
even need to channel.

1184
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,779
We can just talk all
day about this world.

1185
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,824
>> There's been some worlds
that I've seen too before.

1186
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,328
I have talked to people,
like CGI artists, and said,

1187
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,496
I want to describe this
to you and make it,

1188
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,748
but it's such a process.

1189
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,750
And nobody has an
interest in doing it,

1190
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,295
unless there's money
involved with it.

1191
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,797
The few people who've
done artwork for us

1192
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,593
usually do the entities that I
channel, like TReb or Aridif.

1193
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,887
Vashta does those, and Eduardo.

1194
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,807
>> Do you think then
when CGI artists--

1195
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,601
I used to run a visual
effects company,

1196
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,854
so I know some of these
model makers come out

1197
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,481
with these fascinating designs--

1198
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,066
do you think they're
actually tapping

1199
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,111
into some alternate planetary
consciousness out there

1200
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,906
as opposed to it being
originally created,

1201
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:24,119
or maybe pieces of different
planetary consciousnesses?

1202
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,039
>> I guarantee they're
channeling 90% or more of it.

1203
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,415
>> Oh, wow.

1204
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,461
>> They're even-- and it's
something like it's a conundrum

1205
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,589
where is it that
everything exists,

1206
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,508
or is it that this
universe is so big,

1207
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,343
that it has to exist somewhere?

1208
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,221
Or is it just whatever
you think, you create?

1209
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,390
It doesn't really matter,
because what they're doing

1210
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,182
is real.

1211
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,226
I've seen some of the
special effects stuff

1212
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,144
that people have done in
movies or video games.

1213
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,604
And it's like,
I've seen something

1214
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,607
almost exactly like that,
or something very similar.

1215
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,110
Enough where you couldn't
notice the difference to someone

1216
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,444
who doesn't live there.

1217
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,445
>> Right.
Wow.

1218
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,531
>> So it's truly inspiration.

1219
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,492
That imagination part of
us is us tapping into that.

1220
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,284
>> Yeah.

1221
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,744
Fascinating.

1222
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,540
So you spend two years
going to this world,

1223
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,458
having these conversations.

1224
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,838
And it's your idea then
to finally talk to TReb

1225
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,465
and say, hey, why don't we try
this whole channeling thing?

1226
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,007
>> Yeah.

1227
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:19,758
>> And what does he say?

1228
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,717
Of course, I'm sure.

1229
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,093
>> Yeah.

1230
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,136
He said, yeah.

1231
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,680
That's one of the
paths we can take.

1232
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
>> Awesome.

1233
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,269
And did he give you
tips on how to do it?

1234
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,647
Or were you, by this time,
versed enough to say,

1235
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,274
OK, this is what
we've got to do, TReb.

1236
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,108
How did that work?

1237
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,445
>> No, it's actually a
combination of the two.

1238
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,574
And it was never me going,
hey, I think this will work.

1239
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,742
I went out on the internet.

1240
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,452
Obviously, the
internet was great.

1241
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,953
There wasn't a lot
of stuff there.

1242
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,165
So I searched out
psychic mediums.

1243
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:55,252
I knew a guy who worked with
the team of the "Law of One"

1244
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,173
material, that after the "Law
Of One" material was written,

1245
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,717
he worked closely with
the main channeler there,

1246
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,968
Carla Rueckert.

1247
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,762
So I worked with him
and talked to him.

1248
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,140
And he gave me a lot of
really great information.

1249
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,601
I had looked up online a
couple of channeling books.

1250
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,644
And now I realize,
probably, some

1251
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,439
of the same people
that I'm aware of today

1252
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,232
and just didn't know
was them back then.

1253
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,025
>> Right.

1254
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,026
>> And worked with TReb.

1255
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,777
And TReb helped
me out with a lot.

1256
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,989
And then I just kind of borrowed
a little from everything

1257
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,365
until it was perfect.

1258
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,201
And then I found my own mix.

1259
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,788
It was a garden variety of
a little bit of everything.

1260
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,789
>> What got you through?

1261
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,166
What was the catalyst
to bring TReb through?

1262
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,418
What was your first channeling
experience, I guess?

1263
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:41,465
>> Well, my first channeling
experience, I set up a camera.

1264
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,594
My then wife was there to
kind of monitor me and make

1265
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,596
sure nothing went too crazy.

1266
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,306
That was a concern of mine.

1267
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,350
I got this entity
coming in my body.

1268
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,686
I don't want to
lose control or--

1269
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,522
you know, the Christian
part of my mind...

1270
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,440
>> Hulk out!

1271
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,859
You have this big green
alien coming through you,

1272
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,905
you might. Did that
ever go through you mind?

1273
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,281
>> A little bit of that.

1274
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,115
>> OK.

1275
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,784
>> At that point,
I trusted TReb.

1276
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,995
I'd come to love him
like a dear friend.

1277
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,956
But there's still the unknown.

1278
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,668
Why would this entity come and
choose me out of everybody?

1279
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,253
Why?

1280
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,964
My Christian beliefs tapped
on my shoulder a few times.

1281
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,590
So I wanted to be careful.

1282
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,550
I wanted to be good.

1283
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,595
I recorded myself, and it
was amazingly horrible.

1284
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,888
>> Amazingly horrible.

1285
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,139
>> Yes.

1286
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:31,974
>> OK.

1287
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,475
Can you describe
amazingly horrible?

1288
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,560
>> Yes.

1289
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,478
The voice that
people hear TReb now,

1290
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,023
even if they go back four
years, it's not the same.

1291
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,233
It's a little different.

1292
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:48,532
And the accent's the same, the
type of talking that he uses.

1293
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,576
But the inflections
are different.

1294
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,661
And the yeses are
much more vibrant.

1295
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,581
And like when he says,
yes-- that "ye-e-e-s",

1296
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,249
really excited-- that
wasn't there then.

1297
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,713
It was very flat and monotone,
and kind of filtery too.

1298
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,880
There was just--

1299
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,216
I could tell all of
TReb wasn't getting in.

1300
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,303
So I practiced a few more times.

1301
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,347
But when you get to know
me, you know about me,

1302
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,765
I don't wait for anything.

1303
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,434
I don't wait till
everything's perfect.

1304
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,104
I just jump headfirst, fly
by the seat of my pants.

1305
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,399
So I immediately went
to the YouTube waves.

1306
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,984
I want to share this.

1307
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,988
And my first channeling
was actually a lot better.

1308
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,073
In the couple of times I
had tried between then,

1309
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,826
I probably only did
maybe 6 to 10 channelings

1310
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:36,288
between the first one and
the one I put on YouTube.

1311
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,668
>> And when you describe
6 to 10 channelings,

1312
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,087
or six channelings
or so before you--

1313
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,174
and you're recording yourself,
are you asking questions?

1314
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,342
Is it just you in the room?

1315
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,010
I mean, how do you--

1316
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,553
is there somebody else?

1317
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,181
Well, you said your wife-- is
she there to help facilitate?

1318
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,223
>> Yes.

1319
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,517
At that point, the
first couple ones

1320
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,978
was just letting TReb talk.

1321
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,647
I told him, you
just come through

1322
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,190
and say what you want to say.

1323
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,441
I'll share something.

1324
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,360
If it's usable, we
can put it on YouTube.

1325
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,736
So address people.

1326
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,279
And that's the first
couple of times.

1327
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,284
And then after that, my then
wife would ask a few questions.

1328
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,203
I let one of my friends try.

1329
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,288
So it was basically trial
and error, just playing

1330
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,874
around the first time.

1331
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:28,715
>> So I guess the
information was still good.

1332
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,926
It was just-- you say
when it was horrible,

1333
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,594
it wasn't the
information was horrible.

1334
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,387
>> Right.

1335
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,346
>> OK.

1336
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,641
>> And some of the information
came through a little odd,

1337
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,978
just the verbiage
on it was weird.

1338
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,772
You could tell it
was like having

1339
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,733
someone who first learned how to
speak English be able to talk.

1340
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,567
>> Right.

1341
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,360
OK.

1342
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,779
Well, that's what
I was wondering.

1343
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,989
And maybe this is a
question for TReb later.

1344
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,241
Does he have to learn English?

1345
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:59,788
Or is it all translated by you
via vibrational translations,

1346
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,331
vibrational frequencies?

1347
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,085
>> My best understanding
is that, basically--

1348
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,588
like when I go to channel,
I'm using the same techniques

1349
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,590
in a quicker way
than I used to when

1350
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,926
I would leave my physical body.

1351
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,303
So I'm leaving, and
part of TReb comes in.

1352
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,140
So when he's in, he's
mixing his energy with mine.

1353
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,059
So it's running through
my chakra systems,

1354
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,562
but also accessing
the brain part.

1355
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,481
And in that brain part is
the whole English language,

1356
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,027
my experiences, all
of my personality.

1357
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,279
So he has the opportunity
to access that.

1358
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,574
So English, it wasn't
that the English was bad,

1359
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,826
because he knew English
by knowing my mind.

1360
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,911
It was the way of
trying to express it.

1361
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,289
Like Aridif and TReb,
still to this day,

1362
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,875
sometimes they might get hung
up on a word, so they'll stop.

1363
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,667
>> Right.

1364
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,211
>> And they'll search
for the word or find one

1365
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,047
that's as compatible
as they can.

1366
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:55,510
So sometimes when-- like the one
that's most known, Aridif, when

1367
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,888
he says, you must do
this, he's not saying,

1368
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,222
you have to do this.

1369
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,850
He's saying, if you want
what you're desiring,

1370
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,726
this is the best way.

1371
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,518
>> Right

1372
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,811
>> So little things like that.

1373
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:09,232
But then it was much more
disproportional than it is now.

1374
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,025
>> I see.

1375
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,444
So it was more of a
translation glitch--

1376
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,278
>> Right.

1377
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:17,282
>> Than an actual understanding
of the language or knowing

1378
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,116
the language.

1379
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,118
It's not necessarily
what's happening.

1380
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,206
It's not like he went and had
to take a course in English 101.

1381
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,957
>> That would be rough.

1382
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:26,792
Yeah.

1383
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,627
But yeah, absolutely.

1384
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:33,298
It's a translational
vibrational thing.

1385
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,928
My vibration at the time,
it wasn't what it is now.

1386
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,513
I was learning all
this cool stuff,

1387
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,765
but I hadn't applied
very much of it.

1388
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,434
What I did learn
and applied helped.

1389
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,020
And it was really six months--

1390
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,688
>> In some way, you're
translating too.

1391
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,440
You have to raise your level.

1392
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,234
He has to bring his level down.

1393
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,237
So there has to
be this kind of--

1394
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,989
and then there's a growth,
I'm assuming, since then.

1395
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,699
Like you said,
it's gotten better.

1396
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:04,162
So you're able to meet
each other's frequencies.

1397
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,080
You're going up there,

1398
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,957
him coming down here.

1399
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,000
So that's evolved
over the years.

1400
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,126
>> Yes, absolutely.

1401
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,504
That's the perfect way,
too, to explain that.

1402
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:16,591
It's something where
it's amalgamation

1403
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,385
of two consciousnesses.

1404
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,428
And it's a concerted
effort on both

1405
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,389
of our parts to co-create that.

1406
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,598
And I couldn't get up to him.

1407
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,433
He could always come
down to me, but I just

1408
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,351
couldn't get up to him.

1409
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,188
And the more I channeled,
the more I felt his energy.

1410
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,982
And the more I felt
his energy, the easier

1411
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,944
it was for me to integrate
certain parts of the teachings.

1412
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,490
And in the teachings, a lot of
the stuff about self-creation,

1413
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,493
relaxing, the way
to perceive reality

1414
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,120
started clicking easier.

1415
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,956
So after the first six
months of channeling,

1416
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,000
I was 10 times better
than the first one.

1417
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,543
And in the first
year of channeling,

1418
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,295
I was 10 times better than that.

1419
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,379
And it kept going.

1420
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,632
And it's like any
job that any person

1421
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,135
does with their motor skills.

1422
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,928
Muscle memory comes into play.

1423
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,972
Well, this is energetic
muscle memory.

1424
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,390
And that's how it's applied.

1425
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,227
It's the more you do and repeat,
the better you are at it.

1426
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,855
And that's why even to this
day, I get better at channeling.

1427
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,647
>> I see.

1428
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:16,067
>> This time last year,
channeling was great.

1429
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,110
It was smooth.

1430
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,238
People resonated with it, but
now it's a whole new level.

1431
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,240
And this is why you
see the veterans

1432
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,534
out there who've channeled
their entire life;

1433
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,870
Darryl Anka, and
Nora, and Wendy.

1434
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,955
All those great
channelers, they've

1435
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,956
been doing that forever.

1436
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,833
It's their connection.

1437
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,668
TReb and Aridif actually
have a term for it.

1438
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,545
It's called building a bridge.

1439
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,213
And each time you
channel, you're

1440
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,967
putting a new peg in, or a new
screw, or a new plate of metal.

1441
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,469
And the bigger the
piece comes, it's

1442
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,263
the bigger realizations
you have in yourself.

1443
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,224
I had points in my channeling
where I didn't learn anything.

1444
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,228
Whenever I'd listen back
to a session, I was like,

1445
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,146
I already knew that.

1446
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,441
But when I started
really learning things

1447
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,068
about my own life
on my own terms,

1448
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,945
then it would shine
through on the channeling.

1449
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,198
And then it would open
up more synchronicities.

1450
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,492
And it wasn't that the
information wasn't new.

1451
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,827
It's just the way I
perceived it was old.

1452
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,665
So when I changed my
perceptions and my energy grew,

1453
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,125
that allowed that energy
to come in a lot better

1454
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,795
with understandings
and synchronicities

1455
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,088
to apply itself.

1456
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:21,049
>> So would that make the
channeling then better, better,

1457
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,510
more defined, or in a better--

1458
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,889
more terminology?

1459
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,517
Or because you were able to
have that perspective on it,

1460
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,227
did you think that
helped the channeling?

1461
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,478
>> Absolutely.

1462
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,854
And that was another thing.

1463
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:39,109
My English skills have zero.

1464
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,403
When I went through
school, I sucked at it.

1465
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,904
I could speak English.

1466
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,697
>> Just like me.

1467
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,489
>> Yeah.

1468
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,950
And it's not something
that I was great at.

1469
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,742
>> Right.

1470
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,745
>> But the more I cared
about how I talked,

1471
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,664
because I realized--

1472
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,583
and Kalina has been my
number one helper in that.

1473
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,420
Every time I throw a
word that doesn't exist

1474
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,588
or one that's mispronounced,
she helps me with that,

1475
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,800
because she knows, they need
that too to reflect back on.

1476
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,676
>> I see.

1477
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,136
>> But the more
energy I opened up,

1478
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,847
the more clarity came with
it, the easier it was for them

1479
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:13,101
to find the translation, not
only of energy, but words.

1480
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,227
>> Interesting.

1481
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,815
So TReb started coming in,

1482
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,858
and you're checking in.

1483
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,278
Are you still going and doing
your meditations with him

1484
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,572
at the same time
during this process?

1485
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,158
Or is the process of
channeling, is it the same

1486
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,201
as going into the meditations?

1487
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,121
Are you trance channeling,
I guess,

1488
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,457
in a sense where --
are you conscious

1489
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,834
of what's happening
during the channel?

1490
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,669
>> Now, it depends.

1491
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,965
There are three types of
channel states that I do.

1492
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,384
All of them are
trance channeling.

1493
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,678
The first and most
common occurrence

1494
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,347
is just like when
I visited TReb.

1495
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,557
I'm going to visit him.

1496
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,392
I'm there with him astrally.

1497
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:58,938
I perceive him in real-time,
just as real as we are.

1498
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,899
And that happens the most.

1499
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,401
And while I'm
channeling down here,

1500
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,195
not conscious of anything
that's being said,

1501
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,237
I'm hanging out with him.

1502
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,697
Going fishing with TReb.

1503
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,740
>> Right.
Right.

1504
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,367
>> And the second level
is the same thing.

1505
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,243
I'm out of my body.

1506
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,828
I'm experiencing something.

1507
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,873
But usually, it's something
that needs to be seen by me.

1508
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,666
And this can be a lot
of different things.

1509
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,877
TReb showed me time periods.

1510
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,921
He showed me different
planets, different animals,

1511
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,965
different vegetation,
just all sorts of stuff

1512
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:30,595
that at a later time comes in
for referencing that I need.

1513
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,306
So that happens very seldomly.

1514
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,809
>> When you say, come in for
reference, in what sense?

1515
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,519
Like the conversation
we're having here,

1516
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,145
and you can
reference that stuff?

1517
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:39,979
>> Yeah.

1518
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,732
Like sometimes,
people are like, yeah,

1519
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,151
I met this reptilian
being that was so and so.

1520
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,861
And so I was like, oh,
that's the same one

1521
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,113
that TReb showed me.

1522
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,865
Or I wonder what happened
in this timeline.

1523
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,283
It gives me a better
understanding.

1524
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,869
And I don't understand
what it is in the moment,

1525
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,914
but in reflecting later, I
always get what's going on.

1526
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,748
>> I see.

1527
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,000
>> So that's the second
most common occurrence.

1528
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,670
And then the last one is where
I'm like in a deep meditative

1529
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,464
state, where everything's
just kind of blacked out,

1530
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,633
sometimes colors,
sometimes things like that.

1531
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,386
And I'm able to hear what's
going on in the session.

1532
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:15,640
Now, if I channel 100 times,
probably 85 to 90 of them

1533
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,518
are me and TReb hanging out.

1534
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,772
All of them, but one of them
would be the deep meditation

1535
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,691
where I'm hearing the session.

1536
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,151
And this only
occurs when there is

1537
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,987
something I really need to hear
in that moment in the session.

1538
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,447
So it very rarely occurs.

1539
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,949
>> Do you ever go in and out,
like you're hanging out with

1540
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,492
him, and all of a sudden you
get sucked back into the room?

1541
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,743
>> No, never.

1542
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,579
It's always with
TReb all the time,

1543
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,956
or he's showing me
something, or then.

1544
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,917
And the second most common
one where he's showing me

1545
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,460
something, it's not with him.

1546
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,505
It's me separately by
myself seeing these things.

1547
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,674
So that rarely ever occurs.

1548
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,219
Out of 100 times, maybe 14
times I'll be doing that.

1549
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,388
So it's not very-- and it's
probably less than that,

1550
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:59,517
but I'm trying to give a scale
for people to understand that.

1551
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,145
>> Now, do you--

1552
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,022
since starting the
channeling, since having

1553
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,025
these conversations with
TReb, the meditations,

1554
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,570
have you become more--

1555
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,655
instead of just applying
these things to your life,

1556
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,908
have you noticed your
own intuitiveness

1557
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:20,038
or psychic abilities, or
anything else happening

1558
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,040
in these past few years?

1559
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,291
>> Absolutely.

1560
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,876
The integration process.

1561
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,921
And this is something
that's fairly new to me.

1562
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:33,092
I've been doing channeling in
the sense of public channeling

1563
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:37,096
since about 2010, late 2010.

1564
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,850
And in that time,
I was always aware

1565
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,227
that TReb's energy
was around me,

1566
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,771
but it never went past that.

1567
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,440
My life, my intuition
was good, but it

1568
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,069
was no better than where I was
when I first started meditating

1569
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,613
and learning to receive.

1570
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,532
In the last year, year
and a half-- well,

1571
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,283
it's probably closer
to two years now--

1572
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,869
I've actually been more
conscious of TReb and Aridif

1573
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,704
as they come through.

1574
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:05,917
I can hear TReb give me messages
while I'm in the wakened state.

1575
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,794
I feel more of
his consciousness.

1576
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:12,799
My personality even is more
the style of TReb, where--

1577
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,843
like TReb, he loves everything.

1578
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,303
He wants to
experience everything.

1579
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,639
And I find more of
that energy in me.

1580
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,557
And there's always been
a part of that for me.

1581
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:23,810
I've always enjoyed
enjoying things,

1582
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,270
but to a different extent.

1583
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,314
I could feel that combining
with TReb's energy.

1584
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,649
So it's like an amalgamation.

1585
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,401
And this goes with
psychic ability.

1586
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,152
It goes with everything.

1587
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,822
There's times where I grab
something and walk it over

1588
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,614
to Kalina.

1589
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,783
And she's like, I was just
going to ask you for that.

1590
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,369
Or things simple like
that, like picking

1591
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,954
a movie that she
had wanted to watch,

1592
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,956
or a song that she
was dying to hear.

1593
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,999
So those things.

1594
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,543
And that shows a great deal
about both of our connection

1595
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,377
too as well.

1596
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:55,341
But meeting Kalina was probably
one of the energetic shifting

1597
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,468
points on a lot of things.

1598
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:01,222
When I met Kalina, it's just
the energy shifted so much.

1599
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,891
I finally found a partner
who was on the same journey

1600
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,059
that I was.

1601
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,894
The same excitements.

1602
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,896
She met me through
the work I was doing.

1603
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,524
She was helping me
edit videos and stuff

1604
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,901
as we developed a friendship
for a couple of years.

1605
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,697
And then as my divorce
happened with my ex-wife, then

1606
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,990
me and her got together.

1607
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,075
And we started a relationship.

1608
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,077
And her excitements
and my excitements,

1609
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,830
because they're on the same
level, we reflect that.

1610
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:29,125
So our psychic ability helps.

1611
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,210
The efforts of the
work has helped.

1612
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,755
I was just-- when I
first started channeling,

1613
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,131
I was doing it for fun.

1614
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,343
I was doing it for the benefit
of other people, which I still

1615
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,177
am.

1616
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,304
But I had a daytime job.

1617
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,431
I worked that job
10 hours a day.

1618
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:47,060
>> I was going to say, how in
the world could you meditate

1619
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,021
for as long as you did
for the first two years,

1620
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,024
and still maintain a
job, and have a son?

1621
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,151
And that's crazy.

1622
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,194
Did you sleep?

1623
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:59,864
>> Well, the first hour and 25
minutes, that was pretty easy.

1624
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,075
The first one in the
morning before all the kids.

1625
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,868
Because I used to
babysit, so I was at home.

1626
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,702
>> Oh, wow.

1627
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,870
>> I could work from home.

1628
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,539
And when these four to
six kids would come over,

1629
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,958
I would be able to meditate
before they got there, and then

1630
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,670
once at lunch time when
I put them all for a nap,

1631
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,922
and once after Jeremy.

1632
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,675
He would get home from school
after the kids would leave.

1633
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:22,136
And then I would be able to
put him to bed, and then do it.

1634
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,596
>> So you figured
it out somehow.

1635
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:24,389
>> I did.

1636
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:28,059
>> You managed to
get those several--

1637
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,977
two to four hours a day?

1638
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,522
>> Well, three of the
meditations were an hour

1639
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,481
to an hour and 25.

1640
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,609
My closed-eye technique didn't
require me to be anywhere.

1641
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,069
I could still be
present with you.

1642
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,737
Like right now, I'm
closing my eyes.

1643
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:40,947
I can hear you.

1644
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,573
I can hear Kalina, so I'm OK.

1645
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,119
And if I didn't need my
eyes, I could literally up

1646
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,330
to six to eight hours a day
do the closed-eye technique.

1647
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,250
Whenever I didn't need my eyes,
they were shut all the time.

1648
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,126
I was dedicated.

1649
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:53,668
I was like--

1650
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,252
>> Wow.

1651
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,044
That's awesome.

1652
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:55,461
>> Yeah.

1653
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:55,961
I was like--

1654
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,879
>> I'm taking notes.

1655
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,464
>> An addict for meditation.

1656
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:58,798
>> Yeah.

1657
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,590
>> It was.

1658
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,300
I was addicted to it.

1659
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,802
>> Do you still meditate then?

1660
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,304
>> The only meditation I need
now is when I connect to TReb.

1661
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,307
I do it so frequently, that
that is my meditation now.

1662
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,308
>> I was going to say--

1663
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,810
because it sounds
like a meditation.

1664
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,188
You're going to this deep--
you're going to another planet.

1665
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,273
Jeez.

1666
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,107
That's awesome.

1667
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,194
>> Well, in all honesty, though,
it's something that I found

1668
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,904
about people in their
spiritual journey.

1669
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,950
And something that just
recently was brought up

1670
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,493
in a conversation.

1671
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,787
When you reach a certain
point of integrating

1672
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,332
with these beings or integrating
with your higher self, whatever

1673
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,210
it is, when you feel
good about your life

1674
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,753
when you're living
that vibration,

1675
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:41,090
there's not always as
much need for meditation.

1676
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,469
So when I meditate and connect
my TReb, I'm integrating.

1677
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,804
But during the day now,
I'm integrating, too,

1678
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:51,017
because I used that meditation
to pull myself out of suffering

1679
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,268
and pain to start with.

1680
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,271
And then I used it
to hone my skills.

1681
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,314
My skills are here.

1682
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,523
They're strong.

1683
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,233
I don't have very much
suffering anymore.

1684
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,529
I'm still human, so a
little bit here and there.

1685
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,531
So now there's not
as much a need.

1686
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:09,619
And the time I spend with TReb,
I'm doing this now as a living.

1687
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,164
So when I'm doing it once,
twice, three times a day,

1688
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,749
that's my meditation.

1689
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,791
It works.

1690
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,668
>> Awesome, awesome, awesome.

1691
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:22,006
Well, in addition to
TReb, you channel Aridif.

1692
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:22,798
>> Yes.

1693
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,176
>> And recently
I heard Metatron.

1694
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,345
Who else do you channel?

1695
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,388
And then maybe we can
get into a little bit

1696
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,807
of what led up to bringing
in these other entities.

1697
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:32,600
>> Sure.

1698
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,143
>> Let's start with Aridif
before we get into anybody

1699
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,560
else.

1700
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,353
>> OK.

1701
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,230
>> Because he's the
other most known.

1702
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,857
It's almost like--
lately, have you

1703
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,692
been channeling
Aridif more than TReb?

1704
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,652
>> Much more.

1705
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,488
Much more than TReb
even at this point.

1706
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,074
There is a high
resonance for him.

1707
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:51,869
One of my friends
who makes videos,

1708
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,581
he knows that I'm kind of a
modest person in a lot of ways.

1709
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,542
And he puts up this
thing, "Greatest Channeler

1710
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,584
In The World on YouTube."

1711
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,087
And I said, dude, well,
you didn't even tell me.

1712
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,797
You would have asked
me to take it down.

1713
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:03,965
I said, no, I wouldn't have.

1714
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,675
But still.

1715
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,054
He said something that
really clicked with me.

1716
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,224
He said the wisdom
and essence of Bashar,

1717
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,642
because a lot of
people know Bashar

1718
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:19,313
as a very wise high energy
being, and the heart

1719
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,775
center of TReb, which
TReb's a huge love bucket.

1720
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:23,901
Everybody loves that.

1721
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,820
And he said, that's
what Aridif encompasses.

1722
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,365
And that's why Aridif is his
favorite channeled being.

1723
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,492
So people are dying
for Aridif right now.

1724
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,828
They want to have time with him.

1725
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:35,746
They want to hear
what he has to say.

1726
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,290
Brilliant, brilliant being.

1727
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,127
He is to TReb what
TReb is to me.

1728
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:41,961
>> Oh.

1729
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,339
>> So like when you look at
me, TReb is like maybe a future

1730
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,340
version of myself.

1731
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,509
And it could be looked at
in a lot of different ways.

1732
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,052
But he's like a guide to me.

1733
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,346
He's a higher density,
higher knowledge

1734
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,472
being that I pull from.

1735
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,265
>> TReb is to you.

1736
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,057
>> Yes.

1737
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,226
TReb, for my
information and energy.

1738
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,228
And TReb does that with Aridif.

1739
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,980
TReb's a fifth density being.

1740
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,523
And Aridif's a
sixth density being.

1741
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:06,277
So energetically,
it's a higher energy.

1742
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,528
>> And do TReb and Aridif--

1743
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,905
I assume, they do communicate?

1744
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,780
They know each other?

1745
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,407
>> They know each other well.

1746
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,367
I had heard stories about
Aridif before I ever

1747
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,952
connected with him.

1748
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,330
Back when I heard it--
because most of these entities

1749
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,874
don't have names of their
own, they just have energy.

1750
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,708
>> Right.

1751
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,710
>> And they give us names,
because we're humans,

1752
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,211
and we need names to identify.

1753
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:29,008
So TReb would talk about a
being called Deneb Cygnus.

1754
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,135
And that's the Deneb,
like the star Deneb,

1755
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,221
and Cygnus, the
constellation of the Swan.

1756
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,558
And he said, this entity
named Deneb Cygnus,

1757
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,268
and then he would tell
a story about him,

1758
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,104
or tell a story about
information that Deneb Cygnus

1759
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,189
had shared with him.

1760
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,566
Well, eventually, I found
out through the book

1761
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,028
that I did about TReb and his
people, that that was Aridif.

1762
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,446
And Aridif gives us that name.

1763
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:54,408
Aridif used that name with
humans a long time ago.

1764
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,327
Let me-- yeah, and I'm
jumping ahead of myself.

1765
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,371
So let me give a little
introduction to Aridif.

1766
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:02,041
Aridif is an Ancient
Pleiadian entity,

1767
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,626
but he lives in the
star called Deneb.

1768
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,837
His race moved out
of the Pleiades star

1769
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:10,633
system, which tens of
thousands of races live there.

1770
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,511
They pulled their race out,
because energetically, they

1771
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,514
needed a different--
he explained it

1772
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,349
as, we needed room to grow.

1773
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:23,938
But what I think is the
collective consciousness

1774
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,692
of a race is very
similar to a star.

1775
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,820
And in fact, that's why they
incorporate so much energy.

1776
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,364
If it's a smaller
collective, it only

1777
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:35,074
needs a little space to grow.

1778
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,326
But when you have these
huge consciousnesses

1779
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,371
and you have a lot of them,
they need energetic space.

1780
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,624
And that is shown by the
star that they travel around.

1781
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:47,044
And Deneb is this gigantic,
huge, supermassive,

1782
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:50,548
like 150 times the
size of our sun.

1783
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,925
And that's where his
race needed to go,

1784
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,052
because they grew into that.

1785
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,846
They sprung into a huge--

1786
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,305
and when you listen
to Aridif, you

1787
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:03,769
can tell more than just
his sentient energy, more

1788
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,772
than his wisdom, he's
just huge expanded.

1789
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,315
They're at the level
right before you

1790
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,900
leave physical
reality altogether

1791
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,611
and join the
oversoul energy back

1792
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:13,988
in the planetary collective.

1793
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,198
So I mean he's this huge being.

1794
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,867
And now they inhabit this star.

1795
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:20,453
And a lot of people ask about--

1796
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,871
they don't know
what he looks like.

1797
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,457
And there's some art out there
of him, and it's beautiful.

1798
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,833
Kalina did art too.

1799
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,960
She's been able to see
him too in her mind's eye.

1800
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,212
Never TReb, but Aridif.

1801
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,257
They had a past life where
she had met Aridif when

1802
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,425
he physically came to Earth.

1803
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,342
>> When he was Deneb.

1804
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,594
>> Back in ancient Egypt.

1805
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,262
>> When he was known as Deneb?

1806
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,054
>> Well, no.

1807
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,099
The Aridif name was one
that was known to Earth,

1808
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,644
but TReb never gave me
that identity until later.

1809
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,939
So he was still known as Aridif
when I first heard of him,

1810
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:53,819
but TReb, for whatever reason,
gave me the Deneb Cygnus name.

1811
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,531
>> So back in the Egyptian days,
he was known as Aridif as well?

1812
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,993
>> Well, he said the name came
from the era and how they knew

1813
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:01,827
him.

1814
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,079
So maybe they knew
what star he came from,

1815
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,874
and back then they might
have called it Aridif.

1816
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,750
>> Oh, I see.

1817
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,627
>> I still don't
know the specifics,

1818
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:09,919
but I think that's what it is.

1819
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,630
>> So maybe in Egyptian times,
that's what they called them.

1820
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,005
>> Right.

1821
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:13,464
>> OK.

1822
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,049
>> And he hung out
with Egyptians.

1823
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,259
He just recently
alluded to the fact

1824
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,137
that he had hung out with
South African tribes,

1825
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,599
that he hung out with
Egyptians, that he hung out

1826
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,436
with Indians, and some
Southern American tribes.

1827
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:31,315
So he has been on the Earth
manifested as a physical being

1828
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,944
in order to co-create
with Earth before,

1829
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,737
kind of like an energetic
quarantine, where

1830
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,448
it was kind of interference.

1831
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,034
And that's a difficult,
long subject to get into.

1832
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,246
But he has co-created
with humans.

1833
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,498
And I think that him
understanding humanity

1834
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,501
before he came here, even though
it was a much older version,

1835
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,588
gave him a great opportunity
when he teaches to have

1836
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,131
it really resonate with people.

1837
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,301
Plus the amount of wisdom that
comes out of him is ungodly.

1838
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,970
It's just beautiful.

1839
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,849
>> So Aridif used to interact
with the human race back

1840
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:08,936
in the day; South Africans,
Egyptians, probably more.

1841
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,312
But has it been a while then?

1842
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,815
Is this like his--

1843
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,275
he took a break,
and now he's back.

1844
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,277
And humanity is like, oh,
wow, look at humanity.

1845
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,028
Or has he been
constantly monitoring?

1846
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:20,781
And do other people
channel Aridif?

1847
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,742
>> From what I know,
no one else has.

1848
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:27,246
Some people said that
his energy is familiar.

1849
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,248
So I don't know.

1850
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,376
But I do know that
he's been interacting

1851
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,336
with humans for a long time.

1852
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:38,007
It's been thousands of years, he
said, before he's reconnected.

1853
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,134
And even now he's not
physically connecting.

1854
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:40,968
>> Right.

1855
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:44,221
>> Right now, it's an important
growth time for humans.

1856
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:47,308
And a lot of the
hands-on interactions

1857
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,437
are not appreciated
by some of the ETs.

1858
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,522
For instance, type
1 and type 2, this

1859
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,192
is the definition Aridif
and TReb have given.

1860
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:59,570
Type 1, they'll do it in the
way that TReb and Aridif are.

1861
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,489
>> Type 1 civilization
or type 1 ET?

1862
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,951
>> Type 1 extraterrestrial
kind, energetic kind.

1863
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,453
>> And what is--

1864
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:12,291
>> A type 1 defined is an entity
who respects the free will

1865
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,043
of all things,
will not interfere.

1866
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:14,877
>> OK.

1867
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,339
>> And looks above and below
them, energetically speaking.

1868
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,425
They look above them
for inspiration, wisdom,

1869
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,426
to incorporate.

1870
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,970
And then below them to
redistribute that information.

1871
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,555
They see themselves
as a part of one.

1872
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,348
>> I see.

1873
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,724
>> A type 2 sees division.

1874
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:32,770
A type 2 being only
looks below them

1875
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,316
for what they can
overpower or oversee.

1876
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:38,525
They never look above them.

1877
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,987
They look equal or below to
them, energetically speaking.

1878
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:45,616
They also are not afraid
to interject themselves

1879
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,827
on the behalf of
themselves or others.

1880
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:52,122
For instance, a lot of
these channeled entities

1881
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,749
that have come out
are talking about,

1882
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,959
we are going to help you.

1883
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,293
We're going to do this for you.

1884
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,836
We're going to do that for you.

1885
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,838
They're doing that, because--

1886
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,382
some of them with great intent.

1887
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,633
They are like, we love you.

1888
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,425
You're messing up.

1889
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,593
We want to help you.

1890
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,929
But in their mind, they
know better than we do.

1891
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,681
And Aridif and TReb
come from a place

1892
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:11,600
that you guys manifest what
you want as a collective,

1893
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,852
because that is what you want.

1894
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,312
And we will respect
your journey.

1895
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:18,107
Even if you nuke yourself to
oblivion, we will respect it.

1896
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:20,067
And we will never
step in the way.

1897
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,236
Because they know
it's a soul's journey.

1898
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,280
The other entities look at it
as a physical thing, or even

1899
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:28,993
a soul level, just at
a different interval.

1900
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,495
So these are the
fundamental differences.

1901
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,708
And back when Aridif did
interact with humans,

1902
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,501
he did it from his
incarnation now,

1903
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,671
but he also has done it
from previous incarnations

1904
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,589
of his Denebian race.

1905
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:43,716
So in that way--

1906
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,758
>> Denebian race.

1907
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,092
>> Yeah.

1908
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,052
And Ancient Pleiadians
is what we call it,

1909
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,096
because that's how he
introduced themselves.

1910
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,641
But Denebian, that's
another term for their race.

1911
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,934
They're from the star Deneb.

1912
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,271
So Denebians are
another term for them.

1913
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:02,943
But they have interacted
from previous incarnations.

1914
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,404
So he dealt with humans
not just in this life,

1915
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,655
but his past lives too.

1916
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,448
>> Interesting.

1917
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,282
OK.

1918
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,492
And the overall message--

1919
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,787
so they're obviously type 1 ETs.

1920
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,123
And their overall message,
if you could sum it up

1921
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,208
>> If I could sum it
up in one sentence,

1922
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,627
it's you create everything.

1923
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:24,965
And If I could sum it
up in a small paragraph,

1924
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,926
we create that physical
reality around us,

1925
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:29,928
and every aspect of it.

1926
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:33,390
And when we do, we
bring the reflections

1927
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:38,103
of what's inside of ourselves
to be outside of ourselves

1928
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,104
and to co-create.

1929
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,648
So a lot of people look at it.

1930
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:45,027
Well, how is Reuben
a projection of Rob?

1931
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,820
Well, it has to be.

1932
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,281
There's you there,
and there's me there.

1933
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,825
But I'm bringing you into
my reality for a reason,

1934
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:52,868
as you are me.

1935
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,329
We're co-creating a reflection.

1936
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,624
And literally, you're
a version that I

1937
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,584
projected into my universe.

1938
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,252
But it's very literal
in those terms.

1939
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,962
And people don't look
at it in that way.

1940
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,631
They're like,
figuratively, you create.

1941
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,257
No, literally.

1942
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,093
And figuratively.

1943
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:09,968
>> Right.

1944
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,678
>> That's the message.

1945
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:14,181
And they explore
all parts of it.

1946
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,309
They give answers for
extraterrestrial things.

1947
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,812
What's going on in our galaxy?

1948
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,065
I've always termed it universal,
or galactic knowledge,

1949
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,442
universal knowledge,
what's going on out there.

1950
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:28,445
And that's an important part.

1951
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:31,657
The other entities, too,
that I've channeled,

1952
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:34,243
Nihal, Metatron.

1953
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:37,663
Metatron would say that
the universal and galactic

1954
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,957
knowledge is not so important.

1955
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:43,418
What's important is you
growing into who you are.

1956
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:46,255
So sometimes he talks about
humans distract themselves

1957
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,632
with what's going on out there
when they can't figure out

1958
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,633
what's going on down here.

1959
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:49,967
>> Sure.

1960
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,010
>> A different point of
view, and I respect that.

1961
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,679
And I understand.

1962
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,851
But TReb and Aridif bring us a
perspective that's universal.

1963
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,520
And it gives us our
opportunity to say

1964
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:05,399
how humans fit in this universal
complex, which is something

1965
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,401
that a lot of
people have strived

1966
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,153
to know their whole lives.

1967
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:13,532
And it's very easy to see the
human race as a part of it,

1968
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,410
but not how each individual
is a part of first the Earth

1969
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,828
collective, then
the universalness.

1970
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,371
It's amazing.

1971
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,499
It's something that
Aridif sums up very well.

1972
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,544
>> And just you
mentioned the Nihal.

1973
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,462
>> Yes.

1974
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,172
>> Is that a collective
consciousness?

1975
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,006
>> Yes.

1976
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,799
That is a collective
consciousness.

1977
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,051
Now, the Nihal, a very
interesting story.

1978
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,928
I'll give you a bit about them.

1979
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:37,890
The Nihal are future humans.

1980
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,727
They exist as one of our
timelines in the future.

1981
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:46,273
So it's a probable reality
where we leave Earth.

1982
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,317
Well, not all of us,
but a chunk of us

1983
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,277
leave Earth and
become the Nihal.

1984
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:54,698
And we evolve into very
short beings, about--

1985
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,534
I can't remember-- three to
four foot, somewhere in there.

1986
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,370
Orange-ish skin, highly psychic.

1987
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,164
And we evolve into that.

1988
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,584
Now, the fun part, the
part where it ties back in,

1989
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:10,297
the Nihal are the race
who seeded TReb's race.

1990
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:15,594
So TReb's race was a
byproduct, or a direct product,

1991
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:20,057
of engineering DNA
from a human being DNA

1992
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:24,311
and from a second density lizard
being who lived in, I believe,

1993
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,521
the Capellan region, which
is where TReb comes from.

1994
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,650
>> Human or Nihal DNA,
but Nihal being human.

1995
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,442
>> Right.

1996
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:30,692
Nihal.

1997
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,402
But it is different
than human DNA.

1998
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,238
And that's a good
point you bring up.

1999
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,660
also occurs when one race
leaves their home planet

2000
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,286
and goes to another.

2001
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,830
The planet itself is a being.

2002
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,333
It's a seventh density
collective being.

2003
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,125
>> Right.

2004
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,753
>> And then this race that
comes is also a collective

2005
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,756
of the seventh density with
all the oversouls at the lower

2006
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,132
seventh density.

2007
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:55,133
And then they meet.

2008
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,927
They co-create a
brand new energy.

2009
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,430
So both collectives merge
into one, and the DNA changes.

2010
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:03,892
And that's why when the human
race leaves the other planets,

2011
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,270
they change their physical
appearance, because their DNA

2012
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,145
changes.

2013
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,107
Their physical body
adapts to the new merging

2014
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,276
of the collective
planet consciousness

2015
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,069
and their race's consciousness.

2016
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,363
So that's a part of it too.

2017
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,992
Now, when we're
getting into the Nihal,

2018
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,619
the reason for doing TReb's
race, a lot of people

2019
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,621
are like, well, if we're
evolved, why would we

2020
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:25,539
be messing with DNA?

2021
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,623
We've had that done to us.

2022
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,750
It's not very nice.

2023
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,795
There's such a stigma around
negative reptilian energy.

2024
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,131
And it was hinted, not
ever directly said,

2025
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,008
yes, this is the 100% reason.

2026
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:40,304
But TReb, Aridif, but more so
than that, another entity who

2027
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:45,183
I channeled in the book about
TReb's race, one of their--

2028
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:46,893
I think it was the
military, ex-military.

2029
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:47,853
>> The woman?

2030
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:48,937
>> Yes, the woman.

2031
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:53,317
She said that the reason
that they did that

2032
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:56,528
was so that they could show
the entire galaxy that not

2033
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:57,988
all reptilians are bad.

2034
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,408
The stigma of Earth,
especially Earth,

2035
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,702
was that reptilians
are negative.

2036
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,329
They will eat your children.

2037
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,121
They'll drug you.

2038
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,915
They'll throw you in a cave,
and put you in their pie.

2039
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,626
>> What is it the--

2040
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,795
David Icke, the queen, and all
of our government officials

2041
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:14,838
evolved.

2042
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,174
Evil reptilians taking
over the planet.

2043
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:18,342
>> And I get it.

2044
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,261
>> That could--
that's probably true.

2045
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,222
>> But not every
reptilian has that.

2046
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:25,098
>> Yeah, exactly.

2047
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,934
>> And TReb-- this is
something I commend TReb for.

2048
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,103
He is one of the very few
channels who have come out

2049
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,231
and said, listen, the
evil reptilians are there.

2050
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:34,608
This is what
they've done to you.

2051
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,611
This is how they're still
doing things to you.

2052
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,280
But you're focusing on it, and
it's going to keep going on.

2053
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,492
When you pull your focus from it
and start focusing on the power

2054
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,912
you have, then it doesn't-- then
even if they're standing next

2055
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,624
to you slapping people with
whips, they can't touch you.

2056
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,667
>> Just like Jesus
and the cross.

2057
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:59,049
It was much-- the
story's go as much

2058
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,259
they were whipping
him and torturing him,

2059
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,386
he didn't feel a thing.

2060
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,261
>> Yeah.

2061
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:05,347
And that's the
beauty part of it.

2062
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,432
That's something that
TReb brings to us.

2063
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,226
And the Nihal wanted
to show us that.

2064
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,311
They wanted to show us--

2065
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:14,523
I think it was targeted for
humans, but around the galaxy,

2066
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:16,358
there's still a stigma
that most reptilians

2067
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,859
are neg-- even if
they've interacted

2068
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,112
with a good reptilian.

2069
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:23,031
Humanoids, I think, because
of the damage they've

2070
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,410
had through slavery, the
Anunnaki was half-reptilian,

2071
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,870
the ancient reptilians,
the Earth reptilians.

2072
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,164
Those are all bad
stories for humans.

2073
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:35,127
And that's kind of built
in our DNA to fear them.

2074
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,630
And people, like David Icke,
who've research just that part

2075
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,299
of it and shared it, it
scares the crap out of people.

2076
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:45,262
>> It continues
to feed into that.

2077
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,681
Well, over the next
couple of days,

2078
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:49,015
let's get into some channeling.

2079
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:52,894
And I'd love to talk to TReb and
Aridif and explore their world

2080
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:53,729
some more.

2081
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,773
Thanks for sharing
your adventures.

2082
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,024
>> You're absolutely welcome.

2083
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,609
>> And we'll see
some more of you.

2084
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:00,402
>> All right.

2085
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:01,236
>> Thanks, Rob.
