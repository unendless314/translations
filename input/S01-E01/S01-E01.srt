1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:08,299
So I started channeling 20 years ago,

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,344
it's crazy when I think that it's been 20 years.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,680
And probably about eight or nine months

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,140
after I started channeling.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,435
I started getting information from this

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,395
group called the Pleiadian Collective

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,147
and they’re 9th dimensional beings.

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,566
They do not have physical form.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:29,154
They are beings of light and rather incarnating to a planetary body.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,740
They actually align with a stellar body.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,366
So they align with Alcyone

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,034
the central sun and the Pleiades system.

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,205
And they are a little different than the other beings

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:39,789
that I work with

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,916
because I actually do work with a lot of different beings.

16
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,671
I work with beings from Lyra, from Sirius, and Zetas.

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,842
Let's see,  Arcturians...so I do work with a number of beings

18
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,636
but the Pleiadians always come through first and foremost

19
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,556
and sometimes these other beings will show up and they

20
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,060
may show up today and they will blend their energy with the Pleiadians.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,480
So you might notice that the energy shifts a little bit

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,524
because these beings have come in and they always take point

23
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,194
because it's somewhat easier for them to receive the...

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,363
...for you to receive the information from the Pleiadians.

25
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,741
They have such heart-based energy.

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,452
And they're also a little different

27
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,245
because they work with tone and sound.

28
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,957
So that's why they're dialect is different than my own.

29
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,210
It's not any one particular dialect.

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,630
It's just tones and sounds that resonate with you at a cellular level.

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,090
So over the course of the next several days,

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,759
they'll continue working with you

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,969
and in addition to getting the information it's

34
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,846
as if you're getting a healing as well,

35
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,598
so you want to make sure you drink plenty of water.

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,266
Just help move the energy through the body.

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,854
Ah yes hello dears. This is the 9th dimensional

38
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,357
Pleiadian Collective and it is a pleasure and an honor to

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,359
have the opportunity to connect with you all.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,515
because you're going through a phase right now where it

41
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,810
is vital and in in your development

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,521
that you become more and

43
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,732
more aware of the subtle frequencies around you and as

44
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,569
you become better able to

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,613
perceive these subtle frequencies.

46
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,700
It makes life a lot easier for you

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,537
because you are learning how to operate more from

48
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,540
a state of being which will then guide you

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,126
to your doing state and if you're not

50
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,212
conscious of the subtle frequencies, you can often miss those

51
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,340
breadcrumbs that the universe is providing you to take

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,428
steps in a divinely guided

53
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
way to get you on your path

54
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,431
of higher service.

55
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,810
Also know that we are working with all of you energetically and

56
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,687
you can connect with us at any time.

57
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,480
You don't need Wendy.

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,524
All you have to do is put yourself in your heart center.

59
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,610
Think of something that makes you smile.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,030
Ask for assistance and we will do our best

61
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,199
to put the information in your field until you get it or you

62
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,326
no longer want it.

63
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,329
We are helping you to elevate your frequency.

64
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,123
The one thing that we always do any time that

65
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,210
we work with you, we work with harmonics at the

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,713
very beginning, in our opening greeting and we

67
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,798
actually do an attunement with you.

68
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,302
We don't really talk about this a lot, but we help you to alter your

69
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,223
vibrational field and help you to realign anything

70
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,433
that maybe misaligned or not

71
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,896
in in alignment with your true heart's desires.

72
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,316
So your own guides are here

73
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,319
feeding us information and what you need we will

74
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,737
say there are no silly questions.

75
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,280
So

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,533
just know that your

77
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,705
curiosity your fearlessness is

78
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,208
appreciated by many.

79
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,545
So we'll go ahead and dive in and see where you'd like to begin.

80
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,631
How may we best be of service to you today?

81
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,677
Ever wondered if their is intelligent

82
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,095
life elsewhere in the universe?

83
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,974
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

84
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,309
My name is Reuben Langdon

85
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:32,689
And on March 29th, 2007 in the middle of the day,

86
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,818
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

87
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,319
Coincidentally, I was working on

88
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,571
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

89
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,908
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

90
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,869
To find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

91
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,580
...are they here with us?

92
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,088
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

93
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,923
...what is their purpose?

94
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,634
Why don't they make themselves more known?

95
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,845
Why the secrecy?

96
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,097
I've asked these questions to many experts,

97
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,766
Yet, each seems to have a different theory.

98
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,227
So I thought to myself,

99
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,813
why not ask the aliens directly?

100
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,857
So that's what I've set out to do!

101
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,233
Well, sort of...

102
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,913
>> So Wendy, welcome.

103
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,705
>> Thank you--

104
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,539
>> Thank you for--

105
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,332
>> --for having me.

106
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,500
>> --being here and uh.

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,377
Can you tell us,
can you tell me,

108
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:23,508
and tell us, I guess everybody
that's watching, first of all,

109
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,843
how did you get into
the channeling process?

110
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,930
And how did you
come into contact

111
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,057
with the beings known
as the Pleiadians?

112
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,141
>> Oh, gosh.

113
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:32,934
OK.

114
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,144
So, yeah, I think a couple
different things there.

115
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:40,525
So it was around 1994 and I
started having some visions.

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,985
And I didn't really
know what they were.

117
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,738
They weren't the
happiest of visions,

118
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,824
but I wasn't frightened by them.

119
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,617
And so I started
doing some research

120
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,203
for that to see if it was
past-life related, because that

121
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,247
was what my instinct was.

122
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,333
And so as I started
that research

123
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,252
to find out more
about past lives,

124
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,420
I came across channeling.

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,296
And I didn't know what it was.

126
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,714
I didn't know
anybody who did it.

127
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,341
But I just knew it
was something that I

128
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,968
was supposed to be doing.

129
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,760
And so--

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,680
>> When you came across it,
you came across it as you saw

131
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,722
somebody else doing that?

132
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,557
>> No.

133
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
I came across it in books.

134
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,434
>> Oh, OK.

135
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,228
>> And there wasn't a lot of
channel material out there

136
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,020
at the time.

137
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,401
There was the Seth
material and Sanaya Roman

138
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,527
had some books out.

139
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,529
But really, there
wasn't a whole lot.

140
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,781
And it was very familiar.

141
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,033
And I just knew it was
something I was supposed to do.

142
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:35,496
So I found some
books and I started

143
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,498
doing some of the
meditation exercises

144
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,375
and the visualization exercises.

145
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,169
And I was trying to
channel verbally,

146
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,421
but it wasn't really
happening for me.

147
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,715
I was having really
visceral experiences,

148
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,758
like my eyes would
flutter and water

149
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,051
and my hands would tingle.

150
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,887
But I couldn't form the words.

151
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,722
I couldn't get the words out.

152
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,933
And so I'd put it aside and
then I'd come back to it.

153
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,352
And in the interim, I did
a lot of work on myself.

154
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:03,191
I studied meditation and
did a lot of inner work.

155
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,942
And then I'd come back
to it periodically.

156
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,694
And I'd have kind of
the same experience.

157
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,821
And then one day, I knew
I was supposed to sit down

158
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,822
with a pen and paper--

159
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,615
>> OK.

160
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,575
>> --and I started
doing automatic writing.

161
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,367
>> Excellent.

162
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,662
>> And that I did--

163
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,623
well, for the first
two years, I wrote down

164
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,209
every single question
and every answer.

165
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,003
And about nine
months or so into it,

166
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,006
it was becoming very
cumbersome to write.

167
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,884
And so I put down
the pen and then

168
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,260
just started to
channel verbally,

169
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,555
because I was hearing it well
before I was able to write it.

170
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,182
And I still use
automatic writing today

171
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,061
because it's much easier for
me to remember the information.

172
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,104
It's a bit like a
lucid dream for me.

173
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,690
So at least I have
the written notes.

174
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,067
And I can go back to it.

175
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,654
But about nine months in, that's
when the Pleiadians showed up.

176
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,446
>> Interesting.

177
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,198
>> And they were waiting
for me to channel verbally

178
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,699
because they work
with tone and sound.

179
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,533
>> OK.

180
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,828
>> And a lot of people will
ask me where I'm from when they

181
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,456
hear the Pleiadians,
especially at the beginning,

182
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,375
they sounded a bit more British.

183
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,461
And then they started
working with new tones

184
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,338
and then it sounded a
bit more Australian.

185
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,839
And it's not any one dialect.

186
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,632
>> Right.

187
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,926
>> It's just tones and
sounds that resonate with you

188
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,636
at a cellular level.

189
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
And it was really
interesting for me

190
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,391
because when they started
channeling and working

191
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,060
with the new tones, it was using
all different kinds of muscles.

192
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,019
>> Oh, wow.

193
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,065
>> And I was like, OK, can
we tone it back just a bit?

194
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,857
>> Right.

195
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,359
>> Tone it, no pun intended.

196
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:33,155
But it really affects
us vibrationally.

197
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,700
And I could tell that
there was a big difference.

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,245
So we get a healing
when we work with them.

199
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,330
Not only do we receive
the information,

200
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,125
but the tones and sounds help to
alter the cellular structure--

201
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,959
>> OK.

202
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,462
>> --and create more balance
and harmony in the body.

203
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,299
And how did I first meet them?

204
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,217
I think I've been working
with them all along.

205
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,010
>> OK.

206
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,637
>> And I know that there's
an aspect of me that is part

207
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,222
of the Collective.

208
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,600
There are about 2,500
beings in the group.

209
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,978
And there is an aspect of
me that is a part of that.

210
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,438
And they're in the
ninth dimension.

211
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,191
And they don't have physical
form, they're beings of light.

212
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,402
And they align
with Alcyone, which

213
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,364
is the central sun in
the Pleiades star system.

214
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,034
And because they don't
have physical bodies,

215
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,369
they don't incarnate,
but they align

216
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,663
with a purpose, or a function.

217
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,418
And they're here to help us
with records, and information,

218
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,337
and to kind of
oversee what we're

219
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,464
doing to help us
along the way so

220
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,633
that we can start
taking ownership

221
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,217
and guardianship of the planet.

222
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,969
And there's another
role that we're

223
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,097
about to step into at
the galactic level.

224
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,893
>> Well, so you mentioned
earlier that you formulated

225
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,187
questions and answers.

226
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,316
Were the questions
also being channeled?

227
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,108
>> No.

228
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,360
They were things that
I wanted to know about--

229
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,027
>> OK. Got you.

230
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,403
>> --problems I was
having in my life.

231
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,947
And I think, early on,
everybody has the same couple

232
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,740
questions.

233
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,532
Tell me about love.

234
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,367
Tell me about money.

235
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,034
Tell me about career.

236
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,868
>> Right.

237
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,538
>> And then it
evolves from there.

238
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,458
But they started helping
me with my own stuff.

239
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,126
And that's kind
of like the carrot

240
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,338
to get us to keep channeling.

241
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,131
And that's also one
of the hardest things,

242
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,716
I think, for people, what
do I want to know about?

243
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,718
We've forgotten how to
formulate questions.

244
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,054
We've forgotten how to
be curious, how to ask,

245
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,430
because we're so
conditioned just

246
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,850
to go along kind of mindlessly
making our way through our day.

247
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,643
>> Yeah.

248
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,688
>> So that's a big step
in working with them is

249
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,815
formulating your questions.

250
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,525
Because if you don't
ask, you don't get.

251
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,317
>> Right.

252
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,903
>> And it's one of
those tricky things.

253
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,321
It's like, well,
I don't know what

254
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,823
I don't know until I know it.

255
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,657
>> Right.

256
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,449
Yeah.

257
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,992
>> So where do I want to start?

258
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,369
What questions do I want to ask?

259
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,788
And what do I want to know
more about, especially when you

260
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,625
get to the more complex
questions, the bigger

261
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,668
universal questions--

262
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,085
>> Sure.

263
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,337
>> --because that can't be
revealed until you're ready

264
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:53,796
for it.

265
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,423
And once you formulate
the question,

266
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,175
that's kind of their
signal that you're ready

267
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,677
and they can give
more information.

268
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,469
>> Excellent.

269
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,888
Well, that's what we
want to get into today.

270
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:11,647
We have lots of questions
about the universal history

271
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,691
and story.

272
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,904
So right quick, before we
introduce the Pleiadians,

273
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,783
have you had any physical
contact in the light sense?

274
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,952
I mean, have you
seen these lights?

275
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,204
Have you had experiences
in that level?

276
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:32,626
>> With them, my strength
is as a clairsentient,

277
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,963
so I feel a lot of
things in my body.

278
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,425
I occasionally will see
things, as a clairvoyant,

279
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,136
literally seeing lights,
and auric fields,

280
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,095
and that kind of thing.

281
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:47,600
More of what I see in
the clairvoyant sense

282
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
is with my inner eye.

283
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,393
>> OK.

284
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,020
So like eyes closed and just--

285
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,022
>> Yeah, what I would
see in my mind's eye.

286
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,856
>> OK.

287
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,609
>> So when I do see them,
they're usually blue,

288
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,526
blue light.

289
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,028
Sometimes they have
geometric forms.

290
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,821
Sometimes triangles.

291
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
>> Hmm.

292
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,118
And so let me
clarify, so you can

293
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:11,499
see the geometric forms and
the lights, but you feel a--

294
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,667
almost like a human presence
or something like that?

295
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,001
How could you describe it?

296
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:14,960
>> I feel a frequency.

297
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,836
>> OK.

298
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,130
>> And yet, you could say
it's like a human presence.

299
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,923
>> OK.

300
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,799
>> It's like, well,
let's see, how can I--

301
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,803
>> Like I know my cameraman
here is standing here.

302
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,638
Is that--

303
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,055
>> Yes.

304
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:26,722
>> Is that a good analogy?

305
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,057
>> So you know what
his energy feels like.

306
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:28,849
>> Right.

307
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,310
>> And you wouldn't necessarily
have to turn around just

308
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,686
to know that that
person is standing--

309
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,020
>> Sure.

310
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,812
>> --behind you.

311
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,648
And they often
describe it as it's

312
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,067
like hearing somebody's
footsteps coming down the hall.

313
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,612
After a while, once you begin to
know what that person's energy

314
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,906
is like, what their
patterns are like,

315
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,033
you know who it is
by the sound of--

316
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,867
>> Of the footsteps.

317
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,284
>> --the footsteps,

318
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,077
>> Interesting.

319
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,328
>> --what the gait's like.

320
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,747
So it's kind of the
same thing with them.

321
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,791
I know it's them
when they show up.

322
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,001
Sometimes they show
up with other people.

323
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,170
And I can feel them,
but I know that they

324
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,256
brought other people along
because the frequency's

325
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:00,798
different.

326
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,633
And sometimes they're
making an introduction,

327
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,802
so they're beings that I
haven't worked with before.

328
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,763
>> And so when we say people,
we're talking about other light

329
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,597
beings?

330
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,558
>> Sometimes they're
light beings.

331
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,767
Sometimes they're physical.

332
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,979
Sometimes they're fifth
dimensional, sixth dimensional,

333
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,230
seventh dimensional.

334
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,524
And they do have bodies.

335
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,110
They're not as dense as ours,
but they do have physical form.

336
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,902
>> OK.

337
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,154
>> And I do work with
a variety of beings.

338
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,490
The Sirians that I work
with, they're physicals.

339
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,950
They're fifth dimensional.

340
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,121
But I don't necessarily
work with them

341
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,831
in a conscious way
where they're standing

342
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,291
physically in front of me.

343
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,917
It's more telepathic
communication

344
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,546
that I have with them, at
least in my waking hours.

345
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:47,177
>> And have you had physical
contact then with other beings,

346
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,596
non-light beings, body--

347
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,138
>> Yes.
>> OK.

348
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,139
>> Yes.
So--

349
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,056
>> Sirians?

350
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,849
Or--

351
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,725
>> No.

352
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,310
Different beings.

353
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,895
Some of them are insectoids.

354
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,855
>> Oh, interesting.

355
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,690
>> And then the Zetas as well.

356
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,482
>> OK.

357
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,194
>> And those are my
physical experiences.

358
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:08,866
And another group who I just
recently had an introduction

359
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,118
to, I don't have all
the bits and pieces

360
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,454
as to who they are,
exactly, but they're

361
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,916
kind of a cross
between the insectoids

362
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,628
and what we would
traditionally call the grays.

363
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,754
They look different.

364
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,213
And it's not the same species.

365
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,342
But they've shown up for me.

366
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,510
>> Interesting.

367
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,516
Do you find once you've opened
yourself up to, let's say,

368
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,436
this channeling experience
back in the '90s--

369
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,896
was it '94 you said?

370
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,814
>> When I started,
it was in '94.

371
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,484
And I had kind of my
breakthrough in '95.

372
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:48,280
>> Do you think that has
opened the door to other being

373
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,156
experiences?

374
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,034
Or do you think we're all
getting these experiences

375
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,869
and we're just
not tuned into it?

376
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,245
>> Well, both.

377
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,541
I think we're all
connected to our guides.

378
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,794
We've got two guides that
are with us 24 hours a day,

379
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,338
7 days a week, who
are helping us.

380
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,215
And then we've got our
solicited friends--

381
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:06,548
>> Everybody?

382
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:06,966
>> Everybody.

383
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,800
>> Oh, OK.

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,886
>> And I laugh because people
think that channeling is just

385
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,304
something that a few people do.

386
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,723
But everybody does it.

387
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,726
And to me, it's like
being an interpreter.

388
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,271
I recognize frequency
and I translate it

389
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,358
into a recognizable form,
whether that's writing

390
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,651
or whether it's speaking.

391
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,070
But I think any form
of creative expression

392
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,489
can be a form of channeling.

393
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,868
And my own experiences
with beings, I think,

394
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,744
started much younger.

395
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,995
I think it started in childhood.

396
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:37,871
>> OK.

397
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,916
>> But I didn't really
have an awareness,

398
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,044
a conscious awareness of that
until I started opening up

399
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,838
in my early 20s.

400
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,257
And I started having some
past-life experiences.

401
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,050
And at the time, I
didn't really understand

402
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,093
that's what was going on.

403
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,846
I was accessing some
of that information.

404
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,432
So once I made
conscious contact,

405
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,934
then some of the things that
had happened earlier in my life

406
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,310
made a lot more sense.

407
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,438
I understood, oh,
that's what that was.

408
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,522
>> I see.

409
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,858
So you think if we all
could tap into this,

410
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:11,155
then this channeling
experience, or our guides,

411
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,784
humanity would be a little
less hectic or frantic maybe?

412
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,577
>> I think so.

413
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,996
>> Or more because now there's
so much more out there that

414
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
we're not aware of.

415
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,583
How about in your life--

416
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm sure this could go on into a
much deeper conversation which,

417
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,174
hopefully, we can have later--
but quickly, by opening

418
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,301
yourself up to this
channeling experiences,

419
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,637
has it been a positive
influence in your life?

420
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,430
>> Oh, definitely.

421
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,764
>> OK.

422
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,181
>> Yeah.

423
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:37,973
Yeah.

424
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,475
I can't imagine not doing it.

425
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,809
To me, it's normal.

426
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,685
>> Got you.

427
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,771
>> And I always say it's
going to be the new normal--

428
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,563
>> Sure.

429
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,691
>> --because it's just expanding
the connection that's already

430
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,484
there.

431
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,944
We're never disconnected
from anyone or anything.

432
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,156
So it's just kind of opening
up to what's already around us

433
00:17:54,156 --> 00:18:00,037
and using what's available
to us, the tools.

434
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,873
And I think the guides
are going to get into it--

435
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,292
and I'm already hearing they
are-- but part of it's

436
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,962
understanding why we're here
in 3D, the purpose of 3D,

437
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,464
the playground.

438
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,551
And its opening back up to
other potentials and other games

439
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,096
that we can also participate in.

440
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,888
>> Excellent.

441
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,017
Well, with that said, can
we introduce the Pleiadians?

442
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,851
>> Sure.

443
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,229
>> And can we start asking
some of those questions?

444
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,021
>> Sure.

445
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:26,814
>> Excellent.
