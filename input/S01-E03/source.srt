1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,284
So I'm Nora Herold. I know

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,579
a lot of you are familiar with my work. For those

3
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,582
of you who are meeting me for the first time,

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,085
I've been channeling consciously

5
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,379
for about 20 years.

6
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,302
Um, but for all of my life, I was hearing things

7
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,263
and feeling things and seeing things and

8
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,766
knowing things and I didn't

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,768
have a context for it.

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,519
I didn't understand it.

11
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,483
Oftentimes it felt distracting and overwhelming.

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,110
I didn't really understand that it could be

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,197
an experience that would support or contribute to

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,990
my reality.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,243
And then in 1996 I found myself in

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,329
a ball on the floor.

17
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,084
At the age of 29 years old, going through my Saturn return,

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,628
my first Saturn return.

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:31,174
And I was depressed and had gone

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,385
through a very dramatic breakup and felt

21
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,388
brokenhearted.

22
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,477
And you know the beautiful thing about heartbreak

23
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,480
is it opens us all up.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,234
And in that very open space I was

25
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,904
hanging out with a dear friend one night who read

26
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,156
tarot cards as I also read tarot cards.

27
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:59,285
I'd read tarot cards for years. I'd played with crystals. You know,

28
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,081
I'd started to tune in consciously at

29
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
about the age of 20.

30
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,670
She mentions that she had met a woman recently who

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,505
channeled her spirit guides.

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,424
And that woman was Wendy Kennedy. So this is back

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,804
in Chicago back in 1996. And I said oh

34
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,432
I think that's what I'm looking for. And why don't

35
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,185
we try? And she said great, I've been trying and she'd

36
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,937
had some luck,

37
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,190
feeling something. But when the two of us sat down together that night

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,778
with the intention to connect it happened almost immediately.

39
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,658
I felt the presence of a being

40
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,869
that was so loving,

41
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
so calming,

42
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,793
and so nurturing to me. It was unlike anything

43
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
I had ever experienced as Nora

44
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,881
before.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,969
And it was very quick moment. I felt his

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,972
love. I felt his energy as male and

47
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,974
I knew his name started with an M.

48
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,271
And then the tube on Amy's television blew

49
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,063
out.

50
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:16,279
As Amy was also having her own connection experience. And then very

51
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,490
shortly afterwards, she and I got together with Wendy, and that was my first

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,493
meeting with Wendy Kennedy. And Wendy, Amy,

53
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,162
and I channeled together

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,291
for play, for fun, for quite some time. That was how

55
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,878
we spent our evenings was hanging out channeling for

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,298
each other, channeling for our friends, you know,

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,468
we didn't go to bars and get drunk. We stayed in my apartment, my little

58
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,471
basement apartment in Chicago and ate cookies

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,472
and channeled.

60
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,559
And then at some point it became clear that

61
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,480
this was the service work that

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,898
I was here to do.

63
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,486
So it is now what I do. It's what I've done for a very long

64
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,781
time and my work has evolved over the years. I channel many

65
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,368
different beings. The Pleiadian Collective

66
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,287
is primary right now in my channeling work

67
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,374
and then Yeshua and Calliandra are close behind,

68
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,377
and then behind them the Lyrans and the

69
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,463
archangels and all the other beings. And

70
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,466
so many beings participate when we channel, you

71
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,594
know, it's funny, you know listening to Shelley bring through Gabriel

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,098
and I could feel all the other energies braiding in

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,432
and working through her as well.

74
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,435
It's true for everyone I listened to yesterday,

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,230
so the same will happen today. What I

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,190
recommend for all of you

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,025
is that you really...

78
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,070
allow yourselves to recognize

79
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,283
your own experience of channeling while I'm

80
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,951
channeling today.

81
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,454
Because to be able to receive channeled information in any

82
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,582
format means that your channeling.

83
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,168
Doesn't matter that's coming out of my mouth.

84
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,756
You're acting as the receivers for the information as well. Okay, I'm

85
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,174
going to sit down now.

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:11,060
I'm gonna straighten myself out here. How's my hair? Okay. Now

87
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,147
now Nora will quiet down. I'll

88
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,482
tell you that when I channel. I'm very present.

89
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,987
So you may hear from me again during the channeling portion. Okay?

90
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,495
(Oming sounds)

91
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,960
Ahhhhh.....

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,299
Fantastic!

93
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,596
Greetings, this is the Pleiadian Collective and as always

94
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,059
it is so wonderful to connect with all of you

95
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,062
beautiful universal beings of

96
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,688
light and love, look at you all.

97
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,398
Look at your beauty!

98
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,067
Look at your light!

99
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,780
Look at the beauty in the projection of

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,283
your light bodies into your

101
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,079
physical reality, see yourselves right

102
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,625
now as the beautiful beings you are.

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,377
Both beings of light,

104
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,465
beings holding physical density. Feel your

105
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,883
bodies, put your hands on your body.

106
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:25,885
Yeah.

107
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,473
Put your hands somewhere that particularly you don't like.

108
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,477
Alright, find a find a place on your body that you

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,272
perhaps might not think is so beautiful. Alright, and just

110
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,273
breathe.

111
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,485
And connect.

112
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,949
This is your light!

113
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,954
What you're touching right now

114
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,873
is you,

115
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,750
your light.

116
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,254
You are love

117
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,047
incarnate.

118
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,466
You are nothing else.

119
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
All around you

120
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,558
is love incarnate, nothing else.

121
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,770
Doesn't matter what it looks like, feels like,

122
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,648
the costume it's wearing.

123
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,568
Love incarnate, the table,

124
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,069
the chair,

125
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,449
the ceiling, the walls, the air, the atmosphere,

126
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,456
the Republican, the Democrat, the Illuminati.

127
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,170
Yeshua, us, you, love incarnate.

128
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,882
Love playing a game. That's all this is.

129
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
And that's all there is

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,971
to the idea of awakening from within.

131
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,974
And as we look at all of you,

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,062
what we see: all of you here in this room, all

133
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,274
of you listening in, all of you tuning in at

134
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,650
a later date,

135
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,944
is you're already awake.

136
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,449
Right?  Who in the room feels awake?

137
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,076
Yes.

138
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,873
And yet you continue to awaken.

139
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,459
Because this is the game.

140
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,797
You wake up, you remember right? You all remember

141
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,092
that? Yes, remember when you woke up? Everyone here had some

142
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,095
sort of an awakening moment. It may have

143
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,474
been very small. It may have been gigantic. It really

144
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,769
doesn't matter, every single one of you at some point

145
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,980
came in awake,

146
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,068
went back to sleep, because that's what happened, for all

147
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,071
of you. Most of the children coming in now, they don't have

148
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
to go through this, you know.

149
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,159
They're not going back to sleep as you all did.

150
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,871
Sometimes they take little naps, alright?

151
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,874
They forget for a bit of time who they are

152
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,961
and then it's very easy for them to wake themselves up and remember. But

153
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,795
you all,

154
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,674
you came into an incredibly dense environment awake

155
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,969
and then went back to sleep because that

156
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,597
was the game plan. That's the program. You weren't

157
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,891
supposed to remember

158
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:23,062
throughout the totality of this incarnation

159
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,982
that you are love incarnate.

160
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,443
You were supposed to come in, forget that,

161
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,362
throw on a costume,

162
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,032
create a whole bunch of drama for yourselves,

163
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,286
work through a myriad of issues,

164
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,996
traumas,

165
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,582
most of which have nothing to do with this incarnation.

166
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,170
Alright so think about that piece right now. Anytime you've given

167
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,882
yourself something to work on in this lifetime, what

168
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,885
you've also been doing and the main reason

169
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,097
you gave yourselves those things to

170
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,767
work on, is you've been clearing up with yourselves all

171
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,895
of these unhealed traumas from all of

172
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,898
these other lifetimes, that didn't happen in the past,

173
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,275
that are happening right now,

174
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,777
because all is now, right?

175
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,698
Every version of you that you see is a past life version of you, is

176
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,784
truly existing right now in a

177
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,996
moment in time, currently experiencing whatever pain,

178
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,291
whatever loss, whatever grief, whatever anger, whatever

179
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,294
hurt, whatever anguish, etc. And throughout this

180
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,297
incarnation you have picked up again

181
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,383
and again and again and again these pieces

182
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,595
of your oversoul that

183
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,890
are sitting in distress. You have interacted with

184
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,682
them,

185
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,686
sent them transmissions of unconditional love as you

186
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,273
have worked on your own stuff.

187
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,486
And suddenly you find yourself then to be a much more powerful, clear,

188
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,072
and sovereign being.

189
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,201
Ever wonder if there's intelligent

190
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,619
life elsewhere in the universe?

191
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,498
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

192
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,833
My name is Reuben Langdon.

193
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:12,213
And on March 29th, 2007, in the middle of the day,

194
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,342
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

195
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,843
Coincidentally, I was working on

196
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,096
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

197
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,432
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

198
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,394
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

199
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,105
...are they here with us?

200
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,612
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

201
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,447
...what is their purpose?

202
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,158
Why don't they make themselves more known?

203
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,369
Why the secrecy?

204
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,621
I've asked these questions to many experts,

205
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,290
yet, each seems to have a different theory.

206
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,751
So I thought to myself,

207
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,337
why not ask the aliens directly?

208
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,381
So that's what I set out to do!

209
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,757
Well, sort of...

210
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,312
Nora.

211
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,229
Reuben.

212
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,107
Here we are, thank you for doing this

213
00:12:55,107 --> 00:13:00,112
second time, sort of.  We've been filming you on and off here.

214
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,530
Um.

215
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,825
Can you describe to me

216
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,912
the process of what do you do and

217
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,663
what kind of energies do you tap into

218
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,084
and then hopefully we can tap into them today?

219
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,173
Sure. So I do what's called direct voice channeling.

220
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,759
I also translate, so there are two different

221
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,302
versions of channeling work.

222
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:28,057
Translation is, I listen and receive and then tell

223
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,185
you in my own voice the information

224
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,978
I'm getting and what I hear and often do

225
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,524
that when I work privately in one-on-one sessions

226
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,567
I'll do some translation work

227
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,487
and I'll use my own voice and they've

228
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,075
expressed the importance of us, all of us,

229
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,869
accessing information in a variety of ways.

230
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,788
So that's one of the ways I access

231
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,582
information, but then I also direct voice channel.

232
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,125
So direct voice channel means I

233
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,879
raise my personal vibration to a point

234
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,091
where I can connect up with beings who

235
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,802
exist in a higher dimension, another

236
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,055
vibration, another frequency. They

237
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,183
interact with me telepathically, move

238
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,103
through me energetically, I allow them to

239
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:19,191
alter my vocal cords, speak directly through me.

240
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,610
The beings I work with are

241
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,363
the Pleiadian Collective. So they're a twelfth

242
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,449
dimensional collective of beings that, if

243
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,743
we were going to assign them a location

244
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,913
in our third dimensional version of reality --

245
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,748
Twelfth dimension - how do you even

246
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,252
have that? I mean that's even so far out

247
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,129
of Earthly terms, but...

248
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,718
It's different experience, different flavors along with

249
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,263
that comes different abilities, different awareness.

250
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,892
So when I say twelfth dimensional Pleiadian Collective -

251
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:57,104
they are a gigantic being

252
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:01,567
of love and light, that knows themselves

253
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,154
to be one, and yet understands that they

254
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,699
are comprised of many ones, but they do

255
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,660
not each individuate themselves like we

256
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,913
do here on Earth.

257
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,583
Hence the term 'collective'. So it's not a

258
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,877
specific being in particular.

259
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,379
That's correct, but there are specific beings

260
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,090
I work with as well. So the Pleiadians are

261
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,428
one of many groups and beings I work

262
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,972
with. A specific being would be

263
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,016
Calliandra, she's a fifth dimensional

264
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,186
fairy, so we'll call her a fairy,

265
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,229
that's how she presented

266
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,857
herself to me. I also work with Yeshua.

267
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,776
I see Yeshua to be a collective being,

268
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,570
but we know that being to be an

269
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,281
individual entity that we call Jesus

270
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,992
on this planet. But I know that

271
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,453
energy to be a collective energy.

272
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,163
Or the Archangel Michael at times will come

273
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,875
through me, the Lyrans, beings from

274
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,712
Lemuria, the Zeta's have made contact

275
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,673
with me. It's a very in-the-moment

276
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,759
process for me, but the majority of the

277
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,344
information I'm accessing at this time

278
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,013
is coming from the Pleiadians, Yeshua,

279
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,557
and Calliandra, those are kind of the big three for me.

280
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,018
And are you, you're

281
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,689
present in your awareness when

282
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,732
this happens, it's not like you conk out

283
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,485
and then and then you wake up and I go,

284
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,278
what happened? I've seen that,

285
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,239
I've seen people who have channeled and

286
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,117
that's taking place.

287
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,743
Yes, so what you're talking about there is

288
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,454
trance channeling. Trance channeling? Yes. What I do is

289
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,207
called conscious channeling and/or

290
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,960
semi-conscious channeling. And you

291
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,503
can even see a difference in me when I'm

292
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,131
fully conscious and then when I'm semi-conscious.

293
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,967
So has that happened to you in the past?

294
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,803
Yes. So the fully conscious channeling is more that,

295
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,888
okay, I'm accessing the information, I'm gonna

296
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,348
give it to you right now: Reuben,

297
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
they're telling me: blah blah blah blah blah blah.

298
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,894
So that's almost like, when you work with clients --

299
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:01,729
Yes.

300
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,064
Hearing it and kind of translating it --

301
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,151
And then I will go into a semi-conscious state

302
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,403
with clients as well where then I allow the

303
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,947
Pleiadians, Yeshua, whomever in the moment

304
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,658
to directly work through my body.

305
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,289
Is there...you must resonate with all the

306
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,957
different frequencies otherwise they wouldn't

307
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,126
be coming through. Do you have a favorite?

308
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,506
Or can you not say?

309
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,676
Do I have a favorite? Depends on the day?

310
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,387
Yeah, it's really, it's the

311
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,681
Pleiadians, Calliandra, and Yeshua. I could

312
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,434
not pick one of those out of the three.

313
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,480
However, I'm aware that I have a very

314
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,857
specific contract with the Pleiadians.

315
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,944
And I believe that's why they're

316
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,654
predominantly coming through right now

317
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,073
and I've really noticed that over the

318
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,534
last year especially when I go into the

319
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,495
semi-conscious direct voice channeling

320
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,372
state, it's mostly the Pleiadians

321
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,333
transmitting and then occasionally

322
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,960
Yeshua, Calliandra, the others, the Lyrans,

323
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,047
Lemurians. In the past there used to

324
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,090
be more of a variety in my work, so I'm

325
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,427
very aware that for now, maybe we'll

326
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,096
say the Pleiadians are my favorite.

327
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:23,811
Sorry, Calliandra. Sure she understands. Oh she understands,

328
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,271
but she's like this right now.

329
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,653
Well, maybe we can give her some time to voice as well.

330
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,408
Well, in addition to being a channeler,

331
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,744
or maybe this goes hand in

332
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,455
hand, because you're also clairvoyant or

333
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,958
a clairaudient or is that kind of one and the same?

334
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,964
So language is very interesting because we use it to

335
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,592
help us understand and label and then we can

336
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,137
often then limit and categorize.

337
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,307
Channels will use their clairvoyant,

338
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,059
their clairaudient, they're clairsentient

339
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,853
abilities to help them access

340
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:10,148
information. Yes, I am also as Nora

341
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,986
however, very intuitive, psychic,

342
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,572
clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient.

343
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,740
That's a little bit different from channeling.

344
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,995
Yes, that's me using my own operating system.

345
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,164
So and you have those abilities as well. Awesome.

346
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,626
Because I've talked with other, I guess,

347
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:34,798
intuitive people, in quotes, where to me

348
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,092
and after hearing the process, it sounds

349
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,510
like they were just tapping into like

350
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,762
more channel type you know.

351
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,016
Well, it wasn't me, it was I heard a voice and

352
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,977
this is this is what I'm getting, and you

353
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
know, most the time it's accurate so.. But

354
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,858
I just wondered how your operating system works?

355
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,318
Yes, and really when it

356
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,612
comes down to it, it's all information

357
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,655
coming from source energy. Whether you

358
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,824
access it directly in your own body or

359
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,243
you access it from a vibration or a

360
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,913
frequency outside of you. We are all

361
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,497
source, we are all that love energy

362
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,543
incarnate. It's just fun to get to do it

363
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,086
different ways. That's one of the gifts

364
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,380
of being here on planet Earth, we get the

365
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,132
variety and the selection.

366
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,844
And you know and yeah getting to that and maybe

367
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,721
this is a question later for the

368
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,557
Pleiadians, but by giving it these

369
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,729
labels, is that just more because I've

370
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,689
noticed some people who are new to the

371
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,567
intuitive side of things they're

372
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,194
feeling energies, they're hearing it, but they

373
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,071
don't, maybe they don't know how to

374
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,906
categorize them right or is it

375
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,367
even appropriate to categorize it?

376
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,578
How does that, you know how does that all--

377
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,829
when ultimately we're trying to get

378
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,164
to a place where we're not labeling

379
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,583
anything at all. How does that help us

380
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,251
and does that serve us?

381
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,464
I think it helps initially to label, categorize, to help

382
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,842
the mental body catch up and understand

383
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,470
what it is you're already doing in your

384
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,514
emotional and energetic and physical

385
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,267
bodies and then once you achieve that

386
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,644
level of understanding, it's very

387
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,270
important to release the labels and the

388
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,106
attachments and just be in the moment.

389
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,817
Because then your mind has relaxed. So

390
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,527
the mental body was really set up to

391
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,612
filter out the third dimensional mental

392
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,281
body. Was set up to filter out all of

393
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,576
this input, all of this information.

394
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,329
Zoe, you're now part of the movie, officially.

395
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:35,085
So this is Zoe. Zoe is an elf and a

396
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,380
unicorn. We like to call Zoe the Alphacorn

397
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,174
because she brings through the

398
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,094
elfin and the unicorn energies strongly

399
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,596
in our space.

400
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,560
We have a couple of cats, one is bringing through

401
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,687
the fairy vibration and the other

402
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,982
Pleiadian frequency and vibration. Animals,

403
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
they are definitely helping us here on

404
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,738
so many levels. We've had Zoe now for

405
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,616
just a little over a year and she has

406
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
brought with her such an amazing

407
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,788
transmission of unconditional love and

408
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,375
fun and play, our entire reality has

409
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,629
shifted with her presence.

410
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:24,009
I've noticed that with animals, if humans

411
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,635
could operate on an animal level in so many

412
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,638
ways that you know where we... it's

413
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,807
like they do something and we're mad at

414
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,643
them but then they're in the doghouse so

415
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,188
to say, but two minutes later they're: oh

416
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,939
I didn't do anything, or

417
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,441
I forgive you or whatever. You know they

418
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,569
can't, even if you are physically angry

419
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,946
with them or something, they'll you know:

420
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,699
it's okay, the ultimate show of how to forgive.

421
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,993
Yes. And also how to be present.

422
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,663
They're extremely in the moment, they don't

423
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,374
tie their moments together

424
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,209
in the way that we do and

425
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,668
they also don't filter out the

426
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,629
information that our mental bodies

427
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,964
filter out. Coming back to, back around to

428
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,300
that -- thank you, Zoe -- so I'm aware that

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,012
Zoey and Izzy and Ursula the Smurf, our

430
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,807
cats, are always interacting with the

431
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,600
beings that are present in our space.

432
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,727
I see them watching the beings and seeing

433
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,314
things that I can't access in the moment.

434
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,608
Excellent. Well thanks guys, let us know

435
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,319
if something pops in here, maybe we'll catch it on film.

436
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:31,410
Well, I guess the last question before we move in

437
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:36,331
is: when you were trying to find labels I

438
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,874
guess, or if you weren't even

439
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,960
trying but did

440
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,878
they present themselves and say I am

441
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,256
such and such, I am Pleiadian Collective,

442
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,551
I am Calliandra. Is that how it happened or

443
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,304
were you able to... how did that come

444
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,515
to you, for each? So initially it wasn't

445
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,267
that easy. Okay yeah, that's what I figured,

446
00:23:55,267 --> 00:24:00,188
I knew there'd be a story to this. With the Pleiadians it

447
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,649
was easy. Immediately I recognized that

448
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,901
the transmission from the Pleiadians as

449
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,987
a Pleiadian transmission.

450
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,240
I recognized it in my body, in a visceral

451
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,243
way. It was very clear to me that's who I

452
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,162
was in contact with, and I'd been aware

453
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,039
of the Pleiadian energy so my

454
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,543
mental body had already accepted the

455
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,920
truth of the Pleiadian Collective and

456
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,715
their work with us here on Earth. So when

457
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,342
they made direct contact with me,

458
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,052
my mental body didn't freak out and try to

459
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,180
screen out that piece of information, it

460
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,266
was clear to me. Now many of the other

461
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,893
beings that I've worked with, it's taken

462
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,189
me some time to kind of work my way into

463
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,399
discerning who it was I was connecting

464
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,068
with. Now when I say time, I mean perhaps

465
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,323
a matter of minutes or hours, yes. It's

466
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,867
never been longer than that and that's

467
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,493
just I guess part of my operating system.

468
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,246
Calliandra, for instance, when she first

469
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,708
made herself known to me, I felt a new

470
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,418
being link up with me -- I was preparing

471
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,503
for radio interview that night -- I could

472
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,006
feel this really wonderful playful

473
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,925
presence, and immediately I knew it to be

474
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,637
fairy. So again Nora had accepted fairies,

475
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,139
that was easy, ah I know this vibration to

476
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:21,686
be fairy. So I asked for a name and

477
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,523
I got the name initially Calliana. So I was

478
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,944
playing with Calliana, I was like okay, and

479
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,029
I thought no, that's not quite right, and

480
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,615
then I got Calliandra -- got it.

481
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,993
As soon as I heard, felt, that's really

482
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,205
predominantly how I access information

483
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,250
when I'm not in the semi-conscious

484
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,545
direct voice channeling state, ok? So when

485
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,381
Nora is conscious and awake,

486
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,883
and when I choose to seek out

487
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,426
information

488
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,013
as Nora, meaning information I can't just

489
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,725
read from a book or you know, I feel it

490
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,937
and I hear it. I hear the words. I see it.

491
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
I see it sometimes like words on the

492
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,692
paper. I see the story. Very occasionally

493
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,570
I access more of my clairvoyant

494
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,031
abilities, meaning I will see an image,

495
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:19,286
I'll see some light, I'll see a story

496
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,580
playing out in my mind's eye. So I felt,

497
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,708
heard, the name Calliandra and thought okay

498
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,294
her name is Calliandra. And then I had to

499
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,670
go outside and ground myself because I

500
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,422
was working with a new vibration, a new

501
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,799
frequency and I found it actually really

502
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,634
powerful and intense to work with a

503
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,720
fifth dimensional being. So I was used to

504
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,596
working with these very, very high

505
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,474
vibrations and high frequencies which

506
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,727
were in some ways easier to work with

507
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,022
because it's so... well, any of you

508
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,523
listening right now, if you just take a

509
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,402
breath, you can tune into that

510
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,698
light high, high vibration. Imagine it's

511
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,952
like interacting with a cloud, yes, gentle

512
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,748
easy, right. Calliandra was like

513
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,250
interacting with a sledgehammer, her

514
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,128
energy was so powerful because she has

515
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,881
more density to her vibration as a fifth

516
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,049
dimensional being. So I had to go outside

517
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,925
and stand on the ground. And then I came

518
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,594
in and sat in front of my computer and I

519
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,012
thought I'm gonna look up the word

520
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,806
Calliandra and see what I find, because I

521
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:26,644
like to also, if I can, back up my other

522
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,146
dimensional information with third

523
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,273
dimensional information and I googled

524
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,067
the word Calliandra, and it's a plant

525
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,070
called Fairy Duster and I'd not ever heard

526
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,822
that word before and

527
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,866
it was such a moment of validation for

528
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,409
me, which was great. I was gonna go on the

529
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,119
radio that night and introduce a new

530
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,413
being, so how wonderful that I got that.

531
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,833
So the information you got was

532
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,378
Calliandra the fairy and then the

533
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,922
validation was caught under the name...

534
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,757
So that took me a couple of hours to

535
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,717
answer that question and discerning

536
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,552
frequencies and vibrations. Sometimes

537
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,179
when I'm working with a client and someone who's

538
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,225
passed, connects up with me, you know

539
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,935
sometimes I'll feel immediately like oh

540
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,978
this is their mother whose passed. And

541
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,439
that's work that I don't do a lot of

542
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,692
but I do do it occasionally when it's

543
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,152
necessary. They will present themselves

544
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,530
to me and then typically I'll just ask

545
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,948
them questions of the client you know

546
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,866
where's your mother is usually how I'll

547
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,662
start, as opposed to I've made contact

548
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,705
with your mother, because that can be

549
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,959
startling for somebody who's lost...

550
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,463
But how about so-called dark

551
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:40,510
energies or even manipulating tricksters

552
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,138
or these kinds of, you know, what we see

553
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,807
typically in the movies...

554
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,892
Actually this whole experience, you know,

555
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,521
channeling, has kind of been made quite

556
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,024
negative in our media and with you

557
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,235
know, like "The Exorcist" and these kinds

558
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,654
of things. So I've interacted especially

559
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,281
when I first started channeling,

560
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,825
had a couple of interactions with

561
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:08,163
energies that felt, that seemed to be

562
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,207
wanting to guide, and seemed to be wanting

563
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,877
to give information and so initially it

564
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,671
was interesting and then, what I found

565
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,382
happening was I started feeling afraid.

566
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,802
Not of the being itself but of the

567
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,429
information they were giving me, it was

568
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,223
causing me to feel afraid. Afraid that I

569
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,558
wasn't going to have what I wanted in my

570
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,685
life, afraid that I wasn't really

571
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,730
powerful. So that's.. then I become aware,

572
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,858
oh I'm accessing another vibrational

573
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,401
energy that I don't want to be playing

574
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,820
with. And then I would just.. And that's

575
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,405
how you could kind of discern

576
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,116
which energy is there, just if it's

577
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,160
doing some..., if it's putting you in a

578
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,662
fear-based state. If you're accessing

579
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,040
an energy and you start to feel bad in

580
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,875
your body, it's not really an energy you

581
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,294
want to be playing with. So the thing to

582
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,754
do then is to just send a big

583
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,215
transmission of unconditional love to

584
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,092
that being, and raise your own

585
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,220
vibration. That clears the being out of

586
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,097
your space, it raises your energy. Then

587
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,725
you're able to reconnect with those

588
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,310
higher vibrational beings, and then you

589
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,354
can always - as well, if you're already channeling,

590
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,689
so if you're familiar with the process, you

591
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,983
can call on a being that you know to be

592
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,777
of a higher vibrational nature that

593
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,779
you're familiar with, to kind of

594
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:27,742
reconnect, solidify those connections.

595
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,078
I've heard of cases where

596
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,748
energies start out good, it's almost like

597
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,000
almost like the church, you know start

598
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,210
out good, with good love and light

599
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,797
messages and get people in and then

600
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:45,385
somewhere down the path the

601
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,303
message can kind of turn and then start

602
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,847
putting people in a fear-based situation

603
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,350
and then usually after they get a bunch

604
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,768
of people kind of already in, and you know

605
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,521
very much like a church type scenario.

606
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,856
Well the other issue that you're

607
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,150
touching on here is, you know as a

608
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,697
channel, you still have an ego. So

609
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,366
often what will happen is, in those

610
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,744
situations, the energy itself stays in

611
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,080
that high vibrational state - it's the

612
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,624
filter that alters, meaning the channel.

613
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,335
So I'm constantly checking my

614
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,838
filter. I'm constantly having to

615
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:26,634
disengage from any personal intention

616
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,761
or attachment to anything personally for

617
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,514
Nora, while channeling, or the person I'm

618
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,100
channeling for. So if I were channeling

619
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,060
for you, Reuben, in a private session and

620
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,313
I had a particular desire for you, for

621
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,565
your success let's say? If I was attached

622
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,318
to that, that would cloud my ability to

623
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,986
clearly discern the information that's

624
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,654
coming through and I'd put my own spin on it.

625
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,157
So what you're talking about

626
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,701
I think are those cults that have come up

627
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,411
around channels and things like that,

628
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,497
it's, you know, there's an imperative

629
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,333
underneath that the channel was running

630
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,711
for a prosperity issue or relationship

631
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,671
issue or sexual issue or whatever it is.

632
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,258
And suddenly 'the being' is recommending

633
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,218
everyone hand over their money,

634
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,140
when really, it's the channel speaking and

635
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,392
the being has no control over that.

636
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,978
So that's the other wonderful thing

637
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,981
about this co-creative work in channeling.

638
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:28,237
I can only bring through what I

639
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,241
allow myself to bring through. They can't

640
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:36,621
force me to do anything. So I can

641
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,083
alter the message, really, any time I want.

642
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,877
You really have to keep yourself in check though?

643
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,755
Yeah - and I have a lot of

644
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,590
lessons that I've experienced in this

645
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,135
lifetime to remind me to keep myself in check.

646
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,932
I'm sure they're guiding and helping you do that.

647
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,058
Yes, yes.

648
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,768
As long as you're paying attention.

649
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,980
And I guess when those others, that

650
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,690
we talked about, probably aren't paying

651
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,109
attention or you know they're not,

652
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,653
I'm sure those higher beings are

653
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,072
probably screaming at them and

654
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,616
then the ego kicks in and tunes them out.

655
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,660
I think those things happen for

656
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,622
karmic reasons or because they've got

657
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,624
trauma they haven't resolved, and that

658
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:26,129
trauma begins to spin this tale.

659
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,463
But the other thing you've got to look at here

660
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,507
is anybody who gets pulled in by

661
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,884
something like that, they are a

662
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,469
co-creator in that experience as well.

663
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,763
They are willingly handing over

664
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,726
their free will to that entity or that

665
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,477
higher being and that's their lesson as

666
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,938
well. So then the channel who's bringing

667
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,732
through the information in that way with

668
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,526
their own, perhaps, distorted filter

669
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,946
is suddenly serving to offer this lesson to

670
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,073
anybody who wants to hand over their

671
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,492
free will and forget they're sovereign.

672
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,703
Man, so many people hand over that free will so easily.

673
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,706
Well, we're also programmed

674
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,249
to be enslaved, so we really...

675
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,126
Is that a DNA programming, you think, or is that..?

676
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,045
It's in our genetic code and it's

677
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,214
something that we're in the process of

678
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,885
rewriting as we integrate our higher

679
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,845
selves because our higher selves don't

680
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,598
have that imperative to run the

681
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,641
enslavement games.

682
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,189
They don't have genetics, do they?

683
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,649
Well, they don't but, as we're integrating our

684
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,068
higher selves into our third dimensional

685
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,821
chakra system, our higher selves are

686
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,158
interacting with our physical genetic

687
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,161
structure.  Now I'm a bit

688
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,121
going into the channeling state, so I'm

689
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,457
not fully direct voice channeling, but if

690
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,833
you're paying attention to me you're

691
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,043
going to see I look a little different

692
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,503
right now because my eyes are starting

693
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,548
to get a, have a different focus, so the

694
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,717
Pleiadians are just reminding us right

695
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,511
now that as we integrate our higher

696
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,639
selves we are altering ourselves from

697
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,141
the inside out physically, genetically as

698
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,686
well and we're breaking down... Greetings!

699
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,647
This is the Pleiadians Collective as

700
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,067
always, it's wonderful to have the

701
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,735
opportunity to link up with you in this

702
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,487
way, and we'll give you back Nora if you need

703
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,948
her again? No this is a good transition.

704
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,824
