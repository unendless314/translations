1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,428
If you're the type of person that

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,764
is only going outside and

3
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:18,101
sitting under the stars to 
be able to

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,730
see a ship and have no
spiritual experience at all

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,315
but just be able to touch
the ship...

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:30,196
Then your consciousness is staying 
in this level so to speak

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,199
below the spaces.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,287
Now there's lots of UFO
hunters out there in the

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:37,829
world,

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,666
who are experiencing contact
from that perspective

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,377
but we can say it's not very 
satisfying.

12
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,673
So when we do this work
with you

13
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,966
what we're doing

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,052
is helping to give you tools to

15
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:58,558
make it easier for you to pass through 
those spaces between the film.

16
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,562
And when you pass through 
and you move into a more

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,190
expanded reality, that's when 
the weird stuff starts happening.

18
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:11,738
Stuff that doesn't adhere to the 
definitions of physical reality

19
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,199
that can be exciting for some people,

20
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,576
it can be scary for others.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,065
Ever wonder if there's intelligent

22
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,483
life elsewhere in the universe?

23
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,362
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

24
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,697
My name is Reuben Langdon.

25
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:59,077
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

26
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,206
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,707
Coincidentally, I was working on

28
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,960
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

29
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,296
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,258
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

31
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,969
...are they here with us?

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,476
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

33
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,311
...what is their purpose?

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,022
Why don't they make themselves more known?

35
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,233
Why the secrecy?

36
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,485
I've asked these questions to many experts,

37
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,155
yet each seems to have a different theory.

38
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,615
So I thought to myself,

39
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,201
why not ask the aliens directly?

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,245
So that's what I set out to do!

41
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,621
Well, sort of...

42
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,066
>>  Um, we have...

43
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,651
I feel like, you know, again, looking in

44
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,862
our sky we have, you know, we have

45
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,572
the Draconian way of doing things, we

46
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,990
have the Pleiadian way of doing things,

47
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,409
the Sirian way of doing things,

48
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,705
the Sassani,  the Yahyel, the ... You know, all

49
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,125
of these different ways.  And, and ,

50
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,294
>> Because you know, when 
you're, when you're looking at

51
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,882
consciousness as it is expressed
in 3rd density or even early 4th

52
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:24,264
density, you can still see the idea of
separate paths - the Draconian

53
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,474
way or the Pleiadian way or the Sirian way.

54
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,266
>> Right.

55
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:32,313
>>But actually as you move farther and 
farther into 4th density, the paths

56
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:37,402
become a big... a much wider road 
that contains them all, and that's when

57
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,240
you start to see the path has always 
been the same, it just was shaped and

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,828
smelled differently, so to speak...
but it's always been the same path.

59
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:53,209
>>So in your guys' evolution.... state right 
now, you sort of just are maybe

60
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:59,173
more awoken to that idea, that the path is
the same and therefore it...

61
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,009
>> It doesn't matter...

62
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,219
>> And our perception it may look like we 
have all these choices...

63
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:03,886
>> Exactly...

64
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,598
>> but in reality we're just going to end 
up going the one that we're gonna feel

65
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,307
excited about.

66
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,561
>> Exactly, and of course my reality
structure is very different, so when

67
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:18,067
children are born in my world we know
right away what their path is, what their

68
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,070
highest excitement is, as you've said.

69
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,870
And that is nurtured, and the child is 
taught from a very young age to

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,416
express that, and this is one of the 
reasons why in the contact work we do,

71
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:39,255
we often bring children for the contact work with
humans, because those in our society who

72
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,509
will be the future ambassadors of
contact on many worlds,

73
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,847
display those talents and those joys very early on.

74
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,099
>> So you're not forcing everybody to be
a doctor and a lawyer?

75
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,017
>> No,

76
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,559
(laughs)

77
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,977
>> exactly, exactly.

78
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,229
>> And I feel like we're moving out of that.

79
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,399
>> You are moving out of that.  We know 
it doesn't look that way, but you are.

80
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,989
>> When it comes to working with all 
these different energies,

81
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,493
and in past channelings you've talked 
about the Association of Worlds.

82
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,202
>> Yes.

83
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,370
And is your society part of this Association?

84
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,997
>> Yes, yes.

85
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,208
And is...?

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,585
>> It's not like Star Trek.

87
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,087
>> It's not quite like Star Trek, no.

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,963
But Star Trek is a wonderful metaphor for

89
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,840
you to understand it.

90
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,551
>> Right, I get it.

91
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:33,351
And in the Association, you've 
sort of moved out of

92
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,853
battling and wars, and you can't really be

93
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,855
part of the Association if 
you have that sort of

94
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,359
dominating enslavement idea?

95
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,446
>> Yes, however... forgive us for being picky

96
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,491
but we're going to just be picky
about the words.

97
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,536
It's not a matter of "You
can't be in our club,"

98
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,120
>> Okay.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,829
...so to speak.

100
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,705
Literally those who are still in

101
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,042
3rd density still experiencing 
battles and conflicts

102
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,420
simply don't resonate with 
the idea that we are.

103
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,672
>> Okay.

104
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,467
And would this be the same 
with higher density Draconian

105
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,678
densities that are, sort of, again,

106
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,764
battling out the Orion war idea?

107
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,144
Are they...?  Did the Association of Worlds

108
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,313
exist during the Orion wars?

109
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,358
>> It was in a different form.

110
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:22,859
>> Okay.

111
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,529
Because the Orion wars were 
really so very long ago,

112
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,321
>> Right.

113
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:33,870
and because of that the only 
"elder species" were few and far between.

114
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,663
>> Oh, I see.

115
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,541
>>But it was... they did 
have a version of it,

116
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,086
but even then, it was the

117
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,214
very clear idea that 
you cannot interfere,

118
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:52,555
because all 3rd density species have to 
go through their process, and...

119
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,933
>> So was the Orion wars 
primarily a 3rd density event?

120
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,767
>> Yes.

121
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,563
It was a 3rd density event, 
and it also carried

122
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,650
over into the beginning phases of 4th
density as well...

123
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,150
>> I see...

124
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,988
Until it became impossible to 
maintain the separation any longer.

125
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,199
>>  I see.

126
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,869
Yeah, and again so going 
back to the densities,

127
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:20,583
The idea of higher density 
versions of different races

128
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,835
and I'm gonna...

129
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,338
I keep bringing up the 
Draconians because I feel

130
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,674
there's a lot of resonance

131
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,928
with that archetypal energy 
right now on planet earth,

132
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,348
because we are, we have 
such a mixed bag of that

133
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,936
and we all, you know 
the reptilian DNA is in us,

134
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:46,776
if I'm correct? And we are 
working through those...

135
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,862
that karma so to say.

136
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,949
Karma in a different way...

137
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,741
>> Yes.

138
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,117
... than we're familiar with.

139
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:05,419
So at these higher density 
versions of Draconian energy,

140
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,048
do they still hold those same archetypes

141
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,384
that we're familiar with 
in 3rd density?

142
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,134
>> No.

143
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,594
No.

144
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,472
You're going to find that 
the idea of "battling" ...

145
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,223
>> Yes

146
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,185
>>It wears itself out in the 
early phases of 4th density.

147
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,270
>> Okay.

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,608
>>So when you're talking about
higher-level Draconian

149
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,195
consciousness, it has gone
more into deep

150
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,196
unconditional love.

151
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,198
>> Mmm, okay.

152
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:39,996
So if you go to a 6th - 7th 
density Draconian being,

153
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,581
vast differences between...

154
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,332
>> Oh, yes...

155
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,752
>>between the 3rd density
version.

156
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,212
>> Yes, vast differences.

157
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,088
>> Okay.

158
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,800
Probably we can't even 
conceptualize what that is?

159
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,176
>> Exactly.

160
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,388
But it's still,  it's a very 
unique evolutionary path

161
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,350
very separate from 
the Pleiadian perspective.

162
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,519
>> Yes, exactly.

163
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,813
>>  I see.

164
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:10,818
I've gotten this download.  
I had a visitation from a

165
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,695
Mantis being...

166
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,198
and this goes into...

167
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,701
The download that I got I'm still trying

168
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,454
to digest, and maybe you 
can help me with this?

169
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:26,876
Is that the Draconian energy was

170
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,172
sort of wanting to experience itself,

171
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,967
wanted to evolve past 6th or 7th

172
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,427
density.  That the Draconians, that

173
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,389
energy archetype, sort of had a hard time

174
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,561
going past that density,
that version of existence

175
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,816
because of its grasping 
onto a physical form.

176
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,069
>>To us

177
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,782
because the 4th density
is the last...

178
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,991
>> Oh, that's right!

179
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,576
...in the way we measure

180
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,788
>>There is, once you move into 5th, 
6th, or 7th there

181
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,456
no longer is physical bodies.

182
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,040
>> Okay.

183
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,211
>>Now there have been many species who

184
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:16,550
tried very hard to cling to 
physicality and not move

185
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,303
into the non-physical expression 
in 5th density.

186
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:19,929
>> Maybe that?

187
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,055
>> It could be that...

188
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,223
>> That version.

189
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,226
I guess the main thing I got and I sort of

190
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,478
assumed because of my 
understanding of densities,

191
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,938
but the main thing I got was

192
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,692
the Draconian energy,

193
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:40,157
because of it's resistance to
go into a non-physical reality,

194
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,578
but there was still a portion 
of that energy that wanted

195
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,122
to move in to that...

196
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,081
>> Yes.

197
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,668
...energy. Therefore it called upon the

198
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:56,882
Mantis beings to help move, 
help design a plan,

199
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,302
and that's sort of what 
humanity was, is,

200
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,639
is a plan to help move that
consciousness into

201
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,268
a non-physical reality, evolution.

202
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,730
I don't know if that makes any sense?

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,190
>> Well you, but you brought something

204
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,900
up that is very key here.

205
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,526
>> Okay.

206
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,362
And you're calling 
them Mantis beings.

207
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:18,696
>> Sure.

208
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,782
>>We call them Founders, same idea and

209
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,701
if we can...

210
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,454
we'll just give you our 
definition of them from

211
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,580
the bigger picture.

212
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,122
>> Mmm-um

213
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:33,002
>>So when the one consciousness 
began its fragmentation

214
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,715
that eventually became the souls 
that have the individual lives.

215
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,969
One of the first fragments from the Source

216
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:46,098
was a collective, beings that we call

217
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,100
Founders, that are kind of the architects.

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,642
>> Mmm - um

219
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:55,357
>>and when humans feel or 
perceive their energy,

220
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,611
they see them as Mantis or
insectoid,

221
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,571
that's one of the ways they appear.

222
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:00,905
>> Right.

223
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:09,205
>>Another way they appear are 
the very tall willowy beings that...

224
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,539
>> Was this Barbara Lamb's ...?

225
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,000
>> Yes, the spring onion beings,

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,084
Founder beings.

227
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,419
>> Perfect, okay that

228
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,629
ok, makes sense now.

229
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,549
>> Yes, and so these beings 
known as the architects,

230
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,844
are overseeing so to speak

231
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,723
the building of the structure 
of the physical stage play,

232
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:33,771
let's say, and so whenever 
a civilization or a species

233
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,815
gets "in trouble", so to speak,

234
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,818
we have a tendency to call them for guidance.

235
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,277
>>  Okay.

236
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,657
>>The Orions did, the Pleiades did, 
the Sirians did, the Zetas did,

237
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,033
the Dracos did.

238
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,159
>>  Right okay,

239
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,454
yeah, the Zetas, I got that too that...

240
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,832
Did the Zetas even have the 
technology to travel

241
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,877
inter-dimensionally to our timeline?

242
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:01,006
I don't ... I got that the Mantis 
helped out with that a little bit.

243
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,841
>> Yes.

244
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,511
Zetas though are... 
they are quite unique as

245
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,473
you well know, and because they were able

246
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,811
to harness such intense 
energy of mentality

247
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,855
they could do things in terms

248
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,107
of the traveling through time lines that

249
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,608
no other species could do.

250
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,359
>> Oh really, okay.

251
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,070
So that's one of the reasons 
why too they could do that.

252
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,071
>> Fascinating.

253
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,409
And these Mantis beings often 
in abduction scenarios,

254
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,912
temporary detainment scenarios,

255
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,539
show up sort of in the background.

256
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,541
>> Yes, exactly.

257
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,586
>>And so I'm assuming this 
is probably why,

258
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,421
and seen with many different races too.

259
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,507
Oh, there's a Mantis being 
with a Pleiadian, or...

260
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,385
That is why, they're like overseers.

261
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
>> Fascinating.

262
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,971
And not in a controlling way of course.

263
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,183
>> And are they in a specific
density or they sort of can

264
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,811
manifest in any density depending 
on who's in trouble?

265
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,356
Well, we say primarily
7th density because

266
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,943
even though they're manifesting 
seemingly as "a being"

267
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:08,365
it's really a collective. 
So they cannot manifest

268
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,159
physically, which is one of the

269
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,869
reasons why in a sense,

270
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:17,041
now we're using this figuratively, 
they could "channel through"

271
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,667
more physical beings.

272
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:24,048
So if you have Zetas 
accompanied by a Mantis,

273
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,135
it's not that the Mantis 
is physically there,

274
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,431
but the human is perceiving the energy,

275
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,515
and can interpret it.

276
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,850
>> Right, yeah, my

277
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,311
sort of download was not a physical

278
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,980
interaction, it was more of a data drop.

279
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:40,898
>> Exactly.

280
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,857
At least that's the way it felt.

281
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,274
>> Exactly.

282
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,445
It's very, very unique and I've...

283
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,740
to date it's been my really only

284
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,702
conscious interaction with 
an extraterrestrial presence

285
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,995
in that sense.

286
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,080
Well, how many

287
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,915
days do you have in Sedona coming up?

288
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,749
(laughs)

289
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
Hmm, we'll see about that.

290
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,213
>> Alright, very cool.

291
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,591
There's a lot of talk about 
inner earth beings,

292
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,218
especially recently, it's sort of

293
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:14,974
been in the consciousness, there's been a

294
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,227
whistleblower who's been talking about

295
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,063
interaction with inner earth beings

296
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,024
and we're finding out this new

297
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,526
history that these beings have been

298
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,945
there for millions of years

299
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,699
pre-dating humanity and, sort of,
staying low key.

300
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:37,329
Now, are they, those beings 
4th density beings?

301
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,622
3rd, 4th density beings or...?

302
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,749
>> Mostly 4th density beings.

303
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,208
>> Okay.

304
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,962
There are some that are 5th 
density so they're

305
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,008
not necessarily perceived as 
solid objects in space, but

306
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,136
as light energy, and they're much like what

307
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,971
we said about the Anunnaki, they're really

308
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,890
a collective, a collective of races.

309
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,516
>> Okay.

310
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,768
So yes, so there's many 
different races...

311
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,437
in the inner earth.

312
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,062
>> Yes

313
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,482
And because at different 
densities, different frequencies,

314
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:11,155
if for example, are we only 
now able to perceive them

315
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,782
because we're shifting into this
fourth density?

316
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,491
>> Yes, yes.

317
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,203
>>And if we were to try let's say
 in our past timelines of

318
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:22,916
3rd density,  even a hundred years ago,
if we were to try to burrow into the earth

319
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,587
and try to find these beings, 
we would just hit rocks per se?

320
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,800
>> You would not really have 
the contact except in

321
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,345
the cases of those spontaneous moments

322
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,140
of openness, where you're actually not

323
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,935
digging, so to speak, but you're
open to the contact.

324
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,147
So when Admiral Bird flew over 
the North Pole and saw the

325
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:50,486
big hole and in, you know, then 
we have all these lores

326
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,739
of and stories of journey 
to the center of the earth.

327
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,198
>>  Yes.

328
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,783
You know these these sorts of stories.

329
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,408
>> Yes

330
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,119
So that was just because the 
heart space was in the right

331
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,370
space to go into that.

332
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,373
>> And the timing and 
many many things...

333
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,002
Nexus point of timelines 
many things,

334
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,171
but not necessarily repeatable.

335
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:09,797
>> Okay.

336
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,423
Once the ego gets involved, yes?

337
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,299
>> Right.

338
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,886
Do you guys interact with 
those 4th density beings?

339
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,138
>> Yes there are certain ones

340
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,809
that we do because, you know, humans

341
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,936
this is not aimed at you of course, but

342
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,063
humans have a tendency of thinking they

343
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,940
are the only things 
walking the earth, yes?

344
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,398
>> Right.

345
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:33,529
But the earth is quite populated 
on many levels of other dimensions,

346
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,909
and in the ancient times 
because there were so

347
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,786
many beings on the planet,

348
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,791
and during the times when 
those groups left, many stayed

349
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,002
behind and began to 
build their own colonies.

350
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,131
So you have especially one very

351
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,009
populated colony is what 
we would call Sirians,

352
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,595
ancient Sirians that stayed and

353
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,056
experience their ascension process here...

354
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,473
>> Oh, wow...

355
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,808
... on your planet.

356
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,602
And very often they're seen as blue.

357
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,603
>> Okay.

358
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,523
And on one... so on a specific density

359
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,860
reality they're there.  Yes.  And they...

360
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,569
>> Yes.

361
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,863
>>And they... do they coexist with us?

362
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,572
>> Yes.

363
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,281
>> They do?

364
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,450
>> Yes, and when you are in the space in

365
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,328
your consciousness to connect 
with them you most certainly can.

366
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,080
We've spoke to many who have.

367
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,999
>>  Okay, and do you work with them?

368
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,876
>> Sometimes, yes.

369
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,710
>> Okay.

370
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,131
Especially when we're 
doing contact work in areas

371
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:38,427
where they are active and 
they actually tend to be

372
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,848
active in seismically active places.

373
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,932
>> Oh, okay.

374
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,100
>> Volcanic areas.

375
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,688
>> So their origin is Sirius, 
but then they migrated

376
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,316
to Earth at some point in our history?

377
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,401
>> Their ancestors came here when the

378
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,528
Sirians were here and some of them stayed.

379
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,324
Some of them also... now of course in

380
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,118
the cosmology that we've presented, the

381
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,329
Sirian beings, the Orion beings, the Zeta beings,

382
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,414
they all come from Vega lineage.

383
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,123
>> Okay.

384
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,710
So the very, very ancient Vegas who

385
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,840
colonized Mars, also some stayed behind

386
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,468
came to Earth as well, so that's why

387
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
we say there's a mix.

388
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,095
>> I see.

389
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,015
So is Vega sort of our elders?

390
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,141
>> Yes...

391
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,808
>> In that sense?

392
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,392
>> Yes.

393
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,978
>> What is most known in your galactic

394
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,230
family is what we call Vegan Mysticism,

395
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,399
which is a school of spirituality that

396
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,526
was birthed in Vega millions and

397
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,320
millions and millions of years ago, that

398
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,032
passed to the different civilizations in

399
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,285
your galactic family and 
also seeded on Earth.

400
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,496
So the seeds of it on Earth most

401
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,123
specifically you see within some of the

402
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,377
ancient Sanskrit and Hindu times.

403
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,628
>> Oh, okay.

404
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,215
And various seeds around the world so

405
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,386
it's quite prolific, Vegan Mysticism.

406
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,139
And do... going back to 
the Sirians, did they...?

407
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,351
Were they around during the time of Atlantis?

408
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,228
The ones that stayed here on Earth?

409
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,437
>> Yes, they were.

410
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,898
And so Atlantis... was Atlantis...

411
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,486
I assume it was a mixed density bag of tricks?

412
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,155
>> Yes, mixed density bag and mixed

413
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,784
density... Sorry, and mixed... >>Races?  >>No, a mixed

414
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,122
drama going on.

415
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,622
>> Okay,

416
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,832
lots of things going on.

417
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,834
>> Lots of things going on,

418
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:38,714
and all of us, most of us 
I guess humans have had

419
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:43,468
experiences from or 
simultaneous lifetimes there...

420
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,303
>> Yes...

421
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,762
>> That we're working through that karma now?

422
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,262
>> Yes.

423
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,768
>>And so the Sirians were there
and they...

424
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,146
and then that sort
of event happened,

425
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,480
cataclysms things like this?

426
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,065
>>All sorts of things.

427
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:01,319
>>And if it happened in 
3rd density reality

428
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,280
did it also happen in these other...?

429
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,616
If if there's mixed densities 
interacting with each other

430
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,785
did it happen across the density board,

431
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,871
the cataclysms, the destruction?

432
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,751
>> Ah, we see what you're asking. 
Well when we say "mixed densities"

433
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,753
we have to define that.

434
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,378
>> Okay

435
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,964
>> Right now on Earth you
have mixed densities,

436
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,342
even though it's not... 
you don't see it.

437
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,219
>> Yeah no, we do, we have the, 
the low end of the 3rd,

438
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,388
and the high end of the 3rd,

439
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,806
and the low end of the 4th.

440
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,018
>> Exactly and even... and you have 5th

441
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,437
density versions of yourselves and 6th

442
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,772
because again it's the concentric... it's

443
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,400
the boxes, the concentric nesting boxes.

444
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,737
So in the Atlantean time, physically

445
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,781
speaking you did have a mix of 3rd and

446
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,950
4th density beings in a sense

447
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,536
populating the same space-time,

448
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,456
but you also had the other

449
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,085
non-physical influences as well, so...

450
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,629
And lots of different dramas because

451
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,589
everyone was playing out whatever it was

452
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,383
they needed to play out for their own

453
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,259
evolution.  So it was one of those nexus

454
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:11,181
points of evolution that were very

455
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:16,603
important to, let's say, 
show you the

456
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:21,566
trajectory for the next 
phase of your evolution.

457
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,569
Because you could have, as a

458
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,488
species, shifted at that time.

459
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,243
So I was wondering in our
native cultures, in the past,

460
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,161
we have had--

461
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:38,125
across the world we've had,
obviously, we've had pyramids,

462
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:44,339
and we've had native
cultures with high ideals.

463
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:50,554
Native American Indians,
Peruvian, Amazonian tribes

464
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,765
that have really, when
we look at it now,

465
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:59,479
a highly evolved sense
of being and way of life.

466
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,605
>> Yes.

467
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,693
>> Were those cultures,
where those beings,

468
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,069
at a higher density?

469
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,737
Were they fourth density?

470
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,530
>> Well.

471
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,740
>> Or were they still third?

472
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,284
>> It depends on the era.

473
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,076
>> OK.

474
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,038
>> Because civilizations
have a tendency--

475
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,459
physical civilizations will
have a tendency of cycling from

476
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,253
third to fourth density,
sometimes repeating it.

477
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,045
>> OK.

478
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,591
>> Until the time is
right for the shift.

479
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,383
>> I see.

480
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,217
>> OK.

481
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,554
But you're going to find that
with the indigenous species

482
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,473
on your planet, or
the indigenous races,

483
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:41,188
excuse us, on your planet that
even though they are halfway

484
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,939
around the world
from each other,

485
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,525
your struck by the similarities.

486
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,318
>> Correct.

487
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,447
>> And pyramids and practices
and things such as that.

488
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,073
Two main reasons for this.

489
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:57,329
One is because of the
ET influence, of course.

490
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:03,543
Another is because a lot of
those structures and practices

491
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:10,050
came from Vegan mysticism,
which came to Earth from Mars,

492
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,967
originally.

493
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,760
>> OK.

494
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,764
>> So that's why there is--
if you could really see

495
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,641
the history of
your solar system,

496
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,519
you would see the continuity.

497
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,686
>> Right, the linear--

498
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,980
>> And then, going all
the way back to Vega.

499
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,814
>> I see.

500
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,526
So the Vegans, did
they colonize Mars?

501
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,777
>> Yes.

502
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,112
>> They colonized
Mars very early on.

503
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,282
They colonized Mars
well before the Earth

504
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,992
was even stable for colonies.

505
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,327
>> Oh, OK.

506
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,580
And the destruction of Mars--

507
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,332
I've heard that there was--

508
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,084
some say there was
a nuclear event.

509
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,671
There was-- where--

510
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,340
or is that just because of
the density that we're in,

511
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,175
we perceive it that way?

512
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,009
>> Yes.

513
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,178
Actually, we've given
a session on this,

514
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,348
but Germane, who
gave the session,

515
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,185
has never really spoken
specifically about it.

516
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:07,857
However, what he has said
is that there were a--

517
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,277
there was a series of events.

518
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,321
Some were cataclysmic
with asteroids and things

519
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,155
such as that.

520
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,407
Some were political.

521
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,035
Some things-- so everything, a
perfect storm, you might say.

522
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,371
>> I see.

523
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:25,375
There's the idea or
the talk of Maldek

524
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,961
being a planet within
our solar system

525
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,171
that now makes up
the Kuiper Belt.

526
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,132
>> Yes, yes.

527
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,425
Similar history to Mars.

528
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,217
>> OK.

529
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,845
I was going to say, did Mars
come after the destruction of--

530
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,054
did Mars-- does destruction--

531
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,847
>> It was parallel.

532
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,472
>> Parallel, OK.

533
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,348
>> Yes.

534
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:45,520
>> And then, our moon, did
it come from the Maldek

535
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,564
civilization?

536
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:52,110
Or is that-- because I've
heard different variations

537
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,156
of the moon being
artificial, put into place.

538
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,326
>> It's not artificial, per
se, but it's been, let's say,

539
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,118
terraformed.

540
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,452
>> Terraformed.

541
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:00,785
OK.

542
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,828
>> Yes.

543
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,789
>> Was it native to our planet?

544
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,541
Or was it sort of put there?

545
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,876
>> It was not native.

546
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,336
Let's say, it was a wanderer.

547
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,128
>> OK.

548
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,671
A wanderer and it
found its position.

549
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,464
>> Yes.

550
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,381
>> And it fixed.

551
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:13,798
>> Yes.

552
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,591
>> OK.

553
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:19,596
Was there-- so is
it its own celestial

554
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,889
being with consciousness?

555
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,681
>> Yes.

556
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,015
>> Light?

557
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:22,891
>> Yes.

558
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,935
>> When we think of artificial,
we think that there's been some

559
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,564
sort of outside manipulation--

560
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,024
>> Yes.

561
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:31,983
>> --done to it.

562
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,776
>> Yes.

563
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,237
>> But even that outside
artificial manipulation,

564
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,491
in a way, is still part
of that consciousness.

565
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,283
>> Yes.

566
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,995
>> Like Earth right now, we're
making genetically-modified

567
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,707
foods and chemically enhancing
and doing all kinds of things.

568
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,502
But it's still
naturally artificial.

569
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,294
[LAUGHING]

570
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,420
>> There you go.

571
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,213
Yes.

572
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,673
It doesn't mean
it's not harmful--

573
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,465
>> Right.

574
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,633
>> --necessarily.

575
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,929
But, you know, it's the whole
idea of what consciousness is.

576
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,266
Consciousness
permeates everything,

577
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,562
so can you ever take a slice
and make it not consciousness?

578
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,397
No.

579
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,189
>> I see.

580
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,150
>> It's just a difference of
whether it's dormant or aware

581
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,779
of itself or not.

582
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,572
Now, in terms of
planets, however--

583
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,365
>> Yes.

584
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,702
>> --and especially suns, you're
going to find that what you

585
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:33,128
call the core of the planet
or the sun is an entry point--

586
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,589
exit and entry
point, dimensionally.

587
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:42,637
So this is why celestial
bodies have consciousness.

588
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,223
Because the consciousness,
literally the consciousness

589
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,767
of creation, breathes
itself in and out

590
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,395
through those
portals in the center

591
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,649
of the core of whether
it's a sun or a planet.

592
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,776
So-- and we're talking--

593
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,403
you know, we're not
necessarily talking

594
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,946
about a rock flying in space.

595
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,739
>> Right.

596
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,658
>> We're talking more about
a planetary body that even

597
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,702
perhaps has a slight
gravitational field.

598
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,748
>>That doesn't
necessarily mean the size

599
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,749
of the--

600
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,709
>>Yes it's not really
dictated by size.

601
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,501
>> OK.

602
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,255
>> Because gravity has much
more to it than just the size

603
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,047
factor.

604
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,923
>> OK.

605
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,883
>> OK.

606
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,675
And--

607
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,219
>> More often than not,
you'll see the correlation.

608
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:23,428
>> OK.

609
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,430
>> But it doesn't mean one
is caused by the other.

610
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,763
>> OK.

611
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,056
That's what I thought.

612
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:33,646
And in our sun's case,
as you were saying,

613
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,192
it's sort of a portal
and we're getting--

614
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:42,322
that's our life
force is the sun.

615
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:47,452
Now, if we were to move
to another solar body

616
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,538
galaxy, or solar system, and--

617
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:56,586
would we then shift our being?

618
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,755
Would we no longer become human?

619
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,882
Would we become a new--

620
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,926
because now we're getting
our energy downloads

621
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:07,722
from a new celestial being,
would we become a new species?

622
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,515
>> OK.

623
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,225
So this is definitely
hypothetical.

624
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,017
>> Yes.

625
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,395
>> Because at this point,
humans cannot go and try out--

626
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,230
>> Sure.

627
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,940
>> And try it out, yes.

628
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,026
And also because
of the limitation

629
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,988
of human consciousness to
traverse space right now.

630
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,908
Because right now,
human consciousness

631
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,619
is tied to the
gravitational field

632
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,330
of its planet and its sun.

633
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,168
And this is a metaphor--
a macrocosmic metaphor

634
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,881
for how the ego is the
anchor for you on a planet.

635
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,674
>> OK.

636
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,176
Because the ego is
like a black hole.

637
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,929
Same function, so to speak.

638
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,182
However, as you move into fourth
density, deeper and deeper

639
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,603
into fourth density, and
the anchor that is ego

640
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:00,024
and individuality becomes
metaphorically lighter,

641
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,026
therefore, you're
able, in a sense,

642
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,571
to escape the
gravitational field

643
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,615
and not be influenced
so much by it.

644
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,327
So space travel becomes
no longer traveling

645
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,329
on the surface of space.

646
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,249
It, instead, becomes
traveling through space

647
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:22,463
or becoming one with space in
a very, very different way.

648
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,508
So we had to lay that
groundwork in order

649
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,509
to answer your question.

650
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,302
>> Sure.

651
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,511
OK.

652
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:35,143
>> Right now, if you were to be
picked up and taken to another

653
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:39,480
planet in another solar
system, it would be very,

654
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,775
very hard to make
the adaptation.

655
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,610
>> OK.

656
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,402
>> OK.

657
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,990
But if you were more
deeper into fourth density

658
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,078
in terms of your evolution, thus
your egoic anchor was lighter,

659
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,207
it would be easier for you
to go through a metamorphosis

660
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,878
if you were planted, so to
speak, in another solar system.

661
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,922
It would be easier.

662
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,298
>> And is that--

663
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,217
going to the hybrid
programs for the Zetas--

664
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:15,642
is that-- part of that
creating new beings, so to say,

665
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,144
and populating new planets
and new star systems,

666
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,898
or new solar systems,
with new DNA?

667
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,857
>> Yes.

668
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,735
It's one of the reasons
why hybridization

669
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:33,284
is the better chosen
method than colonization.

670
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,077
>> I see.

671
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,205
>> Unless the circumstances
are such that where

672
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,957
you're colonizing
is very similar--

673
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,749
>> Right.

674
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,086
>> --hybridization is
much more appropriate,

675
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,507
which is why the original Lyrans
in the very ancient times began

676
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,511
the programs on Earth,
the genetic work on Earth,

677
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,472
because they needed to
create that hybridization

678
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,224
for their future incarnations.

679
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,977
Colonization was not
a comfortable option.

680
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,061
>> I see.

681
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,521
So when we even--

682
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,606
what if it was within
our solar system,

683
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,193
like Mars, if we were to
go to Mars or go to Venus?

684
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,277
Is that a--

685
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,655
>> It would be easier.

686
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,701
However-- and again, we're
speaking metaphorically.

687
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,578
This is basically-- we're going
to make this simple so you

688
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,872
understand, but let's say that--

689
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,126
let's say each of the
planets represents

690
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,170
an energy of a chakra, OK?

691
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,464
Earth being solar plexus chakra.

692
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:33,928
Let's say, then, that you
moved to another planet that

693
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,722
represents another chakra.

694
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,890
Basically, what you're
going to experience

695
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,520
is a similar structure, but
the aspects of that chakra

696
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,105
will need to come into play--

697
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:44,939
>> I see.

698
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,941
>> --more or be activated more.

699
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,776
And that's the kind
of the system--

700
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,071
the macrocosmic system
in a given solar system.

701
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,322
>> I see.

702
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,241
And if we were to do
that, we would need,

703
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,912
probably, technology
to aid in that life

704
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,665
force sustaining, you know, not
just air and everything else,

705
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,584
but, energetically, we would--

706
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,376
>> Yes.

707
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,962
>> --either have to do it--
do the work ourselves or have

708
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,921
an external technology.

709
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:13,050
>> Yes, but, actually, we see
that the most important thing

710
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,097
you would need to colonize a
moon of Jupiter or whatever is

711
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,142
actually mentors,
extraterrestrial mentors.

712
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:21,934
>> I see.

713
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,685
To help--

714
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,311
>> To help.

715
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:23,728
>> --with--

716
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,854
>> Yep.

717
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,899
>> --explain more than what
we physically know right now.

718
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,691
>> Exactly.

719
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:34,155
>> Because we only see such
as a small sliver of what is.

720
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:34,947
>> Exactly.

721
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,281
>> I See.

722
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:35,615
>> Exactly.

723
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,074
>> And that can
help out with that.

724
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:37,867
>> Yes.

725
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,120
>> Now, you know, I've heard
stories that humanity has

726
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,793
a breakaway civilization of a
secret space program, per se,

727
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,754
that we've been--

728
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,548
individuals from humanity
in the '50s and '60s

729
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,761
worked together to sort of start
colonizing our solar system.

730
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,553
>> Yes.

731
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,389
>> And started
doing this already.

732
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,768
And a lot of this whistleblower
stuff is coming out now.

733
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,899
And we're sort of
being made aware.

734
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,528
And then, hopefully, we can join
our own family back with us.

735
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,071
But they had--

736
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:21,327
I guess, they did have Draconian
assistance in their evolution

737
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,829
to colonize.

738
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,455
Is that-- am I
correct in saying that?

739
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,208
>> Well, we're going to say
there's truth and distortion.

740
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,042
>> OK.

741
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,460
>> OK.

742
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,506
Now, when truth
starts coming out,

743
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,716
there is a whole
faction on your world

744
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,053
that works very hard
to distort the truth

745
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:43,599
through sensationalistic things,
or red herrings, as you say.

746
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,352
So there is also a lot of that.

747
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:50,481
The researchers, themselves,
having good intentions

748
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,360
are given very, what seems to be
for them, credible information,

749
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,695
that isn't really credible.

750
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,655
So the truth gets
buried at another layer.

751
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,447
>> Sure.

752
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,783
>> So there is a lot
of different things.

753
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,244
This is why we don't talk
so much about this stuff.

754
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,872
It's also not our
mission, so to speak.

755
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,664
>> Sure, sure.

756
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,084
>> However, we can say,
just very basically, yes,

757
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,377
secret space programs.

758
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,880
Yes, the powers that
be, if you will,

759
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,257
are quite aware
that Mars was once

760
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,092
a thriving
civilization, that there

761
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,970
are things happening on the
moon, et cetera, et cetera.

762
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,846
>> OK.

763
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,722
Very good.

764
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,640
We don't need to go
into any more details.

765
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,433
>> Yes.

766
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,309
Not our forte.

767
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,810
>> Not yet.

768
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,355
Not until-- it'll all
develop in the way

769
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,398
it's supposed to develop.

770
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,816
>> Yes.

771
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,027
The Japanese energy
healing Reiki.

772
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,199
Lyssa told me the mountain
to go to where I can

773
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
find where it was developed.

774
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,079
But was that--

775
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,457
I think the founder even
said it came from the cosmos.

776
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,249
>> Yes.

777
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,461
>> It was downloaded to him
through this sort of cosmic

778
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,629
energy.

779
00:36:54,629 --> 00:37:00,051
Did that come from a specific
star system or some beings?

780
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,427
>> Yes.

781
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:06,224
Again, we very often use some
of the star names as archetypes.

782
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,268
But we see that the--

783
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,853
well, the legends
of Mount Kurama--

784
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,646
>> Yes.

785
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:16,359
>> --which is the mountain
we're talking about in Kyoto,

786
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,693
are that.

787
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,362
Beings from Venus--

788
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,154
>> OK.

789
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,114
>> --originally, two
million years ago,

790
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,991
came to that mountain.

791
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,119
Now, the question then is,
did the founder of Reiki

792
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,080
tap into Venus energy?

793
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,292
We would say that Venus, itself,
is a portal through which

794
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,544
other cosmic energy can come.

795
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:40,007
We see the Reiki energy as
being much more connected

796
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,425
to Arcturist energy.

797
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,218
>> Oh, OK.

798
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,764
>> It's very, very balanced
and very powerful in its

799
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,723
simplicity.

800
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,517
>> Mm-hmm.

801
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,645
And is that a representation,
then, of Arcturus, is

802
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,938
balance and simple?

803
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,898
>> Balance, simple.

804
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,734
You have also termed
it the angelic realm.

805
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,527
>> Mm-hmm.

806
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,820
>> It's a realm of--

807
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,612
>> OK, I see.

808
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,615
>> --integration where mental,
emotional, male, female,

809
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,950
et cetera, is all balanced.

810
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,788
It is also an energy that
is very easy for humans

811
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,333
to tap into when they
allow themselves to do so.

812
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,793
>> I've heard analogies.

813
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,754
They're like the
Jedis in Star Wars.

814
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,841
You know, the Arcturians,
they're sort of always

815
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,384
wearing robes and
sort of in that--

816
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,344
>> While, that's
how they're seen.

817
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:25,594
Yes.
>> How they're perceived.

818
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,304
How we perceive them
as, sort of masters.

819
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,431
>> Because mostly they
are sixth density,

820
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,891
so they're not physical
in that way any longer.

821
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,726
>> Very masterful.

822
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:36,272
And even, I've heard throughout
our galaxy and universe,

823
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,566
many other beings
sort of go there to do

824
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,026
pilgrimages and homework and--

825
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,818
>> Yes.

826
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,612
>> You know, and go to--

827
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,990
Sasha, have you been
to Arcturian system

828
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,074
to do some study and work?

829
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:47,867
Or--

830
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:52,538
>> Well, in my time
frame, the, you might say,

831
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,707
high Arcturian
civilization is long gone.

832
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,499
>> Oh.

833
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:55,708
OK.

834
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,169
>> Because they have gone into
they're ascension process.

835
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:58,961
>> Oh, I see.

836
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,795
OK.

837
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,173
>> So when people are
talking about that,

838
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,924
they are talking about--

839
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,509
again, we're going
off the timelines--

840
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,510
>> Sure.

841
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,803
>> --a past era--

842
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,596
>> Right.

843
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,430
>> --of the civilization.

844
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,515
>> When there was a
physical version to visit.

845
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,308
>> Yes.

846
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,351
>> I see.

847
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,688
I'm not sure if it was
you who mentioned this, but--

848
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,360
the Sirius energy, the way
they-- sort of their evolution

849
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,905
is they tapped into
their emotional body

850
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:31,535
through their mental
pineal gland direction.

851
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,328
>> Yes.

852
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,497
>> You know, and that was sort
of their evolutionary state.

853
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,122
Took them a while.

854
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,540
But through the
mental body, they

855
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,753
were actually able to access
their emotional bodies.

856
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,338
>> Yes.

857
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,339
They took the back door.

858
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,548
>> They took the back door.

859
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,175
Which is fascinating.

860
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,429
And you know, I see so many
similarities in humanity

861
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,556
where we get very mental.

862
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,891
>> Yes.

863
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,184
>> And I was wondering--

864
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:02,691
I've been working a lot with the
Amazonian medicine, ayahuasca.

865
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:10,116
And the chemical compound, which
induces a psychedelic trance

866
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,743
state, is DMT,
dimethyltryptamine,

867
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,788
which is very--

868
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:21,794
I see it very third eye
going into that state.

869
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,505
And that's sort of resonated
when I heard that download

870
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,216
because it feels that's
a similar path using

871
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:33,806
this medicine in a mental way to
connect to the emotional body.

872
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,598
>> Yes.

873
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,352
It's similar to the work the
Sirians did, but with a booster

874
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,228
rocket.

875
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:39,895
>> With a booster--

876
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,564
so they-- the ayahuasca
is the booster rocket?

877
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
>> The ayahuasca is
the booster rocket.

878
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,983
>> OK.

879
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,777
>> The Sirians, being that
their lineage is Vegan,

880
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,404
are very hard core.

881
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,615
And they didn't--
for most of the time,

882
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,534
didn't like to use help--

883
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,326
>> Sure.

884
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,828
>> --so to speak.

885
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,497
But humans like
shortcuts sometimes.

886
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,499
And we don't mean that
in any way disrespectful.

887
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,209
>> Right.

888
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,920
>> But it's like a booster
rocket for the same idea.

889
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,713
>> I see.

890
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,590
>> If it's used
properly, of course.

891
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,382
>> Right.

892
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,343
And the energy of
the ayahuasca spirit

893
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:15,097
that the shamans speak of,
this Grandmother Earth energy,

894
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,808
that's the way I've
always seen her,

895
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:24,857
is this almost a collective
unconditional love,

896
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,358
Mother Earth energy.

897
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,902
>> Yes.

898
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:33,991
>> That being, I was wondering
on a galactic scale--

899
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:40,372
how do the other ET races
interact with that energy?

900
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,874
Do they interact?

901
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,001
And is that part of--

902
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,212
is that part of the Earth's
collective consciousness?

903
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,464
>> It is part of the Earth's
collective consciousness.

904
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,425
And it goes back to some of what
we were talking about in terms

905
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,304
of how every planet, every
sun has its own consciousness.

906
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,096
>> OK.

907
00:41:56,096 --> 00:42:00,142
>> And so from the point of
view of an ET, such as myself,

908
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:04,480
whenever we come to a planet
to do any type of work

909
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,110
as an offering or as a service,
we have to get permission from

910
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,528
that collective consciousness.

911
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:12,321
>> I see.

912
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,740
>> First and foremost.

913
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,953
So you, as humans, are
moving toward this as well,

914
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,706
in terms of recognizing
your own planet as a living

915
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,791
consciousness.

916
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,461
And of course, once you
do, everything changes.

917
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,921
>> Oh, I already have.

918
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:33,342
And tapping into that energy
is-- it's so beautiful.

919
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,760
And I'm working
with the medicine

920
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,722
and working with the shamans
and our indigenous cultures who

921
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,350
have been working with this
energy for thousands of years.

922
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,559
>> Thousands of years.

923
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,894
>> With or without the medicine.

924
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,938
You know, the medicine is
just a permission slip--

925
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,730
>> Exactly.

926
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,274
>> --to talk to this energy.

927
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,694
But it's so beautiful.

928
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,780
And I'm just assuming that
that collective energy

929
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,952
is interacting with the
Pleiadian collective energies

930
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,744
on--

931
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,579
and other Sirian collectives--

932
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,372
>> Yes.

933
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,000
>> --on a greater
galactic scale of--

934
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,293
>> Yes.

935
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,210
We have to.

936
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,879
We have to do it that way.

937
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,381
>> So with that--

938
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,675
would she be part of the
Association of Worlds?

939
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,719
>> Yes.

940
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,511
Yes.

941
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,887
>> I see.

942
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,347
Interesting.

943
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,933
OK, well, thank you so much.

944
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,060
>> Now that we hear the
wheels going with that one.

945
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,020
>> Oh, there's so more.

946
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,479
I know I could go on forever.

947
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,606
But I want to honor
everybody's time.

948
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:33,193
And we've got lots of
great stuff to share here.

949
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:37,323
So thank you so
much for everything.

950
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,825
I'll leave it open just for
one last thing, if Sasha

951
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,578
wants to share anything for me.

952
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,621
I've heard that maybe--

953
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,538
>> My brother.

954
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,372
Yes.

955
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,916
>> I heard that--

956
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,792
I heard that earlier.

957
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,585
So--

958
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,797
>> There is another you in
my time stream, my dear.

959
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,425
And he is much more
flamboyant than you.

960
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,426
It's a he.

961
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,218
>> Flamboyant?

962
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,137
>> Flamboyant, actually.

963
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,641
In a-- we don't--

964
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,559
maybe not what you're imagining.

965
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,894
>> OK.

966
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,396
>> He doesn't wear rainbow
streamers or anything.

967
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,189
>> OK.

968
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:17,071
>> But he's very
excited and gregarious,

969
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,406
even more than you
are as a human.

970
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:25,120
And whenever he-- he's involved
a lot in some of the contact

971
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,376
work, in general,
introducing planets--

972
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,878
new planets to the
galactic community.

973
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:37,591
And whenever he is present, he,
let's say, lightens the mood.

974
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,093
Not that it's ever
a somber mood.

975
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:39,885
>> Sure.

976
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:45,140
>> But it's always he's always
a welcome invite to a party,

977
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,141
let's say.

978
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,142
>> Excellent, excellent.

979
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,479
>> So just tap into that
and see what you can get.

980
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,271
>> I would--

981
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,440
I always love parties.

982
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,858
>> Excellent.

983
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,151
>> And lightening the mood.

984
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,320
So that's very much so.

985
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
I resonate with that.

986
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,615
Does he have a name?

987
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,575
>> Let's see.

988
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,577

have to be translated

989
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,578

00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,513

1004
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:42,656
OK.

00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,615

1006
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,241
