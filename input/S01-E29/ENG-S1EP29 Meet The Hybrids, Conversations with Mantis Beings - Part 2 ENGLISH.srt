1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,820
Animals are and have always been
offering their love and vibrational

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,310
support to assist humankind.

3
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,710
They can show us how to love
and how to live in harmony,

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,160
and balance with Mother Earth.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,720
The whales and the dolphins have
been singing their songs to help to

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,390
awaken humanity, and they've been
doing this for a very long time.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,500
Also, our dogs, our cat friends,
horse friends and all other beings,

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,745
are offering us unconditional love.

9
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:03,165
They teach us about unconditional love.

10
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:10,995
Now, light language can uplift
us during these challenging days.

11
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:15,285
It bypasses the mind and the ego.

12
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:21,405
It nourishes our mind, our body,
our emotions, and our soul.

13
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:29,055
It brings us back to our hearts, our body,
our soul and light language can actually

14
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:37,005
shift us into feeling calmer and bring
us back into alignment with ourselves.

15
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:42,075
We need to remember that we're
all beautiful, amazing souls,

16
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,805
and we need to remember to be

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,869
in our power and to listen to our hearts.

18
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,950
And this is a profound period
of awakening for humankind.

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,850
Ever wonder if there's intelligent
life elsewhere in the universe?

20
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,920
Well, I have.

21
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,630
I've been wondering since I was a kid.

22
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,020
My name is Ruben Langdon. And on March
29th 2007, in the middle of the day.

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,280
I saw a number of strange objects

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,910
in the sky.

25
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,830
Coincidentally, I was working on the
film Avatar at the time, playing an

26
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,110
alien. And ever since then I've been on
a quest.  A quest to find out if aliens really do

27
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:14,410
exist, and if so, are they here with us?

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,370
If beings of higher

29
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,660
intelligence are here,

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,100
what is their purpose?

31
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,500
Why don't they make themselves more known?

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,030
Why the secrecy?

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,830
I've asked these questions to
many experts, yet each seems

34
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,820
to have a different theory.

35
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,140
So I thought to myself, why
not ask the aliens directly?

36
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,210
So that's what I set out to do.  

37
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,925
Well sort of...

38
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:37,912
Yeah, when I

39
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,370
was one of the experiences I had
one of the first one where, I.

40
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,465
When I was waking up in before I
was waking up at 14 or it was 15.

41
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:47,965
Really?

42
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,155
And at that point it was crazy
cuz I was in the UFO club.

43
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:56,794
I'm going like, way back then
there was like a UFO club and I

44
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:59,715
was like in it not knowing why.

45
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,645
And that was when Project
Blue Book and... >>Yeah.

46
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:13,265
>>And when my childhood was not, we'll
say idyllic and and I just remember

47
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,955
being very upset and angry about my
parents and that's teenage stuff anyway.

48
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:32,885
But I was sitting on my bed
just yelling and saying, get

49
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:35,164
me the hell out here you guys.

50
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,674
I said, I wish you UFO
would come and take me away.

51
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,734
Not knowing at that time..  >>The connection.

52
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:53,354
>>Within a week I went in my backyard and
above the woods in our backyard, midday

53
00:05:53,715 --> 00:06:02,085
blue sky, a silver disc came, sh, came
shot down, was just above the trees.

54
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,215
That's how close it was.

55
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:03,995
>>Wow.

56
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,594
>>And it stayed there.

57
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,625
And I'm go like, oh my God.

58
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,655
I'm like, and it did all these
angles, which has a meaning for me.

59
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:19,395
It did all these crosses and not
crosses in the Christian sense.

60
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:27,585
But, and and then they had actually I
didn't recall this till later, but they

61
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:32,594
took me on ship starting to prepare
me to have hybrid children, but,

62
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:36,614
but when I watched the ship
leave, I've never seen anything

63
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,905
spin away so fast in my life.

64
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:44,025
I could see it, it was clear
blue sky, and I went, oh my God.

65
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:49,844
I called them in and what the heck
did I really wanna go and leave?

66
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:54,585
And then I, maybe I need to change my mind
here right about this, and careful for it.

67
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,965
Rethink this, yeah.

68
00:06:57,155 --> 00:07:02,684
But that was an amazing experience for me.

69
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:03,815
>>Wow.

70
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,294
>>Just amazing

71
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,044
>>I'm sorry, how

72
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:06,825
old were you at that time?

73
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:07,439
>>Four, fifteen.

74
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:07,789
>>Fifteen?

75
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,474
Okay.

76
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:09,409
>>Yeah.

77
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:09,909
>>Amazing.

78
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:10,724
>>Yeah.

79
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,804
>>So that one really left its mark,
and since then you've just been...

80
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,354
>>Ever since then I've been 
on the UFO track.

81
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:17,895
Really,

82
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,515
yeah, definitely.

83
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:25,544
Every book, every... just it's
almost like an obsession, but...

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,480
it's because -  from the subconscious
that you're just trying to put, 

85
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,710
to put it together.

86
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:34,120
>>Yeah.
>>Understand that

87
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,260
that's where who we are.

88
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,570
>>That's where I think

89
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,890
where we come

90
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,130
in.

91
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:45,120
Because, when I first woke up
there was this, I was at work.

92
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,470
I was at work, and this
guy comes up to me, right?

93
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,450
And it's odd...

94
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,290
This guy comes up to me and he has two
pieces of paper in his handwriting.

95
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,880
They're like little, they're little
tiny flyers with just some conspiracy

96
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,740
theories written on him, like FEMA
camps and UFOs, and just think, I

97
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,300
wish I had signed that piece of paper.

98
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,750
>>Yeah.

99
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,940
>>But anyways this guy comes in,
he has two pieces of paper and

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,130
he says, Hey, I want some, I got
something for you to check out.

101
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,320
And he hands me this piece of paper
and I look at it and I'm like, oh,

102
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,230
I've heard of this stuff before.

103
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,750
And he just smirks at me like,
and then my coworker is oh, do you

104
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,850
have an extra one of those paper?

105
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,540
So he's yeah, I do.

106
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,090
Hands over the second paper,
which is the exact same thing.

107
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,169
It's almost like he knew already
that she was gonna ask for it.

108
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,760
So he was ready, walks off.

109
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,990
I never see or hear from him again.

110
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,789
He just dis, he just walks off.

111
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,210
And so I let it sit for a while and
I thought, okay, I'll, I got sick and

112
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,990
I was bored and I thought, okay, I'll
check this paper out, check it out,

113
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,760
and I was like, oh my goodness,
there's something to this ya know?

114
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,080
There's something going on here.

115
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,290
And I remember just getting scared cuz
when you start reading up on this, you

116
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,180
have the, it's the whole fear thing.

117
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:10,100
All the world's going, Nibiru's coming and
the world's gonna end and tie waves know?

118
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,360
Yes.

119
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,480
And earthquakes and volcanoes and
all hell's gonna break loose, right?

120
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,750
And I'm like, oh in 2012,
cause this happened in 2009,

121
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,030
2012's gonna be here.

122
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,890
And I'm just like, oh my God.

123
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:34,290
But then the first craft comes in Jan,
oh, was it let's see, 4th of July.

124
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,250
Yes, 4th of July.

125
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,000
And I remember, seeing this
little tiny satellite in this sky.

126
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:43,170
And I'm like going, okay, for
something, zigzag, zigzag and nothing.

127
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,410
Later that night, my wife
and I go outside, oh, I was

128
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,790
smoking cigarettes at the time.

129
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,510
Let's go out.

130
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,500
It was like one in the morning.

131
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,580
All the fireworks were done.

132
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,750
Let's go out and smoke cigarette.

133
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,220
And next thing we know
here's that satellite again.

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,860
And next thing I know it's.

135
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,089
50 yards away from us, and
it was this golden disc.

136
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,900
And it'd play with us because
when we wouldn't look at it, it'd

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,740
turn on and it would move and
then we'd look it, turn off, and

138
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,150
then we're like, did you see that?

139
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,829
What was that?

140
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,670
And then we'd look away.

141
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,839
It's like turns on goes and then
turns, look, turn off and all of a

142
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,240
sudden it just turns off and boom goes
to space, and I was like, oh shit.

143
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,780
I just saw, I was like, I just saw
something, finally I saw something.

144
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:28,285
>>Yeah.

145
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,349
>>And at that moment, your
life is completely changed.

146
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:32,250
>>It's, yeah...

147
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,150
>>And I remember I just got
obsessed at that moment.

148
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,650
I was obsessed like, okay, now
I need to find out what was

149
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,699
that, what on Earth was that?

150
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,300
And I just re, I'd done thousands
of hours of research to my wife.

151
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:49,620
It's you're just getting away too obsessed
with this, and I'm like look what we saw.

152
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,209
Yeah.

153
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,989
And that's when the experience started.

154
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,665
My memory of experiences
started happening.

155
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,495
So I started saying, I need to see a ship.

156
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,084
I need to see a ship.

157
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,074
I need to see something.

158
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,275
I need confirmation.

159
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,540
This is happening to me.

160
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,895
And then we have that 45 minute encounter.

161
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:09,405
It was I'll give you just a brief.

162
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:14,354
My, my wife and I were sitting in
the house her mom, we were living

163
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,614
at her mom's house at the time.

164
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:17,954
Her mom goes to the grocery store.

165
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:22,364
It was December 20th 2009.

166
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,125
And it was about seven
o'clock in the evening.

167
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,125
So it was just dark,
and her mom takes off.

168
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,345
I go to make a phone call, the
phones are dead and go out.

169
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:32,594
Yeah, let's go outside.

170
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:32,925
Smoke.

171
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,134
Here's this smoking again.

172
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,535
But I've quit since then.

173
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,805
But I look up and here
cuz this blue light just.

174
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,550
Pops up in the sky, it
looks like a bar of light.

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,100
And just neon blue, I can't even
really describe it because the color

176
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,040
doesn't exist in the, on this planet.

177
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,040
And then another light turns on, so it's
like this big bar and then a little bar.

178
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,990
And it was a 45 minute in interaction,
this thing just zipping around

179
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,220
doing the most crazy things.

180
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:02,610
>>Wow.

181
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,630
And your wife's saw it as well?

182
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,660
>>Yeah, exactly.

183
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,780
And like I was saying, I was freaked out.

184
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,700
You like, oh my God, what is this thing?

185
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,700
And it flies over us and this blue
plasma turns off and, you know

186
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,910
what a, like these canister lights,
the canister lights like these?

187
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,510
It had three, like a triangle.

188
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,990
Three.

189
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,470
>>Okay.

190
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,210
>>So 1, 2, 3 of them.

191
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,460
>>It was a black triangle?
>>Purple.

192
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,400
>>Purple, okay.

193
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,050
>>Purple.

194
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,350
A dark purple.

195
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,190
And then two two sets
of three in the front.

196
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,210
So two sets of three.

197
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,710
And

198
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,040
three sets of three in the back.

199
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,710
Inside the canister is a pyramid.

200
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:45,960
It's a black crystal pyramid with a,
the best I can describe it was a black

201
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,219
hole at the very tip of the pyramid.

202
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,460
And then when they turn it on, all
of a sudden this blue plasma starts

203
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:57,780
circling around the black hole
and then starts leaking out and

204
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,130
then circling around the others.

205
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,200
And it's like floating
on this blue plasma.

206
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,880
And when it flies over, it's like a,
it was like a amethyst crystal ship.

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,645
It's seamless and had these
just weird designs on it.

208
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:17,990
And the things that it
did was just mind numbing.

209
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,550
>>It's amazing.

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,340
>>It was an overcast sky.

211
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,085
At the end of the experience, it takes
off and blows a mile wide hole through the,

212
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:28,310
through the clouds.

213
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:31,709
>>So it was definitely of
this density in that case,

214
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,569
>>Yeah, 
>>because it had to have an effect

215
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:34,170
on the cloud.

216
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,829
It wasn't just...

217
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,129
>>I tried taking pictures of it.

218
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,430
But every time I go take a picture
the battery life went to dead.

219
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,229
Finally we got a shot and
the flash goes off.

220
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,729
I'll give you that picture.

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,079
The flash goes off and the ship's about
a couple, about a mile or so away.

222
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,250
So you can only see the line.

223
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,609
There were two beings across the street.

224
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,839
And when the flash went off, the
being turned into an orb and went

225
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,640
back to the ship, this being turned
into an orb, it went back to the ship.

226
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,930
>>Yeah.
>>And when

227
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,910
you say they were across the street
and doing this motion, what does

228
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,410
that mean there?

229
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,750
>>Okay so here's the being right,
like a humanoid standing there.

230
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,659
Here's those two humanoids standing there.

231
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,630
The flash goes off, this one
turned into an orb and this

232
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,130
one starts turning into an orb.

233
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,060
So I got the picture of the being
materialized, dematerializing

234
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,439
to go back to the ship.

235
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:19,829
>>Oh wow.

236
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:25,155
>>And then a being that is, dematerialized
on the process going back to the

237
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,814
craft, and then the craft turned
around and started flashing us.

238
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:29,564
>>When you say

239
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,845
humanoid, were they the
Mantis humanoid looking?

240
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:32,295
>>What were they?

241
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:33,805
>>No different being.

242
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:39,724
I think they were more like a
just a benevolent humanoid being.

243
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:42,975
>>There's so many.

244
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:48,065
>>There's so many cultures, so
many different races and cultures that...

245
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:48,565
>>I

246
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,845
got ahold of MUFON cuz I was,
damn who do you get ahold of?

247
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,655
So I went to MUFON, I was, Ahhh -
you won't believe what I saw!

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,205
And they sent their
star level investigator.

249
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:05,475
He was a nuclear physicist
from Livermore Labs.

250
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:05,965
>>Wow.

251
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:06,465
>>Yeah.

252
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,155
and,

253
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,845
>>That's some interesting people.

254
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:09,345
>>Yeah.

255
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,125
He went through, he said, oh we
had a class level four encounter

256
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,865
and it's been investigated.

257
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,510
Then Bigelow Aerospace started
calling and I'm like, who do I?

258
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,350
How do you help?

259
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,840
I need help.

260
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,660
>>So wait, Bigelow Aerospace called you?

261
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,330
>>Yeah, Bigelow Aerospace
called me and they were like,

262
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,990
>>And what?

263
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,600
And because they read your MUFON report?

264
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,192
>>Yeah, exactly.
Well MUFON, 

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,850
I guess the guy that I was with
transferred my information to Bigelow

266
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,620
Aerospace and did, so they called

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,380
me trying to get...

268
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,320
>>Why did he transfer,

269
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,010
Did he say?

270
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,910
>>I have no idea.

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,720
I have no idea.

272
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,560
But the Bigelow guy was real pushy, he
was like, I need, I want this information.

273
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,100
You know who I am.
Brrr, brrr, brr.

274
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,380
I was like, alright, I'm done.

275
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm done.

276
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,510
So I need to find help.

277
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,880
And that's when finally, after a couple
other experiences..

278
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,700
>>More pieces of the puzzle, 

279
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,550
sorry, I know a lot about Bigelow Aerospace and what's going on there, but..

280
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,120
>>Yeah.

281
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,780
Yeah, now I do.

282
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,680
>>It's really, yeah, it's
just really nice for...

283
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,840
>>Yeah, I got in touch with other
contactees and other hybrids and

284
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,240
we formed a real tight community.

285
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,970
So everyone that's in, yeah, most
people in Barbara's book, we've been..

286
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,420
>>We've really..
>>We just help each other.

287
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,780
And that's another point to this.

288
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,510
We're...
>>Right.

289
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,850
>>We wanna just help other people
that are experiencing to get over

290
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,560
their fear and just to connect.

291
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,260
And so that way we have someone to
talk to and to let you know - yeah,

292
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,319
you're not alone!

293
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,349
>>Our connections, we are family.

294
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:45,120
We are family and when, and
I wouldn't do very well if I

295
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,700
didn't have these connections.

296
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,470
>>Sure.

297
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,510
>>It's just different.

298
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,030
>>Yeah.

299
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,189
>>It's not trying to look
special or anything like that.

300
00:16:56,194 --> 00:17:01,589
It's not about any of that because
we're not, but it's just coming

301
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:07,480
from, I come from, I feel so ET
it's so hard to be here some days.

302
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,310
But we're here and it's really fun

303
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:18,515
to share what we've, it's what we're
here to do and and I love doing that,

304
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:28,005
but we, we're so blessed to have each
other and when Barbara and Miguel

305
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,075
asked us to come together to do
this, we've all gotten a lot closer.

306
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:38,445
And have come to meet these, some
other hybrids connected with the book.

307
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:45,405
And then Barbara and
Miguel have totally...

308
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:48,465
respected and honored us for who we are.

309
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,350
>>Yeah, great time.

310
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,315
>>And that has been a
huge gift for all of us.

311
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,035
>>Yeah.

312
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,025
>>They're amazing.

313
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:56,805
>>I'd love to

314
00:17:56,805 --> 00:18:02,295
know a little bit more on how the
idea for the book came together

315
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,605
and then the idea for the book.

316
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,775
Who contacted you and how

317
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,495
did that work?

318
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:09,975
>>Miguel Mendonca from England.

319
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,245
Had been contacting Barbara.

320
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:27,255
So Barbara invited a number of us to be
involved to be interviewed for the book.

321
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:36,255
We spent many, many, many hours together 
on Skype being interviewed and so all of....

322
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:40,695
>>How did you know, I guess
Barbara put you guys together.

323
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,785
How did you know about Barbara's work?

324
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,825
Or had you had done regression

325
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:46,635
sessions with her?

326
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:49,405
>>I had met Barbara, actually.

327
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,485
I had known Barbara off and on here, 
meeting her at the

328
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,495
conference, but we weren't close.

329
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:54,995
>>Okay.

330
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:59,345
>>And then she and I met at a separate
meeting where Rob and I met too

331
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:05,294
last April, and Barbara and I just
connected and went off and just had our

332
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,905
own little meeting for a little while.

333
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,845
And and then she invited me.

334
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,665
She said, Jacqueline I'd love
to have you to be a part of this.

335
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:22,365
And I said, oh, I would love, be so
honored to be so we were all

336
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:23,564
contacted.

337
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:24,485
>>Yeah.

338
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:30,855
>>And it's been an incredible journey
and we've all become very close.

339
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:31,695
>>Yeah.

340
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:32,895
>>Very close.

341
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:33,395
>>Yeah.

342
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:39,635
>>This is a door that's been
needed to be open for a while.

343
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:46,544
And the gift is that it's open
now, and that Barbara could be here,

344
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:52,000
and open that door and that we
could all be a part of it together.

345
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,055
It, it means more than I can even say.

346
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:56,615
>>Yeah.

347
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:57,105
>>Yeah.

348
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:57,540
>>Yeah.

349
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,050
>>Perfect.

350
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:05,340
Have you come across, a lot of times
in this world we see a lot of the

351
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,439
positive and we mentioned the shift
in the perspective and whatnot, but

352
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,750
is there a negative force or negative
entities out there that have, that

353
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,490
you've encountered and come in

354
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,240
contact with?

355
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,739
>>Yes.

356
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:21,125
There's the

357
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:28,439
full spectrum of beings of what
humans label positive and negative.

358
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,120
When I talk to the star beings,
they present it in this way.

359
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,250
They say this just is.

360
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,529
We do not have the perspective of negative
or positive, it's just the spectrum.

361
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:49,555
So, but for us here, in terms
of what we would label as, I

362
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,985
kind of prefer to use the 'darker energy'.

363
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,915
That's just a part of it.

364
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:55,205
Yes.

365
00:20:55,205 --> 00:21:00,915
I've had actually many encounters
with those kinds of energies.

366
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:01,845
Yes.

367
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:09,085
There are star beings or ETs
who have the darker energy.

368
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:14,740
And I have had some encounters with them
and it took me a while to understand

369
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,235
and to learn how to work with that.

370
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,925
And once I understood it,
it became easy.  For me

371
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:26,455
it's all about sending
them love and light.

372
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:32,475
And when I send them love and light
and I say to them, I choose to stand

373
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,435
in the light and serve divine love and
light, they're not interested in me

374
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,605
at that point.  I'll say, you
need to go find someone else.

375
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:50,020
If you need to do that, but I am not
going to choose to work with you.

376
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,820
I have worked with a number of people
where I will help clear them as a

377
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:05,460
certified hypnotherapist, and I do healing
work as well, to help the person come

378
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,370
to a place of coming out of the fear.
To help the person become empowered

379
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,890
within themselves so that they can
learn how to send the love and the

380
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,300
light and stand in their power,

381
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,960
and not be afraid because it's
the fear that attracts them.

382
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,580
So there...

383
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:36,100
so there are those beings, ET
beings who are of that nature and

384
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,210
many other darker energies as well

385
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,290
that we would not label ET,
who are just of the darker

386
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,129
forces doing what they're to do.

387
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:55,560
If we shine the love and light,
they're not interested in that.

388
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,520
They're not resonating with that.

389
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,879
So they will go elsewhere.

390
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:06,840
And I do like to, when I'm working
with other people or I see them in

391
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,129
the area or trying to intrude upon my
space, I do call in Archangel Michael.

392
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:22,530
And my other star families who are very
high love and light to escort them into,

393
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,510
to connect with the original light.

394
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,935
If that's appropriate, to take
them where they need to go.

395
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:34,740
And I always say I release all
of you with love and light.

396
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,590
I honor respect,
honor respect your role.

397
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,080
And I release you with love and light.

398
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,135
I don't go in...
>>And you say

399
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:46,125
if that's appropriate, meaning maybe
in some cases it is, that's the

400
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,625
experience that they need to experience.

401
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,335
Is that..
>>Correct

402
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:52,365
>>Is that fear and.. 
>>I leave that up to Archangel Michael.

403
00:23:53,285 --> 00:24:01,435
And the other angels who are working
with escorting them into another space

404
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:07,485
or dimension, that's not up to me to
decide that's about their soul.

405
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:13,035
And those angels, but, and once
you learn that it's really pretty

406
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:18,450
easy then to shield, I call it
shielding yourself with love.

407
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,435
And my Qua Bar, my star being
family, that's what he always says,

408
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:29,485
they always say, cuz it's a group
consciousness, they always say

409
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,695
to all the star seeds,

410
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,775
your shield is love and light and...

411
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:38,190
>>So you're not necessarily putting
up a wall or a shield per se,

412
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,639
you're just vibrating at this
love frequency, which creates an

413
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:44,810
automatic sort of cloaking device.

414
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,470
>>It does put out love and light, and
for me it does create a kind of shield.

415
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,760
And I do put love and light around
me as a shield, if you.. 

416
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,909
I mean everything.

417
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:58,409
Yeah.

418
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:07,560
That's just for me that I like
to love is, love and light is

419
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,030
allowed to come in and out.

420
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:16,320
But anything else is filtered 
because of I'm doing this work every day

421
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:19,290
of my life, pretty much with people and I,

422
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,925
it just gets filtered out.

423
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:25,965
>>I guess when you say love and light
shield, I guess the idea of putting

424
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,345
up a wall or a barrier..
>>Right.

425
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:32,570
>>actually attracts, but then if you're
putting up a wall of love and light

426
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,320
then it's not, the frequency....

427
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:42,795
Usually when we put up the walls,
it's a hate or a distaste, a

428
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:44,615
not liking of...
>>It's out of fear.

429
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,745
>>It's out of fear.

430
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:49,995
And then that wall is created of
fear and then it attracts more fear.

431
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:50,660
>>Correct.

432
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,445
And I don't create, it's not a wall.

433
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:54,615
Maybe I shouldn't even call it a shield.

434
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,635
I perceive it in that way.

435
00:25:57,065 --> 00:25:59,715
But it's just, I have certain boundaries.

436
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:04,335
I keep my psychic, I wanna keep
my psychic boundaries,

437
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:08,215
because of the work I'm doing.
>> I learnt my lessons the hard way with that.

438
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:10,905
>>And that's how I learned too,
cuz I didn't have anybody

439
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,345
to teach me.

440
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,370
And I learned some of it the hard way.

441
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,240
Definitely hard.

442
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,860
>>Yeah.
>>Yeah, I did too.

443
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah.

444
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,020
I feel like, enough of this!

445
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:27,450
>>For me, on the negative spectrum of
things, I went to, when I first started

446
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,860
waking up, I went full, I, what I like
to call full blown light warrior mode.

447
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,150
I felt like I had to physically
combat these negative entities.

448
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,160
And I'll tell you in these physical
forms, having a fist fight with

449
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,750
a interdimensional being..
>>Wow.

450
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,290
>>It doesn't turn out good.

451
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:52,970
>>Yeah.  I can imagine.

452
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,230
>>Ever.

453
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,100
You know and I just I was just always
just, oh, I need to just fight.

454
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,700
I need to fight.

455
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,250
I need to fight because these things are... and I 
noticed that the more and more and more

456
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,910
I fought the more and more 
and more I had to fight.

457
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,750
And the more and more I just kept
getting beat and kept getting beat.

458
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,750
And I think that's the part where
the sickness came in too.

459
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,010
>>OK, the physical sickness?

460
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,850
>>Yeah, the physical sickness.

461
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,155
Cuz I was just Warrior Mode.

462
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,830
I gotta be the most powerful
light warrior I can.

463
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,530
I need to save the world.

464
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,990
>>Which is... the contradiction in that title.

465
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,730
>>Yeah. It's great.

466
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,920
>>I'm The Light Warrior!

467
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,470
>>Yeah.

468
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,590
>>I love that.

469
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,180
>>Yeah.

470
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,120
And then when I finally discovered that,
when I finally said, you know what?

471
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.

472
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,420
I don't want to fight anymore.

473
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,629
I'm tired of fighting.

474
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,045
You know, I gotta.

475
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,010
I gotta leave what's back there in
the past, it's just the past, it's

476
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,720
just, I had learn to let go.

477
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,100
I had to learn to forgive myself and I noticed
and just when I stopped fighting and

478
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,110
I went more into here, into my heart
and I became more accepting of every,

479
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,479
of everything and the negative entities
that came around, I'm just like I

480
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,669
don't even want to deal with you.

481
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:11,189
They stopped coming around cause I
stopped giving 'em what they wanted.

482
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,850
I stopped feeding into them.

483
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:19,919
Cause that's what really what it is
we, they we feed into them and in a way

484
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,960
it becomes a symbiotic relationship.

485
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,150
>>Right.
>>Too, where,

486
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,150
they're giving me what I want.

487
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,215
Because I'm, I want to fight
them so they'll be more than

488
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:29,264
happy to come and fight me.

489
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:29,750
>>Come and fight.

490
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,074
>>Yeah.

491
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,635
>>So I'm giving them what they want.

492
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:32,895
They're giving me what I want.

493
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:33,395
>>Right.

494
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:38,564
>>And I see that that's in a way, what, how the
negativity on this planet works.  >> Yeah.

495
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:44,024
>>Is we ended up as a human species,
we developed this symbiotic

496
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,635
relationship with these negative beings.

497
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:51,855
And in all reality I feel
that we, we brought 'em here

498
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:54,225
by warring with each other,

499
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,945
>>Yeah.
>>over countless of eons.

500
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:59,985
And so they're gladly come in
and say, okay, you guys like war.

501
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:01,335
We'll give you war.

502
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:04,455
You guys like, torturing each other.

503
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:05,985
We will come and we'll give you that.

504
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,465
We'll give you what you want.

505
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:12,615
>>Well this is, I guess, these higher
beings understand this as well.

506
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,105
So that's, they're this higher vibration.

507
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:22,784
But let's go to, I guess in your
cases with the mantis, but also

508
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:24,345
with the Zeta reticuli beings.

509
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,705
Cuz this is - more people have
had experience in this realm.

510
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:34,764
They, even though they may be benevolent
in their intentions across the large

511
00:29:34,784 --> 00:29:41,385
scale spectrum of things, these, the
fear that's created from the abduction

512
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:49,665
scenarios or temporary detainment scenarios,
doesn't that draw in negative entities?

513
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:53,614
Because the people who have these
experiences and then they're like you said

514
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:55,064
in the beginning, I'm a light warrior.

515
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:58,425
I'm, you've had these experiences and
now you're gonna go and fight them.

516
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:03,915
And is that creating a negative...
>>Sure.

517
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:06,445
>>reality here on Earth and aren't they

518
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:07,245
aware of that?

519
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:13,255
>>And then it, all of that energy is in
the collective human consciousness.

520
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:18,225
So that's what we're trying to help
shift now, is to shift that energy in the

521
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:21,895
collective, that, that it can be different.

522
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:29,925
And fear, again, wherever there is
fear, it opens one to attracting

523
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,344
>>Right
>>the, these other energies.

524
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:40,695
>>Yeah.
>>That and so it's, it is unfortunate.

525
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:48,855
And then and people do often see that
the grays and all ETs are demons and

526
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:55,784
and I talked to a gentleman yesterday
here, for a while back that he was so

527
00:30:55,784 --> 00:31:00,375
scared and I said, nooo, you know, it's, yeah...

528
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,700
>>It's about the perspective.

529
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,930
>>It really is.

530
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:11,970
>>So what do these ETs, these higher
ETs that are doing the temporary

531
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,190
detainments, to upgrade our DNA, to
move us into these higher realms?

532
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,780
How do they, I don't wanna use the word
combat, or how do they deal with the,

533
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:31,860
the scenarios when certain individuals do go
into these states of fear and demonizing

534
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,360
them and all these other things?

535
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,080
Is there, do they just okay,
that's that person's soul contract,

536
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,120
that's what they need to deal with.

537
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,710
Or, but because that's very
contradictory to what their mission is.

538
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,310
>>Yeah.

539
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,510
>>Or is it?

540
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,390
>>It's a whole soul thing.

541
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,580
We're living many lives at once.

542
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,690
>>Right
>>Simultaneously.

543
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,880
So what might be going on in another
aspect of the soul might be affecting...

544
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,740
>>Yeah.

545
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:06,000
>>the human part that's here on Earth in
the moment. Maybe they're wanting to

546
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,200
learn something that's crossing over..

547
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,290
>>Yeah.

548
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,850
>>from another aspect from
the soul, it's so... >>Yeah.

549
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,670
>>Complex, but...
>>Yeah.

550
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,940
>>It's, but I hear what you're asking.

551
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:31,650
And the higher we call them, the
higher beings of light in that because

552
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,580
they come from a place of love,
divine love, unconditional love.

553
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:46,020
They're they just allow the scenario
to play out in whatever way.

554
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:52,380
Now if someone calls on the higher beings
to come in and help, then they can come in.

555
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:52,950
>>Yeah.

556
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,510
>>And..
>>Yeah.

557
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,890
>>and help but it's...

558
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,620
>>Yeah.

559
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,400
The interferencing is, ya know...

560
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,820
>>Yeah, well like in in my case, in my
experience, when I, had this entity,

561
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:16,905
just grabbed me by my throat, it's
like they, they have the ability,

562
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:18,629
the mantis beings have the ability to..

563
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:23,820
>>Sorry, this is not the getting
the toothpick out of you, it's a different,

564
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,449
that's when you grabbed that being?

565
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,790
>>Yeah, that's when I grabbed that being.

566
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:34,980
But this is the whole, when I, my warrior
time, I got into a, like a skirmish

567
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:43,320
with an entity and it picked me up and
slammed me down, and you hear this, wow.

568
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,670
It's scary as shit, but, oh, yeah.

569
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,360
>>Yeah.

570
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,100
>>Looking back, the Mantis being
has the ability to go leave 'em alone.

571
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,049
>>Yeah. Like the Jedi, just..

572
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:52,969
>>Yeah, exactly.

573
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:56,639
But they're, it's more for
them, they're like you

574
00:33:57,074 --> 00:34:02,014
brought that entity to you so you know
now how are you going to deal with it?

575
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,854
And it's not until you,
you say, okay, please help.

576
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:08,654
>>Then they come in and
they do their Jedi stuff.

577
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:09,554
>>Yeah. Then they go, okay.

578
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:10,295
Yeah.
>>Alright.

579
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:13,935
>>And it's about us learning
to be in our power here.

580
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:17,415
So how do we learn, ya know.

581
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:19,995
>>Yeah.
>>We have different experiences.

582
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:20,545
>>Yeah.

583
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,745
>>And I, yeah,

584
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:29,235
because that's how I learned really
stand up and be in my power was, and I

585
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:33,674
thank them for those experiences and

586
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:34,824
sure.

587
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:35,540
But...

588
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,415
>>Opportunities to learn. 
>>Opportunities.

589
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,174
>>Opportunities to learn.

590
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,815
If we all can take that
perspective in the moment.

591
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,304
That would...

592
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:45,614
>>In the moment.. 
>>It's near impossible.

593
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:46,125
>>Yeah.

594
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,355
Because it can be very very scary and
that's what they love to do is

595
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,655
scare you as much as possible.

596
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:56,384
I've seen objects float across rooms.

597
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:57,145
>>Yeah.

598
00:34:57,145 --> 00:35:02,805
>>I've seen all kinds of things from...,
and then I was working with people

599
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:05,475
with that, and then I actually
gave that up at some point.

600
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:10,184
Cause I thought, I don't
wanna be doing this any more.

601
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:10,964
>>Yeah.

602
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:16,515
>>Well speaking of fear and the mantis being,
so my first encounter actually wasn't

603
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,235
the encounter on the lunar eclipse.

604
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:27,176
I had a meditation on a mountain and I was
given this vision of the back of a Mantis

605
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:29,625
Being, and he turned and looked at me.

606
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:31,964
Oh, and then I said, hello.

607
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,575
And there wasn't, I didn't have any fear.

608
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:35,565
I was like, oh, interesting.

609
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,265
This is..
>>That's great.

610
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:37,285
>>What is this here?

611
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:43,845
And then I'm connecting the
dots and thinking that maybe because

612
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:51,150
of my non-fear in that vision, in
that meditation I didn't get startled

613
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,800
and get knocked outta my meditation.

614
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,300
I was like, oh that - this is interesting,

615
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,600
who are you? Just a
look, stared into the eyes,

616
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:03,940
and then and then I started meditating
on other stuff, kinda went away.

617
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,540
So I just acknowledged that.

618
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,105
And then, a couple months later on the
eclipse, I got this, the massive download.

619
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:17,700
And then part of what I've been doing,
my invest, trying to find out more about

620
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:21,900
Mantis beings, I heard that they're keeping
in the back because of their looks,

621
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,490
because they're so 
different looking, and...

622
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,910
>>If someone's fearful of them,
they'll all step back, 

623
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,100
but boy, they're in my face all the time.

624
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,430
Yeah.

625
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,810
But they know that I love them and
I love seeing them as they are.

626
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,220
But yes, they'll, they're very respectful.

627
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,820
They know how each person will
handle it and what they can handle.

628
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,400
>>So they already kind of,  they don't want, if 

629
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,710
people are gonna have that fear.

630
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,701
They don't, so then they...

631
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,490
>>No, they're gone.

632
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:53,160
>>And then, but they also know, maybe they
know that because of their looks and they

633
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,100
are quite different than than what we have
in our conscience with the grays or with,

634
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,089
the Palladian blonde blue-eyed type beings.

635
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,230
So they keep in the back a little bit?

636
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,560
>>Yeah.

637
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,350
>>Yes, definitely.

638
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,710
>>Oh yeah,

639
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,410
I've had, if you imagine, where
a seven foot tall Mantis being

640
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:14,879
was at the foot of my bed.

641
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:14,970
>>Yeah.

642
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,695
>>If you can imagine a normal
person that you know...

643
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,570
normal if you will?

644
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,585
>>Someone who's not exposed to this..

645
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:23,905
>>Someone who's not exposed.

646
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:29,424
>>And next thing you know, you got an eight
foot tall praying mantis in your room.

647
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,005
It's horrifying.

648
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:35,944
It's the same thing as imagine if you're
scared of spiders and now there's a ten

649
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:42,645
foot spider in your house, and it's
like dripping venom and like going raaar, but

650
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,235
it's like really telling you, I love you.

651
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,205
>>Yeah, exactly.

652
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:48,924
>>Yeah.

653
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:50,625
>>You're gonna freak out.

654
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:51,615
>>Yeah.

655
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:55,155
And they, I was so happy when
they, and they initially showed up

656
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,110
because they came as themselves.

657
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,195
And they always come in my
bedroom, I'm always, when I'm

658
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,415
in bed, they always show up.

659
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:07,065
And there were eight of them
around my bed with my first actual

660
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,135
encounter in that way with them.

661
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,640
And I went.

662
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,160
>>Yeah.

663
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:10,799
>>Wow.

664
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,380
You guys are the mantis.

665
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,390
And I was like, so excited.

666
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:15,980
>>Yeah.

667
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,160
>>And I said, welcome! Ya know it didn't, 
I was just like, and they come all

668
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,680
the time because me, I just love it.

669
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,670
>>You just reminded me of something.

670
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,250
You know an important thing to know
for everyone this would be for

671
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,899
everyone, to tell the difference.

672
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:34,290
>>Okay.

673
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,350
>>Cause I, I come across this a lot,
how to tell the difference between

674
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,940
a negative and a positive entity.

675
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,490
My, cuz I've had encounters
with both, physical 3D manifestations.

676
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,549
I don't have, I don't have
the ability, like some people

677
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:51,910
to see, I don't see auras.

678
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:54,750
I don't see the ghost.

679
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,649
I see full.

680
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,870
It has to be a full 3D manifestation
in order for me to see it.

681
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,555
I'm just like a everybody else.

682
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:07,875
I've had now the mantis beings, I've had
them physically appear before me, and

683
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:16,245
the feeling that I get from them... imagine
you have a childhood friend, right?

684
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:20,115
And that childhood friend, you grew
up with that friend, and you

685
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:21,915
guys did everything together, right?

686
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,225
It's gonna be here in your heart.

687
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:24,645
>>Yeah.

688
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:25,395
>>You'll feel it right here.

689
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,234
I know you.

690
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,975
>>Yeah.
>>You're so familiar to me.

691
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:30,225
Why are you so familiar to me?

692
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,445
My first encounter with a mantis
being with just like that. I'm

693
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:37,545
staring at it's face and it's
like, why are you so familiar?

694
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:38,815
How do I know you?

695
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:42,975
And for the negative beings.

696
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:43,475
It's here.

697
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:44,465
>>Yes.

698
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,105
>>In your stomach.

699
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,384
There's a feeling you get
right here in your gut.

700
00:39:47,654 --> 00:39:50,805
Something's not right.

701
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,575
Something is not right here.

702
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,395
When you get that feeling
that something is not right.

703
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,620
That's how you know, just, and you don't
have to be like, you don't have to go,

704
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,509
I'm gonna fight you guys right now.

705
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:02,520
You don't have to fight 'em.
>>Out comes the switchblades.

706
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,440
>>Yeah, exactly.

707
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:09,240
So you know, you just leave 'em alone
and you say, hey, a lot of times you, just leave

708
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,805
me alone, I don't wanna deal with you, 
they'll leave you alone.

709
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,560
I'm sure you get caught up the
wrong way for a long time a lot.

710
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:17,530
But for the most part it's - you
get that feeling in your gut.

711
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,890
You just say, just get out of my face.

712
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,100
>>Yeah.

713
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,640
>>To really trust that, and to really
bless them and release them with love.

714
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,740
>>Exactly.
>>Because they don't want that.

715
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:29,940
That's, they're not resonating,
so they're gonna leave much more

716
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,819
quickly than if someone...
>>Yeah.

717
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,680
>>yells and screams and...
>>Right.

718
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,029
>>Says, get outta here, then that..
>>That's what they feed off of.

719
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,950
>>That starts to create the..

720
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:44,625
>>There,

721
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,335
another warning that I have
there is a false light.

722
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,805
There are what I call things that hide.

723
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:50,305
>>Yeah, hide.

724
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:51,795
>>I hear that a lot.

725
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:52,365
>>Yeah.

726
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:52,934
>>Oh, yeah.

727
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:53,024
>>Yeah.

728
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:55,065
I call 'em the dark ones
that hide in the light.

729
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:55,785
>>That's...
>>Yes.

730
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,485
>>That's kind the name I gave
them because they do have this.

731
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:02,765
Oh hello.

732
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,065
How are you?

733
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:06,045
Please come with me.

734
00:41:06,045 --> 00:41:07,225
I got something to show you.

735
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:11,145
Here's the ascension chamber
you're gonna go into, and this

736
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:16,105
chamber is where you're gonna down
download all of your information.

737
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:18,135
You'll become a beautiful being.

738
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:21,075
But, and then, oh, here's
our cloning chambers.

739
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:22,965
Here's where we clone beings.

740
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:26,085
And clone things, and this is so nice.

741
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:30,645
And oh, and here's here's the controllers
or these, this is where your channel, a

742
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:34,705
lot of your channel messages come from,
but the whole time you'll feel this,

743
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:37,395
wait this...
>>Uneasy feeling in the stomach.

744
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:37,895
>>This doesn't feel right

745
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:38,715
doesn't feel right.

746
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:39,165
>>Yeah,

747
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:44,880
and what I like to do is, I will
always, this is just my way,

748
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,980
I will say do you serve
the divine light and love?

749
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,650
>>Yeah.

750
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:56,700
>>And right away, if they don't, I
can see the light dropping away

751
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,440
and then they know they've been
discovered and they're gonna take off.

752
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,310
>>Yeah.
>>Usually,

753
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,230
cuz I work with a lot of this, we just,
in terms of all kinds of spirit, cuz I

754
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,910
mean I've worked with this my whole life
in the spirit realm with people who call

755
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:19,460
me about different spirits and homes
or I had a woman who I worked with in

756
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:26,210
Australia recently who said three little
kittens showed up at the foot of my bed.

757
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,370
She said, I wasn't sure
cuz it was a dim light.

758
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,320
That for me, that was a
red flag to hear dim light.

759
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,060
And she said, and then they're, and
she said, but now they're not leaving.

760
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,220
And I said, oh, interesting.

761
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:49,060
So as we worked through some of that,
these were beings that camouflaged

762
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,610
themselves as cute little kitties.

763
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,890
And they were not cute little kitties.

764
00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:02,030
And because they can appear however
the person - ya know she loved kitties.

765
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,640
So and so I said, we need to release
them and move them out, which we did.

766
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:18,110
And they were not kitties, so they,
there's lots of interesting ways that

767
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,200
that they can camouflage in that.

768
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,210
>>And what was the term that you said?

769
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,759
Do you? The question you asked?
Do you serve the divine light?

770
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,710
>>I ask them if they serve
divine love and light.

771
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:37,170
>>So I sort of, so I, as you're saying that I felt
that it was more than just the words.

772
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,680
>>It's, I'm putting it out...
>>You're putting that out.

773
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,729
>>Even as I'm saying it right
now, I'm putting it out.

774
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:45,029
>>So maybe that's for people watching that.

775
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,799
>>Yeah.
>>You can't just say the words.

776
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,200
It's, you really have to
feel into what the..  

777
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,879
>>Right, I say it from my heart, from my soul.

778
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,540
And yes.

779
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,569
You can't just say divine light,

780
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:57,409
divine light, divine light...

781
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,850
>>No, it's like holding onto a cross and

782
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,640
Jesus, Jesus, or whatever.

783
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,279
>>You're freaked and going, divine light.

784
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:03,779
Divine light.

785
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:04,520
Divine light.

786
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,250
>>Exactly.

787
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,230
>>It's not gonna work very well.

788
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:08,790
It's centering and coming...

789
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,497
>>Yeah.

790
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:17,410
>>to the still point within the self, that
quiet place of heart within and then..

791
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,210
That's the first thing to do. 

792
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:24,371
And then to feel the love
and to really share that.

793
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,610
>>Yeah, you know what?

794
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:32,680
I've used when I, in my
ignorant time, I was learning, 

795
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,420
I thought you know what?

796
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,460
I gotta study all the different religions
and no respect to, disrespect to any

797
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,780
religions, and it had all people of all
religions need to forgive my ignorance

798
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,600
of their religion, but I decided I
wanna check out the whole Christianity

799
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,790
thing, and I did that at first.

800
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:57,260
I had this, the negative entity, pushing
me down, holding me down, and I did the

801
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,640
whole: 'In the name of Christ, I command you
to leave me, I command you to leave me.'

802
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,370
>>Right, okay.

803
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:08,850
>>And nothing, it still kept...ya know
I'm struggling and I, 'In the name of

804
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,170
Christ command you to leave me.'

805
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,370
And it wasn't until I was able to
break free and I had one of those

806
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:18,090
touch lights, alls I had to do was
turn the light on and it was gone.

807
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,160
>>Yeah.

808
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,340
>>It was all I had to
do, was turn the light on.

809
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:20,870
>>Wow.

810
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,830
>>And if you think about this analogy
here, if you go into a dark room right?

811
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,590
Alls you have to do is
turn the light on, right?

812
00:45:29,595 --> 00:45:30,810
And all the darkness goes.

813
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,700
>>Yeah.
>>And you still have your shadows.  >> Right.

814
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,090
But all the darkness goes away
and the brighter the light, the

815
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,410
least amount of shadows you have.

816
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,440
>>And I tell people to physically
turn light on.   >>Right.

817
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:44,340
>>Yeah,

818
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,030
physically light a white
candle, sometimes to just add, ya know, 

819
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:56,790
to do incense or something
that could really help shift the

820
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,490
energy of a household or something.

821
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,470
>>Wow.

822
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:05,310
So it sounds like even though you've had
all these, both of you guys have had these

823
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:12,180
extra terrestrial, so to say, otherworldly
experiences, you still are very in tune

824
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,670
to angels and moving energy in the room.

825
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:14,975
>>Absolutely.

826
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:18,029
>>And you say you don't see auras,
but you still have this sort of

827
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:21,779
feeling of different energies.

828
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,500
>>Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

829
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:29,310
>Oh, there's so many different
wonderful beings, species in

830
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,080
creation that it's just amazing.

831
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:40,605
I've had lots of encounters with
nature spirits, and being in my home

832
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:42,795
and around my home and talking to me.

833
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:43,625
And...

834
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,634
>>Would the experiences with ETs have
opened, you think that it's opened you

835
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:49,185
up to these other energies of things, or

836
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:50,505
is just, that's just naturally?

837
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:54,285
>>It's always been that way for me for some
reason, with the animal communication.

838
00:46:54,285 --> 00:47:01,365
And that it's just part of it and it's
just unfolded through my whole life.

839
00:47:01,395 --> 00:47:02,265
>>It's not one or the other.

840
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:03,395
It's a package.

841
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:06,375
>>It's, for me, it's been
a total package deal.

842
00:47:07,935 --> 00:47:08,375
>>Awesome.

843
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:15,734
>>I said, what was my soul
thinking coming in here?

844
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:20,944
Had a lot more in mind, than not
remembering what it might be like here.

845
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:25,305
>>Right, we probably didn't realize it
was gonna be soooo tough.

846
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:26,715
It's so tough.

847
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:27,545
Tough it is.
>>Correct.

848
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:28,455
Absolutely.

849
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:29,015
>>Yeah.

850
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:29,675
>>So different.

851
00:47:30,295 --> 00:47:30,815
It's oh yeah,

852
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,425
piece of cake,

853
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,075
not remembering that fractal thing.

854
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,515
I got that.

855
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:35,835
>>What it's like to be in density.

856
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,215
>>Yeah.

857
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:36,735
>>And yeah.

858
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:37,325
>>Yeah, 

859
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:42,765
imagine a master of the universe,
saying, looking down at this,

860
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,475
oh, I got this.
>>Piece of cake.

861
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,550
>>Piece of cake.
And then I'm going, Oh, whoaaaa.

862
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,055
>>And then we go through
it, and then we die.

863
00:47:50,055 --> 00:47:51,925
And then we're like, oh that was kinda fun.

864
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:52,425
>>Yeah.

865
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,645
>>Maybe let's go back and do it again.

866
00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:55,805
>>Do again.
>>Let's do it again.

867
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:56,965
I got this this time.

868
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:57,345
I got it.

869
00:47:57,345 --> 00:47:57,675
>>Exactly.

870
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:58,515
That's right.

871
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:00,615
>>Oh my goodness.

872
00:48:00,615 --> 00:48:07,615
But one thing the ETs have taught me
or talked to me about too is even well

873
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:15,165
from the human perspective that we can
go beyond what many people refer to as

874
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:17,964
the karmic wheel or that going round and round.

875
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:20,085
We don't have to keep
going round and round.

876
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:21,125
We can go

877
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:22,755
beyond that.

878
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,625
And make a choice to not do the looping.

879
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:27,165
Honestly.
>>Yeah.

880
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:34,154
>>That there are other ways that
we can choose to do all of that.

881
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:35,665
So I just wanted to...

882
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:39,675
>>And speaking of that, it seems the
message I've been getting with all

883
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:45,495
these interviews is we're at this
place and time in our evolution as

884
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:50,985
the humanities has been doing this
cycle for 25,000 years or more.

885
00:48:51,115 --> 00:48:52,835
>>Or more, yeah, definitely.

886
00:48:53,745 --> 00:49:02,045
>>But at least in this go around. That
we're, we are ending this karmic cycle

887
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:03,515
and going into something different here.

888
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:04,020
>>Yes.

889
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,410
>>Yeah.

890
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,210
>>Is that the messages you
guys have been getting?

891
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,319
>>The ascension event, that comes
up the whole ascension event,

892
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:11,970
right that I'm sure you've heard of?

893
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,890
And what is the ascension event?

894
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:20,070
And it's funny that you say 25,000
years ago, cuz what is at the, how far

895
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,370
is the distance between the sun and
the center of the milky way galaxy

896
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,860
is approximately 25 - 26,000 years.

897
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,530
>>Oh, interesting.

898
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,720
>>Okay.

899
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,230
>>So on a physical level, from
my understanding imagine this

900
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:39,404
to our astronomers are just now
discovering, you're seeing the light

901
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,275
from this event that happened.

902
00:49:41,555 --> 00:49:47,805
So about 25 to 26,000 years ago, a gas
cloud came in and fell into the center of

903
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:52,245
our black hole at the the super massive
black hole, the center of the galaxy.

904
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:56,955
And we really don't have any kind
of as a species, our scientists

905
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:00,765
can't really comprehend what the super
massive black hole is at the center.

906
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:06,040
When we need to fall, when the gas
cloud falls into the center it's

907
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,625
instantly converting all that
mass and matter into energy, right?

908
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:17,854
And it pulses, it brings, pushes
out this energetic pulse, right?

909
00:50:18,564 --> 00:50:23,145
We see in other galaxies and our own
galaxy before, remnants of previous

910
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:27,855
times where black hole woken up and
there's, there'd be a energetic beam

911
00:50:27,855 --> 00:50:30,215
that shoots up 50,000 light years.

912
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:32,714
One going up, one going down.

913
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,405
And so if you can imagine,

914
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:37,740
that's a lot of energy.

915
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,200
So what happens is this energetic
wave comes out from the center

916
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,590
of the galaxy, and it's traveling
near the speed of light.

917
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:52,549
The light itself takes 25 - 26,000 years
for astronomers, they're saying, okay there's

918
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,900
gas clouds going in, what happens next?

919
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,800
Right behind the light,
here comes the energy of it.

920
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,320
Just this wave.

921
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,049
Coming outwards.

922
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,470
And it changes everything.

923
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,640
It changes everything.

924
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,550
Now that's, from what I understand,
that's part of one of the reasons

925
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,880
why the ET started coming back.

926
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,430
Cuz it's okay the negativity's
getting outta hand here on

927
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,255
Earth, and here comes this wave.

928
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:27,090
What happens when this, it's a frequency,
what happens when this frequency gets

929
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:33,180
to Earth and Earth is going woooooo, and here
comes this wuuuuu, you know what's gonna happen?

930
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,840
>>Oh, okay.

931
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:35,085
>>Clash.

932
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:35,745
>>Chaos.
>>Yeah, chaos.

933
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:36,535
Okay.
I see.

934
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:37,305
Interesting.

935
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:39,285
>>So if you look at things..
>>A storm?

936
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:40,005
>>A storm,

937
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:40,655
exactly.

938
00:51:41,655 --> 00:51:45,885
So when this wave gets here, they want
to help try to raise the vibration to

939
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:47,855
get the planet, the frequency specific.

940
00:51:48,345 --> 00:51:51,705
So this galactic wave
doesn't hurt Earth, hurt us.

941
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:52,785
It just evolved...

942
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:55,075
>>The hot and cold pressures.

943
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:55,965
>>Exactly.

944
00:51:56,415 --> 00:51:57,855
>>Don't collide as hard.

945
00:51:57,855 --> 00:52:01,595
So you don't get a hurricane,
you get just a few raindrops.

946
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:07,595
>>They took me that ship that that I
witnessed, they took me up once and..

947
00:52:09,165 --> 00:52:11,565
The triangle ship?

948
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:12,255
>>Yeah.

949
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:12,615
>>Okay.

950
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:14,965
With these beings that you
don't even know who they were.

951
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,985
>>Yeah but the mantis be the mantis,

952
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:23,205
there was a mantis and zeta aboard that
craft, they use each other's ships.

953
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,345
>>Okay.
>>The experience was, ya know,

954
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:31,020
these beings, I wake up in the middle
of the night, and walk down the

955
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,670
hallway and there's like a French door.

956
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:37,470
It goes in the back and there's a tall
white zeta, if you will, standing there.

957
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,630
And he says, hey let me in.

958
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,900
I said, oh, I ain't gonna let you in, man.

959
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,280
There's no way.

960
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,450
So it says, okay, we're gonna do
this every night until you let me in.

961
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:52,300
And so I pass out, wake
up next night, same thing.

962
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,180
Let me in.

963
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,410
Alright, I'll let you in.

964
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,960
I crack the door open, it sticks it's hand
through, and I slam the door on his hand.

965
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,150
It's fighting, and pulls away.

966
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,290
It's rubbing its hand.

967
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,040
It sits down.

968
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,670
I sit down, we stare at each other, and
he is it's okay, man, but we're gonna

969
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,290
sit here and do this until you let me in.

970
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,080
And finally the third night, I let him
in and, all right, here, let's do this.

971
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,670
And he's like, all right, follow me.

972
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,490
I go up with him, and there's that.

973
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:25,185
Triangle craft floating above
me and it pulls me up into it.

974
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:29,475
And next thing I know, he's standing
in front of the view screen.

975
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,455
It's like view screen.

976
00:53:32,024 --> 00:53:33,705
And he's - come here.

977
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:34,365
Look at this.

978
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:35,325
And I, okay.

979
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,154
I walk and it's all telepathy.

980
00:53:37,754 --> 00:53:38,115
Okay?

981
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:39,134
So I walk up and

982
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:46,095
we're over the valley, where I live, where I
lived, the Salinas Valley and there's

983
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:48,255
a, there's like Northern Lights, right?

984
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:53,595
But red and orange, just like
translucent energy, but it wasn't

985
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:55,545
in the sky and it was on the ground.

986
00:53:56,055 --> 00:54:00,585
And I remember going, oh yeah, I'm
just seeing the world end because I

987
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:05,025
was listening to the, I think his name,
oh, one of the remote viewers that

988
00:54:05,115 --> 00:54:06,885
talk about this kill shot of the sun.

989
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:07,995
Oh, Ed Dames?

990
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,735
>>Yeah.
>>Oh don't listen to Ed Dames.

991
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:14,295
>>I thought for sure that's what I saw.

992
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:16,635
I thought, I was like, oh my God,
you guys are showing me the kill

993
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:18,345
shot that destroys everything.

994
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:20,145
Don't be silly.

995
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:21,695
That's not what this is.

996
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,265
That's not what this, what they showed me.

997
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:27,285
It's this energetic wave that
comes from the central black hole.

998
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:30,765
And it's more of a hug from the creator.

999
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:32,665
>>Yeah.
>>The best way I can put it.

1000
00:54:32,665 --> 00:54:38,245
Hopefully it snaps the minds of
humanity up to be like, there's more

1001
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:41,665
to this universe than just these walls,

1002
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:43,134
>>And just humans.

1003
00:54:43,134 --> 00:54:46,115
>>and the couch, there's
more to it.

1004
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:46,655
>>Yeah.

1005
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:51,694
>>And, but it goes, it even
goes further than that too.

1006
00:54:53,095 --> 00:54:55,995
How would I describe this?

1007
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,275
Imagine yourself as you are now, right?

1008
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:03,625
And you look forward, you
look backwards, right?

1009
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:07,585
If, imagine all these different
strings, they come from your center,

1010
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:09,955
there's all these different
strings that kind of go off in

1011
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,845
infinite amount of directions, right?

1012
00:55:12,285 --> 00:55:15,235
That is what that is, is represents

1013
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:19,705
at this point, there's an infinite amount
of possibilities for me to do, right?

1014
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:23,055
An infinite amount of possibilities.
Behind me is the same.

1015
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:26,415
There's an infinite amount of
possibilities that got me here, right?

1016
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:30,375
So an infinite amount of possibilities
that got me here and an infinite amount of

1017
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,685
possibilities for where I'm gonna go.

1018
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:34,115
Okay.

1019
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:40,495
We experience these
possibilities simultaneously.

1020
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:43,935
The thing that my little spark is, is
kinda like a little zipper that

1021
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:46,425
pulls all these experiences together.

1022
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:47,710
The singularity

1023
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,485
if you will, pulls all these experiences
together and then now my spark gets

1024
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,105
to choose which way I'm gonna go.

1025
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:54,705
>>Yeah.
>>Of course

1026
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:59,355
it's hard for me to jump from, cuz this
spark is experiencing this spectrum.

1027
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:04,845
I can't just jump to this spectrum,
I have to navigate through the bars.

1028
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:05,265
>>Yeah.

1029
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:05,765
>>Okay, so

1030
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,385
but we split, we're constantly splitting.

1031
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:11,910
And we're experiencing every possibility.

1032
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:16,785
Now what happens when this happens over
countless numbers of thousands of years.

1033
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:21,745
Now if we go back to,
everything's a fractal of itself.

1034
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:26,745
What happens in our universe
as far as we know, when something

1035
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:29,685
gets too big for its britches,
let's take a star for an example.

1036
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:34,045
When a star gets too big, it
collapses in on itself, right?

1037
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:37,545
Becomes a supernova black
hole, a white dwarf, whatever.

1038
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:45,545
But it's becoming a new,it's becoming
a new divine expression of creation.

1039
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:47,174
It wants to experience, oh, I'm too big.

1040
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:48,705
Let's experience something new.

1041
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:55,214
So we have all these lines that go
out and we've got, we've exhausted it.

1042
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:58,015
On this planet, we've exhausted
all the possibilities.

1043
00:56:58,305 --> 00:56:59,575
So now it's gotten too big.

1044
00:56:59,905 --> 00:57:01,875
So it's like now our possibilities are

1045
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:04,259
collapsing in on themselves.

1046
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:07,109
It's just one big... >> The timelines. >>compression.

1047
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,910
Yeah, the timelines and everything.

1048
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,120
It's a compression.

1049
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,190
So we're experiencing all these
possible realities simultaneously.

1050
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:14,930
And now they're...

1051
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,310
>>Within the limitations
of the third density.

1052
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:17,879
>>Exactly.

1053
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:18,180
>>Okay.

1054
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:24,520
>>And now they're collapsing in on
themselves and we become a new

1055
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,190
expression of divine creation.

1056
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,330
>>Fourth density consciousness.

1057
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,060
>>And how do you want to
experience that event is up to

1058
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,680
how you want to experience it.

1059
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:32,100
>>Gotcha.

1060
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,669
>>If it's gonna be a world ending
event, then that's how you're

1061
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,310
gonna experience your collapse.

1062
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,060
You hear about the collapse of the
economy, the collapse of society.

1063
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,599
>>Yeah.

1064
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,719
>>Collapse, collapse, collapse.

1065
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,379
So it's a collapse of
possible possibility...

1066
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,779
>>Of that those old
paradigm ways of doing things.

1067
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:54,040
Because we've exhausted the, we cannot
continue to do things in that way.

1068
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,310
>>And somehow the

1069
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,740
trigger is this energetic wave from
the black hole that's coming in now.

1070
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,330
That's what triggers the collapse.

1071
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,440
>>It aligns right with all the
other teachings and sayings,

1072
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,884
the harmonic convergence of '87.

1073
00:58:09,884 --> 00:58:14,370
>>And yeah, there are so many
potential people will ask me

1074
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,620
what's absolutely going to happen?

1075
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:20,790
There are so many possibilities.

1076
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:25,089
I'm just saying this a little
different way, but kinda the same, of timelines,

1077
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:29,790
there are all those choices that,
or potentials, that can happen

1078
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,400
depending on what humanity chooses.

1079
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,980
Also collectively.

1080
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,690
>>Yeah.

1081
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:39,390
>>And but each soul gets
to choose their journey,

1082
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,310
journey as well.

1083
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:50,910
For me, a very key message of what we term
ascension is basically about humanity

1084
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:51,870
remembering

1085
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:55,785
that they are one with everything.

1086
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,095
We are all one.

1087
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:00,595
That we are cosmic citizens.

1088
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:11,095
And that expansion in consciousness
and that on Earth that, that we need

1089
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:15,524
to come together in cooperation.

1090
00:59:15,904 --> 00:59:18,064
And to live from our hearts.

1091
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:24,524
And in doing that, then there is
no need for the greed, the war,

1092
00:59:25,014 --> 00:59:26,704
and struggle.

1093
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:32,325
If we all come to that
remembrance that we are divine.

1094
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:34,665
That, that we are all divine.

1095
00:59:35,145 --> 00:59:40,814
So in the end it's, for me that
is a big part of our message as

1096
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:45,855
hybrids or my, what we to share.

1097
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:53,234
And but the message I think is
being a hybrid is really to help

1098
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:55,725
people understand we are all cosmic.

1099
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:57,995
They are family.

1100
00:59:58,935 --> 01:00:01,325
Really they are us and we are them.

1101
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:08,084
And they are evolving
just as we are evolving.

1102
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:09,705
They've told me this over and over.

1103
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,435
You think you're the
only ones going through...

1104
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:12,915
>>Yeah.

1105
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:13,575
>>the process,

1106
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:17,545
they go, we're going through
this process as well.

1107
01:00:17,545 --> 01:00:19,095
It's all of creation.

1108
01:00:19,544 --> 01:00:26,895
Moving through this incredible process
that is just an inspiring, and in the

1109
01:00:26,895 --> 01:00:30,884
end it does come out to a new creation.

1110
01:00:30,884 --> 01:00:32,235
And I like to

1111
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:34,919
talk about the new human.

1112
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:40,830
That's why I call it the new
human awakening and coming into

1113
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,259
being a new creation in that way.

1114
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,540
And so I think, and that's what
we're, that's what we are here for,

1115
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,560
bottom line.
>>This new

1116
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:54,930
consciousness comes with a
new whole set of DNA upgrades.

1117
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,560
>>Absolutely.

1118
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:07,350
The DNA shift, and and all of that is,
is happening in terms of the energy

1119
01:01:07,979 --> 01:01:11,700
just cosmically, it's just happening.

1120
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:12,205
>>Yeah.

1121
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:19,019
>>It, the creations where all the
creations expression and creation is

1122
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,319
shifting and evolving all the time.

1123
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:27,209
And so we're in an opportunity, this
is a period of time on Earth that we

1124
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:30,540
have the opportunity to really embrace

1125
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:33,404
and remember who we really are.
>>Right.

1126
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:42,165
>>We're not these bodies, we're
not Joe Accountant or

1127
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:42,884
whoever.

1128
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:49,404
That is not our main I identity
or the car, the, all of that.

1129
01:01:49,424 --> 01:01:55,335
That's the whole illusion
that we're evolving out of.

1130
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,484
>>I'll give you this real quick.

1131
01:01:59,524 --> 01:02:03,855
Our scientists actually have, and they,
most people don't even think about

1132
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:08,685
this, but our scientists on Earth,
they've actually came up with a oneness

1133
01:02:08,685 --> 01:02:10,665
theory, and that's the Big Bang theory.

1134
01:02:10,845 --> 01:02:11,685
>>Yeah.
>>Think about this.

1135
01:02:11,955 --> 01:02:14,884
They say that all matter
originated from a single point.

1136
01:02:15,555 --> 01:02:17,504
If you put your finger out
for me, Jacqueline, right?

1137
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:18,785
So imagine this.

1138
01:02:19,225 --> 01:02:25,424
It took, as far as scientists know, 14.5
billion years for that atom and that atom

1139
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,464
to come together again.

1140
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:33,164
So if you imagine not only is it a
physical, not only is it a physical part

1141
01:02:33,164 --> 01:02:38,774
that we all came from the central point
in the universe to reconnect again.

1142
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:46,095
Imagine that singularity is also
consciousness and our consciousness split.

1143
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:52,634
And now it took 14.5 billion years
for me to meet you in these forms.

1144
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:55,949
The same as this atom here was in a star.

1145
01:02:56,919 --> 01:03:02,279
>>And it's going back the other direction,
but it's happening at the same time.

1146
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,384
So it's expanding and contracting
at the same time.

1147
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:05,765
>>Yeah.
>>Yes.

1148
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:06,504
It's pretty, yeah.

1149
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:10,604
>>Separating and coming together for all of
eternity, just trying to figure out what

1150
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:15,134
we are, because it's a being that just
came into consciousness saying, what am I?

1151
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:16,785
>>And yeah.

1152
01:03:16,785 --> 01:03:17,464
>>It's beautiful.

1153
01:03:18,784 --> 01:03:19,605
Thank you so much.

1154
01:03:19,605 --> 01:03:22,334
This has been a very enlightening
interview and thank you.

1155
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,625
Thank you for sharing.

1156
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:28,914
And I thank the mantis beings
for providing an opportunity

1157
01:03:28,944 --> 01:03:31,694
to talk about them a little

1158
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:32,145
bit.

1159
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:32,924
>>Definitely get this out.

1160
01:03:32,924 --> 01:03:33,915
>>We love it.

1161
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:34,415
>>Yeah.
