1
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,472
Mother Earth is currently rebalancing herself.

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:20,520
Many imbalances have taken 
place through the years. 

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,108
This really gives us the 
opportunity to go

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,778
within, to listen to our heart and soul,

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:34,075
and to become still in the midst 
of the chaos and the fear. 

6
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:39,789
It's a time to be loving and 
compassionate with ourselves

7
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,125
and with others globally. 

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,003
We need to remember that we're all one.

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:52,177
This is an opportunity for humankind 
to come together

10
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,512
 and to support each other. 

11
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,433
So let's focus on what we have in common.

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:06,399
We are all human ...and set aside 
the mind and the ego differences.

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:15,075
And the Earth has been letting us 
know that we need to respect her

14
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,913
in a much deeper way than we have.

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:26,795
Let us listen to our hearts and 
our souls and learn to live in 

16
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:34,761
harmony and balance with each other, 
with ourselves and with Mother Earth

17
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:41,017
It's a challenge to not get lost 
in the fear, I know that's happening. 

18
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,645
And the star beings as well 

19
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,398
are assisting us during this time.

20
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,874
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

21
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,292
life elsewhere in the universe?

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,170
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

23
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,506
My name is Reuben Langdon.

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,886
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

25
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,015
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,516
Coincidentally, I was working on

27
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,768
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

28
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,105
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

29
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,066
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

30
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,777
...are they here with us?

31
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,285
If beings of higher intelligent are here...

32
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,120
...what is their purpose?

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,831
Why don't they make themselves more known?

34
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
Why the secrecy?

35
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,294
I've asked these questions to many experts,

36
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,963
yet each seems to have a different theory.

37
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,424
So I thought to myself, 

38
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,010
why not ask the aliens directly?

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,054
So that's what I set out to do!

40
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,430
Well, sort of...

41
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,362
>> Robert and Jacqueline,
thank you for being here.

42
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:45,618
You say that you're hybrid
human extraterrestrial,

43
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,706
and you have actually
DNA that's hybridized,

44
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:55,503
and you've also had just an
amazing set of encounters

45
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,381
and experiences ongoing
with different beings,

46
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,300
so I'd love to get into that.

47
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,846
And it seems that we're all
hybrids to some extent.

48
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,347
Did any of the
beings that you've

49
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,935
interacted with sort of tell
you what the basic human soup

50
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,814
genetics-- did they mention
which ones are involved?

51
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:19,944
>> I don't know all of the
races that were involved.

52
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,988
I would think-- a
lot of people say

53
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,491
there's 12 original races
that came down and started

54
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,994
messing with our DNA.

55
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,287
It sounds right to me.

56
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:34,459
I do know that these beings
have been modifying human DNA

57
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,545
since humans have been human.

58
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,297
They've been doing
this for thousands

59
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,759
upon thousands of
years, you know?

60
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,635
But as far as what
species, I'm not

61
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,805
too exactly sure which ones.

62
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,848
Do you know which?

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,436
>> Well, I do believe
the Anunnaki are key,

64
00:05:53,436 --> 00:06:00,651
pretty key in terms of having
a hand with altering, or--

65
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,279
I'm not quite sure
how to say that.

66
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,489
>> Genetically manipulating--

67
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,492
>> With creating
some of the genetics.

68
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:12,830
And I was told that there is
a council of beings who kind

69
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,417
of were-- they created
this experiment,

70
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:23,091
and that they all had a hand
in putting in different--

71
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,260
all of their DNA
in different ways

72
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,098
in terms of seeing
how that might go.

73
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,976
>> So we all could be literally
walking hybrids of different

74
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,186
species, different things.

75
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:35,978
>> Totally.

76
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,771
Totally.

77
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:44,112
>> And I think the reason we've
been asked to step forward

78
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:49,826
as hybrids is we have-- this
is the way I think about it.

79
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,163
We have a much higher
frequency of star beingness

80
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,083
than most other people.

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,254
And we are weird, or
different, or fringe,

82
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,884
or however you want to
say that with our skills.

83
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,971
I've had wild things
happen through my life.

84
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,266
>> During many of my interviews,
I've talked to people who are

85
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,811
sort of telepathic
or have abilities.

86
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,647
And a lot of them say
around the age six,

87
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,567
I was visited by a
thing, or I saw a saucer,

88
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,196
and it seems to be an ongoing
theme that they probably

89
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,740
already had it in them, but this
experience sort of woke them

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,658
up.
>> Activated.

91
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,451
>> Activated it.

92
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,996
Do you guys recall
around that age having--

93
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,039
>> I got my implants
when I was five.

94
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,416
>> Five, OK.

95
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,837
This goes to the ignorance
thing of a five-year-old.

96
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,214
I remember when I was--

97
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,007
what is five?

98
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,175
Like first grade?

99
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:47,508
Kindergarten?

100
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,092
Around there?

101
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:48,426
>> Kindergarten.

102
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,844
>> Yeah.
>> Kindergarten?

103
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,848
I remember going to
the school library,

104
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,766
and the librarian
would be reading books

105
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,977
and they would talk-- it
was a book about a kid that

106
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,604
had cancer, right?

107
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,772
And the kid was talking
about how he was feeling

108
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,858
these lumps in his mouth.

109
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,903
And it wasn't like
just, I would say

110
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,574
a week after I heard that
book, I was feeling two lumps

111
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,451
under my tongue.

112
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,120
And I remember going to my
mom, mom, mom, there's lumps--

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,371
there's lumps under my tongue.

114
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,873
There's lumps under my tongue.

115
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,665
I got cancer.

116
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,500
I got cancer.

117
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,711
She's like, oh, no, son, there's
lumps under everybody's tongue.

118
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,879
So I just kind of like--

119
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,297
I always played with them.

120
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,841
They stressed out, like,
I know it's cancer.

121
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,759
I know it's cancer.

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,218
But--

123
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,302
>> I'm feeling around
my mouth right now.

124
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,513
I'm like, oh, I think
I feel some lumps too.

125
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,347
>> Yeah, right?

126
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,015
But you know, I actually--

127
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,476
I can grab them
and pull on them.

128
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,270
Even my dentist doesn't quite
really know what they are.

129
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,063
>> Oh, wow.

130
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,065
>> One's about the
size of a little--

131
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,691
like, shaped like a teardrop.

132
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,402
It's a grain of rice, but like
a size of a grain of rice.

133
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,405
And then the other one's
like a little tiny ball.

134
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,198
>> Interesting.

135
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,783
>> And they flip.

136
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,451
You can flip them
around and everything.

137
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,745
>> You can flip the--

138
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,871
no, that would be freaky.

139
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,705
OK.

140
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,832
>> But yeah, so it
started at five.

141
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,669
Five is when I got
those implants put in.

142
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,461
>> Interesting.

143
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,005
So that's the implant--
those are implants.

144
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:08,798
>> Yeah.

145
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,590
>> Interesting.

146
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,260
And at that age, were they--
were you sort of aware

147
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,303
and told that you
were getting implants?

148
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,096
Or you were just--

149
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:15,888
>> Oh I'm totally unaware.

150
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,430
>> Or that came later.

151
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,265
>> Totally unaware, yeah.

152
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,015
It came later.

153
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,808
>> All right.

154
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,935
And these are from
the Mantis beings?

155
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,852
>> I believe so, yeah.

156
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,856
>> OK, well, speaking
of Mantis beings,

157
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,069
I've had sort of a personal
experience recently with them.

158
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,947
And it's interesting
because I haven't--

159
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:37,493
during all these interviews I
do with different ET collectives

160
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,120
and individuals,
you know, you hear

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,917
about the Zeta Reticuli, the
Pleiades, the Arcturus and even

162
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,002
Reptilians.

163
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:51,132
But the Mantis hadn't
really been in my radar.

164
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,594
And then I had this experience
with this Mantis energy.

165
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,262
That's all I can say, you know.

166
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,142
I identified it as the
Mantis because I had seen--

167
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,437
in this world, you read and
it pops up every now and then.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,982
But it hasn't been really
explored and discussed.

169
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,819
So I'd really like to sort
of get your viewpoints

170
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,197
on what are the Mantis beings.

171
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,034
What do they-- why
are they interacting

172
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,202
with humans in this way?

173
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:25,499
And sort of just your
personal take on that energy.

174
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,711
>> I've noticed that too when I
was starting to do my research

175
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,839
on the subject, trying to figure
out what was going on with me.

176
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,175
I noticed that there is
not a lot of information

177
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,510
out there about the
Mantis beings at all.

178
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,679
You know, there is that
the Mantis beings created

179
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,474
the Gray race, you know.

180
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,725
But--

181
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,393
>> I didn't hear that.

182
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,605
But that resonates now with
the download that I got.

183
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,316
So thank you for sharing.

184
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,320
>> So what I understand from
the Mantis beings is that,

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,323
there's many praying mantis insects running

186
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,452
around, different species,
different looks, different--

187
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,828
and it's the same out there.

188
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:08,167
But from what I understand
is that they were here

189
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,002
at the very beginning.

190
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,922
You know, they were, like,
one of the first aspects

191
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,592
of creation in the universe,
of physical creation.

192
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,679
If you think everything is
kind of like a fractal, right,

193
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,848
of the whole, you
know, here on Earth,

194
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,726
if you think of Earth as far
as humanity knows how evolution

195
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,563
went, you first have
your bacterial life

196
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,357
and then more complex forms.

197
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,110
And then finally, you get
into the insects, and then

198
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,404
the amphibians and
the reptiles, right?

199
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,823
Because the
conditions are harsh.

200
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,243
So you need that
exoskeleton first.

201
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,830
So I believe-- and that's where
you're more negative Mantis

202
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,664
being comes from.

203
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,583
It's just-- the universe
is just created.

204
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,127
And it's chaos.

205
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,128
It's--

206
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,670
>> Survival of the fittest.

207
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,212
>> --radioactive.

208
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,839
It's survival of the
fittest, you know,

209
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,676
so I believe that's where your
negative Mantis comes from.

210
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,637
Then they evolve
to the next stage,

211
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,598
where now, they're not
so negative, you know?

212
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,851
And then evolve to the next
stage, to the next stage,

213
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,768
and to the next stage.

214
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,770
But since there
they've been evolving

215
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,859
for countless billions
of years, they

216
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,779
exist on every single
level simultaneously

217
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,116
because as we know it, time
is more circular than it

218
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,076
is linear, as we experience it.

219
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:30,833
So they exist just on
every level simultaneously.

220
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,501
The ones that we
interact with, they've

221
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,379
evolved beyond
their exoskeleton.

222
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,965
So they don't have the
harder shell anymore.

223
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,927
And they're extremely
benevolent and extremely loving.

224
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,430
The reason why they're here
interacting with Earth,

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,473
these are creator beings.

226
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,394
If you imagine,
they're so evolved

227
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,897
that just one of
their consciousness

228
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,399
has the ability to be
aware of everyone's

229
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,194
conscious-- every living
things' conscious on the planet.

230
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,322
It can literally encompass
an entire galaxy,

231
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,657
whereas we can only
experience and comprehend

232
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,576
these walls around us.

233
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,704
Because I can only see and
perceive what's around me.

234
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:13,000
They have the ability to
perceive galaxies, you know.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,085
So they're just here.

236
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:20,674
I think they're just here mostly
to observe but just to help.

237
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,385
And alls they want to do
is help humanity evolve.

238
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,388
And they also want to
help create new divine

239
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,724
expressions of creation.

240
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,018
So that's pretty much
why they're here.

241
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:31,852
>> Interesting.

242
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,397
Jacquelin, you want to
piggyback off of that?

243
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,527
>> Yeah, I've had a lot of
interaction with the Mantis

244
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,319
beings.

245
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,952
And when they come and
talk to me-- and also,

246
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,746
I do star origin
readings for people.

247
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,041
So a lot of the times--

248
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,627
well, a number of times,
those people will be Mantis.

249
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:01,465
So I get to have the
interaction with different types

250
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,758
of Mantis beings.

251
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,762
And then I'm clairvoyant so
they show me where they're from.

252
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:15,688
And actually, I go there from
that frequency, I'll call it.

253
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,275
And what they have
shared with me is--

254
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:24,613
I agree in that they
are very, very highly--

255
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,948
one of the most--

256
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,743
I believe, one of the most
highly evolved cultures,

257
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:34,582
and that they did certainly
have a hand in creating,

258
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:40,671
and creation, in creating
the universe as we know it.

259
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:45,467
And some other races do as well.

260
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,888
But the Mantis,
they are very highly

261
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,474
evolved beings,
incredible healers.

262
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,103
And they're very playful.

263
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,314
They love to laugh and have fun.

264
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:03,652
So they show up at my
house all the time.

265
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,529
And I-- they like to dance.

266
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,240
It sounds silly, but they
like to do movements.

267
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,078
And one morning I was
actually laying in bed.

268
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,457
And eight of them
showed up in my bedroom.

269
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,708
This was very calming for me.

270
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,500
Yeah.

271
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,586
And I go, good morning.

272
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:25,049
And they said, we would love for
you to get up and move with us,

273
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,425
or some people might say dance.

274
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,676
And that sounds kind of silly.

275
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,638
But they have--

276
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,181
>> A little more than exercise.

277
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:37,186
>> Any being that has
evolved understands play,

278
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,065
the concept of play
and joy and laughter.

279
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,735
And I said, oh, I don't
want to, but I will.

280
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,863
>> [LAUGHS] Talk about
getting dragged out of bed

281
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,656
in the morning.

282
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,114
>> I was.

283
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,990
I was dragged out.

284
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,617
>> Could they at
least make you coffee?

285
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,202
>> I was complaining.

286
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,663
And so I got out of bed, OK.

287
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,331
And I started moving.

288
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:03,170
And my whole neck snapped.

289
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,256
My whole spinal column aligned,
and my whole neck snapped.

290
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,510
And they had aligned my whole
spinal column and neck just

291
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,302
like that.

292
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,345
>> Wow.

293
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,139
>> And so I thanked
them for that.

294
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,267
>> So like a cosmic
chiropractic appointment.

295
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
>> Absolutely.

296
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,689
>> And so they interact.

297
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,357
And they come to
me, and I draw a lot

298
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:28,070
of the symbols they give
me to share with others.

299
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:36,286
And actually, yes-- so I have
interactions with them often.

300
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,000
And even though they're very
high creators, and where

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,841
they come from, where I have
visited, they just of course

302
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,594
all telepathically communicate,
because they're energy.

303
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:58,392
And they have showed a little
about their culture with me.

304
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:03,355
And there's a temple that I've
been to at least six times.

305
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,108
That's just-- it's like a
crystalline temple that's

306
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,901
a spiral.

307
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,530
And they've taken me
through, showing this to me.

308
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,782
And I've been
through the spiral.

309
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,035
And earlier on, what
the Mantis beings

310
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:22,666
did was invite other
cultures, other races

311
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,129
to come that they felt were
ready to come and engage

312
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,676
with being a part of a--

313
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,305
it's not really a ritual
but with experiencing

314
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,057
this crystalline
temple where they

315
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,935
would go through the spiral.

316
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:48,817
And it would actually
help their DNA to evolve.

317
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,737
>> So the actual physical
structure of the temple was

318
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,905
like a spiral form.

319
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,697
>> Yes.

320
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,034
It's-- and it's not
density like here.

321
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:02,206
It's more of an etheric,
crystalline frequency.

322
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,626
It's just incredibly beautiful.

323
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,755
So I have a very high respect.

324
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,051
But yet, they're very
playful and can be very silly

325
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:23,060
and give you information
that's just amazing.

326
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,687
On this New Year's Eve--

327
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,316
I was sharing with
Rob that eight of them

328
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,609
showed up at my house.

329
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,152
There was a white Mantis being,

330
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,905
so there's different species.

331
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:39,868
Some show up to me as being
a neon purple, blue green.

332
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,869
There's brown.

333
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,163
There's all these
different species.

334
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,164
So they all showed up.

335
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:48,502
And they were around
me most of the day.

336
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,212
And I understood
they were preparing

337
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:56,593
me to write down this DNA
code from them, which I did.

338
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,347
And after I wrote
it down, I shook--

339
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
my body shook for half
an hour because it

340
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,018
was such high frequency.

341
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,104
And I thanked them
because I was so

342
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:15,153
moved that I could have the
opportunity to allow that,

343
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,823
to just sit and come through.

344
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,784
And actually, it
was on the screen

345
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,369
when I had given my talk.

346
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,580
>> Oh, OK.

347
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,998
>> And actually-- yeah.

348
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:36,466
So-- but they're very loving,
kind, compassionate fun, fun,

349
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,677
fun beings.

350
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,432
>>Would you have any idea of
what dimension or density

351
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,728
that the majority of
these beings reside in?

352
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,771
>> Well, you're asking
about the Mantis.

353
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,481
>> Yes, the Mantis being.

354
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,609
>>From my perspective--
and again, there's

355
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,986
different species that are
in different frequencies.

356
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,778
>> Yeah.

357
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:05,579
>> Those who I interact with,
I would classify them more with

358
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,665
the angelic realm definitely.

359
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,752
And when they appear
to people sometimes,

360
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,672
they will appear with the
wings to not scare people.

361
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,049
And they're not truly wings.

362
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,344
It's their energy around them.

363
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,222
But that's how highly
evolved they are.

364
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,808
>> So it's almost beyond
physical form in a collective.

365
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,726
>> Absolutely.

366
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,518
Yes.

367
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:34,441
>> The best way to describe
it, it's like a drop of water

368
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,486
in an ocean of consciousness
is what it is really.

369
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:42,157
And there is a singular
consciousness amongst them.

370
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,451
But they do have a--

371
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,619
it's not a hive mind.

372
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,536
It's a collective.

373
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,329
>> A collective.

374
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,122
>> It's like an ocean
of consciousness.

375
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,292
>> Yeah, we've explored-- in
past episodes we've explored

376
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,628
Peleiadian collectives,
different densities

377
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,046
and dimensions of
the collectives.

378
00:20:56,046 --> 00:21:01,468
And it sort of seems that
from seventh and beyond,

379
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,387
individuals sort of lose their--

380
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,179
they don't lose it.

381
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,308
They still have their individual
experiences and ideas.

382
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,310
But then they start
operating from

383
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,104
a collective consciousness.

384
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,149
>> Well, and there's
no ego involved.

385
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,696
Humanity, we have the ego,
and we need the ego here.

386
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,614
But they don't.

387
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,285
It's a whole
'nother experience--

388
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,327
>> Yeah, it is a weight--

389
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,205
>> --without the
ego, they understand,

390
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,457
they know the oneness.

391
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,291
We do too.

392
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,918
You know, everyone really does.

393
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,752
It's remembering.

394
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:40,757
But it's just
there all the time.

395
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,178
It's a oneness, the love,
the harmony, the peace.

396
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,931
>> Yeah.

397
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,019
It's a curious-- you know,
it's infinite curiosity

398
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,811
is what it is.

399
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,770
Because--

400
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,481
>> Curiosity on
their behalf or--

401
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,567
>> They-- they're just curious.

402
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,820
And it gets into how
the universe was created

403
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,739
and why we're all curious.

404
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,948
>> We're all curious.

405
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,782
>> It's interesting.

406
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,868
The download I got-- and
you mentioned angels.

407
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,955
So I sort of made
the correlation.

408
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:17,836
So this-- the visitation I
had was on the lunar eclipse.

409
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,421
>> What perfect timing.

410
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,299
>> Yeah, when was it, the
end of September last year?

411
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,091
>> Yes.

412
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,884
Oh.

413
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,928
>> And it went on
for a couple hours.

414
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,348
And I was shaking and
got a full on experience.

415
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,183
And I've never had--

416
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,935
I've been doing this kind
of work and interviews

417
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,021
and everything and ET
realms for a long time,

418
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,774
but I've never had a
personal experience.

419
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,900
>> That's wonderful.

420
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,613
>> And I was sort of getting
this download of the creation

421
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:50,077
not of the universe but
of the human experience.

422
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,245
And then I related--

423
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:57,375
so the Zetas came up,
the Grays, and also,

424
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,711
a lot of Reptilian
stuff came up.

425
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,880
And I sort of saw--

426
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,802
they were presenting to me
telepathically images of--

427
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,097
and what I was I guess
translating in my own--

428
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,057
with these images,
having to translate,

429
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,935
and feelings, and all sorts
of stuff was happening.

430
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:23,235
But I saw how Reptilians
saw them as Angels.

431
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,278
Does that resonate?

432
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,988
>> Yeah, if you think
about it, you know,

433
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,574
you hear a lot of abduction
experiences where the Mantis

434
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:34,621
beings always
playing an observer role.

435
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:39,042
They work with every--

436
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,836
all the beings, all of them.

437
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,551
They don't like to-- they don't
interfere with the other races

438
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,803
so much, you know?

439
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,471
They're just they're
mostly to observe,

440
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,308
to understand every
aspect of creation.

441
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,227
And so a lot of
the time, they're

442
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,020
just there as observers.

443
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,230
>> Yeah, that's--

444
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,652
I got that there was a distress
call from the Reptilians

445
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,071
in a way that they
wanted to evolve,

446
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,909
I guess, out of their
Reptilian archetypal structure.

447
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,539
And in order to do so, they
called upon the Mantis,

448
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,208
just like we would pray
to an Angel in that sense.

449
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,294
And then the Mantis
beings came in.

450
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,839
And I guess that's how
the human experience was

451
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,800
formed, to help the evolution
of this Reptilian consciousness.

452
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,469
>>They also have--

453
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,304
I do know they also have--

454
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,139
they have symbiotic
relationships

455
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:39,436
with a lot of beings too
because for an example,

456
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,896
there's is a race of beings.

457
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,063
They would look like a Gray.

458
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,817
They look just like a
Gray, except for the ones

459
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,821
that I've seen there,
they have a small head.

460
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,656
They're really short,
like, three feet tall,

461
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,160
wear a black
jumpsuit type thing.

462
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,829
They have these
lines on their faces

463
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,456
that are just like wrinkles.

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,837
And they were
created so that way,

465
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,006
the Mantis beings can
interact with lower dimensions

466
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,926
sometimes.

467
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,510
A lot of times,
when the Mantis work

468
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,766
with me, these little Gray
guys, who act as a barrier of--

469
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,811
because I've had an
experience where I was eating.

470
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:26,691
My wife made some jalapeno--
bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers.

471
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,527
She put the toothpick into it.

472
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,654
And I was just
gobbling them down.

473
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,364
And I accidentally
swallowed a toothpick.

474
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,990
>> Oh, no.

475
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,991
>> And so--

476
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,285
I was like, OK, well,
it doesn't hurt me now.

477
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,828
I had a little upset
stomach, but I'm

478
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,538
going to have to deal
with this tomorrow.

479
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,625
It's like 12 o'clock at night.

480
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,627
I mean, I'm really bad
about going to the doctor

481
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,087
when I'm supposed to.

482
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,131
But next thing I know, I feel--

483
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,925
my body starts stretching out.

484
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,636
And I'll see these
little beings walk in

485
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,304
and the Mantis
being behind them.

486
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,058
The Mantis being says, you know,
this is going to feel weird.

487
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,270
And the little guy puts
his hand in my stomach,

488
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,813
and it goes into my stomach.

489
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,941
If you've ever a hand
go into your stomach,

490
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,651
it's the weirdest feeling ever.

491
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,780
So I snapped out of it,
out of my paralysis.

492
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,994
And I grabbed the
being by the head.

493
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,830
And I had my thumb in
it's mouth, you know?

494
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,331
And it's chewing on my thumb.

495
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,876
I could feel it's little
gums, and it's saliva,

496
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,920
and it's soft skin.

497
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,340
And the Mantis being just
waves it's hand over me.

498
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,884
And the next thing I
know, I'm having a dream

499
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,469
where I'm chasing butterflies.

500
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,304
>> Oh.

501
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,933
>> So the Mantis being, they've
evolved to the point where

502
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,021
their minds can
manipulate matter.

503
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,856
So let's take this pillow--

504
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,857
>> Levitate.

505
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,859
>> Let's take this pillow
for an example, right?

506
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,237
They have the ability
to make the electrons

507
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:59,075
and atoms in this pillow move
to match their frequency.

508
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,618
And so they can just
move through it.

509
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,663
So it's all-- they're just
masters of the universe.

510
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,665
So they don't even
really need technology.

511
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,291
>> Right.

512
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,044
>> And the work that they do
with the Reptilians is--

513
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,338
like, they need this,
and helping them evolve

514
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,342
and just to observe everything.

515
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,843
>> So did you get
the toothpick out?

516
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,053
>> Yes.

517
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,845
It was out.

518
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,846
It did get out.

519
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,805
That was fine.

520
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,559
But what a weird feeling, having
a hand digging in your stomach.

521
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,644
Oh, weird.

522
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,606
>> Well, for years, people have
been trying to get Robert and I

523
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,565
together--

524
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
>> OK.

525
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,110
>> --you know, over
the phone and that.

526
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,740
And we both had so much
going on at the same time,

527
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,951
we just did not connect.

528
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:48,666
A couple years ago, I
came to this conference.

529
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:52,545
And Robert was here as well.

530
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,381
He was staying in
a separate place.

531
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,467
And I was actually getting
ready to leave the conference.

532
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,762
So all these people
were around us, saying,

533
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,889
you two gotta get together now.

534
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,848
Now's the time.

535
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,018
Now's the time,
which was awesome.

536
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,231
And we came together.

537
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,693
And we were looking
at each other.

538
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,695
And we couldn't even speak.

539
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,031
Our mouths just fell open.

540
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:29,165
And we were just like,
holy cow and knew

541
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:35,046
we are on ships together, have
been, are on ships together,

542
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,926
and that we have this really
close Mantis connection.

543
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,678
And we just really clicked.

544
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:46,307
We spontaneously, when
we were together--

545
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,644
and there were a few
other hybrids around--

546
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,981
we spontaneously did
the Mantis bow together.

547
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,773
And--

548
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,066
>> The Mantis bow?

549
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,609
>> We had never--

550
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,742
there was no way either of
us could have known that.

551
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,785
You know what I'm saying?

552
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,247
We had never-- we just
spontaneously did it.

553
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:15,336
And then we went into speaking
the way we do as Mantis.

554
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,047
And then we just
had so much fun.

555
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:23,094
Everybody was having fun there,
watching and enjoying it.

556
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,474
And so he and I, Robert and I
have been very connected since.

557
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,477
We talk a lot over the
phone and have discussions

558
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,313
that most people
would not understand,

559
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,898
that's Mantis.

560
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:43,156
So we get to share these
wonderful happenings

561
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,491
and frequencies.

562
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:52,207
And that is very special for us.

563
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,377
>> The best way I put it-- it's
like a similar feeling that

564
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:00,965
people can relate to, it's the
same thing as two Americans

565
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,468
living in Russia, for example.

566
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,845
And we don't speak
Russian very well.

567
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,015
And now, of these two
Americans, we meet.

568
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,142
And oh, not only are
we two Americans,

569
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,229
but we're from the same
state or from the same town.

570
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,858
So we have this really, really
unique connection that Russians

571
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,652
wouldn't be able to understand.

572
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,820
This is the exact same
feeling, you know.

573
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,573
>> So you had this greeting.

574
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,408
Was sort of an unconscious bow--

575
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,826
>> It just happened
spontaneously.

576
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,578
>> --greeting that
just happened.

577
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,373
And when you say
language, is it actually

578
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,375
another separate
language language?

579
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,167
It's not English?

580
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,043
>> No.

581
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,628
>> Wow.

582
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,090
And is it-- and you
understand the words?

583
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,927
Or is it more intuitive?

584
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,054
>> It's more of a frequency.

585
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,722
If you think about
it, they don't really

586
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,307
talk in a language.

587
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:55,353
It's more of a frequency.

588
00:30:55,353 --> 00:31:00,567
So it's like a psychic
vibrational connection that you

589
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,985
just-- it's hard to understand--

590
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,820
>> So you're not actually
moving your lips then.

591
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,320
>> Yeah.

592
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,113
>> Oh, you are.

593
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,614
>> Oh, it's out loud, yeah.

594
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,284
Everybody thought
we-- it was fun.

595
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:14,789
>> It's a physical
manifestation of communication.

596
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,457
>> Of the energy.

597
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,003
Because you can't bring
it through in English.

598
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,920
It's a frequency.

599
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,381
And the voice shifts in
all kinds of ways to--

600
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,300
it just comes through.

601
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,926
It's so pure.

602
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,719
And--

603
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,012
>> It's not a learned thing.

604
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,637
It's just--

605
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,597
- It's a natural thing.

606
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,058
>> It's a natural
soul kind of language.

607
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,851
>> Interesting.

608
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,103
>> I've had a being say once--

609
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:43,151
another hybrid, they're just
full on realized, you know?

610
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,195
And they're able to bring
their full ET self in.

611
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:46,988
>> Right.

612
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:53,119
>> They say, everybody uses
the harsh words, you know.

613
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,120
It's hard on our ears.

614
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,705
It hurts our ears.

615
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,082
Why can't they speak
like you speak?

616
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,877
Why can't they
talk like you talk?

617
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,379
When you do the language, it's
like it's just a frequency.

618
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,714
It's a--

619
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,426
>> Harsh words meaning
English being harsh words?

620
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,305
>> Because the vibration of our
language is a third dimensional

621
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:19,646
language, so if you imagine,
it would be like someone who

622
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,858
listens to Mozart now
having death metal played

623
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,193
in their ear.

624
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,111
[LAUGHTER]

625
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,237
>> Yeah, I can see that.

626
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,864
>> That's the
difference, you know.

627
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,034
>> That's very-- the
energy here is very harsh.

628
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:33,826
>> Yeah.

629
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,039
>> OK, yeah, OK.

630
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,001
So speaking of the mission
then, let's get into that.

631
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,505
What is the mission?

632
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,714
Why this contact?

633
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,342
Why the hybridization?

634
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,303
Why-- what's going on?

635
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,015
>> It's really a
multi-dimensional thing, right?

636
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,228
So there's many, many layers
and different aspects to why.

637
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:05,900
One of the reasons
why, for me anyways,

638
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,945
they had to do a little bit
of the tweaking so that way,

639
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,949
my consciousness could
incarnate into this body, right?

640
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,034
Now, that doesn't make me--

641
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,494
in all reality,
it doesn't make me

642
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,747
much different from me and
you because when it happens,

643
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,665
I have the same thing.

644
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,083
I forget.

645
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,793
I don't have any memory of this.

646
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:30,049
So what happens if, like,
you want to understand

647
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,384
what it is to be--

648
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,638
let's see-- an ant,
for an example, right?

649
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,600
Well, you would come and live
the life of an ant, right?

650
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,269
You can't just like--

651
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,604
you can sit there and
study them all you want.

652
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,858
But actually get to understand
it is to incarnate as one.

653
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,692
>> Sure.

654
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,653
>> And it could have
the exact same--

655
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,488
not as superpower ant.

656
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,907
Sure, some things
do bleed through,

657
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,243
like some psychic
things and whatnot.

658
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,747
But as far as me, it's--

659
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,583
I didn't have the
psychicness or any of that.

660
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,751
Well, I'm sure it was there.

661
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,752
I just didn't realize it.

662
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,544
But--

663
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,545
[LAUGHTER]

664
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,381
But you know, to live
a human experience,

665
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:15,470
to go through the
childhood, you know,

666
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,265
and the harshness
of this reality.

667
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,142
So that way, I can
better understand

668
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,313
what it is to be a human
being, just so I can understand

669
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,775
humanity so when they do
come to introduce themselves

670
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,403
to humanity, they
can now figure out

671
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,406
how can I do this without
completely destroying

672
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,824
this civilization.

673
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,202
So now, if you go back
to the ant analogy here,

674
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,121
imagine now you, as a person,
looking at an ant colony,

675
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,372
right?

676
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:49,170
And let's say someone came by
and kicked the ant hill, right?

677
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,965
And now, we're coming
down, looking at it.

678
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,345
I mean, as a person, how do I
make these ants not go crazy?

679
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,097
You can't just take your
finger, and you put your finger

680
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,057
in the ant hill--

681
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,641
>> They'll bite it.

682
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,184
>> They're going to
go crazy, you know?

683
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,894
So you just have to
sit back and observe.

684
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,562
And the only way we can--

685
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:11,734
the only way they can help the
ants now is to go in as an ant

686
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,821
and tell the ants, hey, guys,
don't worry about the big dude

687
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,822
up there.

688
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,864
Don't worry about it.

689
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,907
There's no need to panic.

690
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,991
>> Just rebuild--

691
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,201
>> They're only here to help.

692
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,954
>> Or the big dude up there
just wasn't paying attention

693
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,996
and kicked over the hill.

694
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,455
>> Exactly.

695
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:24,705
>> Right.

696
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,457
So we just gotta
rebuild the hill.

697
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,250
>> Exactly.

698
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,962
And so a lot of us
come down to help

699
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,839
so it's not so frightening.

700
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,507
And I know it's
frightening because I've

701
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,300
been through the fear.

702
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,720
And that was part of my
mission, if you will,

703
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,057
to go through being
ignorant, being--

704
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,310
I mean, I was go, George
Bush, you know, at the time,

705
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,186
and bomb Saddam.

706
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:54,026
And I was, like, ignorant,
just a typical American.

707
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,736
You know, America, woo!

708
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,529
You know?

709
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,363
>> Nice.

710
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,699
>> And then all of a
sudden, it's like I said,

711
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,867
a ET comes around.

712
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,328
And I just-- it scared
the daylights out of me.

713
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,454
And they didn't want--

714
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,289
they didn't like--

715
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,874
>> So you really did.

716
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,125
Most of us sort of have this--

717
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,714
slow, for me, I discovered
spirituality and martial arts,

718
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,842
and you know, kind of
been digesting this stuff.

719
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,512
So you went from George
Bush to Mantis being.

720
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,014
>> Oh, my god, yeah,
a Mantis being.

721
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,515
>> Wow.

722
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,520
And it-- I mean, I believe that
most of the human population is

723
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,276
completely unaware of and
ignorant to the reality of--

724
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,068
>> Reality.

725
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,403
>> Of reality, exactly.

726
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,030
>> What we know reality is.

727
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,822
>> What reality is.

728
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,490
>> Yes.

729
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,702
>> So I ended up becoming
a fractal of what I believe

730
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,494
what's to come.

731
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,121
And that's contact
with the beings.

732
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,998
And so what's going
to happen at first,

733
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,793
when most of the population
just has the truth smack him

734
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,211
in the face--

735
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,088
you know, the same
thing happened to me.

736
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,549
The truth smacked
me in the face.

737
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,968
So now that I have
that experience,

738
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:05,056
I'm able to tell people,
it's OK, it's OK.

739
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,476
You know, I've worked the steps.

740
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,978
I've gone through the
trials and tribulations.

741
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,813
>> In a short amount
of time it sounds like.

742
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,398
>> An extremely
short amount of time.

743
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,316
>> Huh.

744
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,609
Congratulations.

745
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,944
>> Thank you.

746
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,736
>> You're here.

747
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,528
You're alive.

748
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,363
>> I'm alive.

749
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:27,203
And you know, it's
been a nightmare.

750
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,414
I mean, if you want to
get into how it started.

751
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,042
But you know, if you want
to do your mission first.

752
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,920
>> Well, I've been an animal
communicator for 36 years

753
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,713
professionally.

754
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,841
And I've always been
telepathic and psychic.

755
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,470
Earlier on, I had
dreams that came true,

756
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,766
and knew when someone
was going to cross over,

757
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,477
which was not fun
to know sometimes.

758
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,562
>> In the-- with the animals?

759
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,397
Or with people.

760
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,440
>> With humans because I
worked with both people

761
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,610
and the animals psychically.

762
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,240
And so it's been a rough road.

763
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,952
And my abilities
developed earlier on

764
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,038
because I had a near-death
experience at six years old.

765
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,835
So I went into all those realms
and knew it and came back

766
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,627
with that.

767
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:27,805
But in terms of that, it
unfolded for me in that--

768
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,516
I've been through some very
tough stuff in my life,

769
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:35,604
as most of us have, and had
another near-death experience

770
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,397
in my 20s.

771
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:42,320
And that really set me on
my path with all of this.

772
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,284
And so it really kicked
me in super high gear

773
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,869
into using telepathy.

774
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:55,458
I was-- other things were
going on psychically as well.

775
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,003
So I chose to use those energies
to communicate with animals

776
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,923
and to be of service, to give
the animals a voice so people

777
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,384
could understand the animals.

778
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,721
And then I was working
psychically with people

779
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,099
as well, doing psychic
readings for people.

780
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,688
And then when I fully realized
I had the ET frequencies and all

781
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:22,818
of that, then I started
opening and really unfolding.

782
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:28,449
Things started unfolding
for me to get into that.

783
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:33,287
And so I see my mission
as giving the message

784
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:38,542
that we are all one
and helping people

785
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,879
to get in touch
with who they are.

786
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,840
Because the star
readings I do helps

787
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,258
their star families show up.

788
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,719
And I just get them
connected and give messages

789
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,848
and give them tone mantras
to do that really connect.

790
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,600
So I love doing that.

791
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,644
It's great fun.

792
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,188
And also, I'm a certified
hypnotherapist and work

793
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,526
with experiencers to help
them process their experiences

794
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
because I've been
through it all,

795
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,948
I mean, really with positive
experience with beings,

796
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:13,369
not so positive
experiences with beings.

797
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:18,499
And I certainly understand the
human experience pretty much

798
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,709
from A to Z, I can say.

799
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,336
>> It's a pretty wide spectrum.

800
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,131
>> It's been an
interesting life.

801
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:29,260
And I'm glad I'm at where I
am at and so grateful to be

802
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,846
here and have many miracles.

803
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,932
I mean, I have had two NDEs.

804
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,854
And another time, I almost
died about 11 years ago.

805
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,939
So it's been quite a walk.

806
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,733
>> Is that from an actual
physical event and then--

807
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,734
>> Yeah, just some--

808
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,527
yeah.

809
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,445
>> OK.

810
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,616
>> So I've had a lot of
miracles in order to stay here

811
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,870
and continue sharing.

812
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,708
I love sharing with people
and talking about all of this

813
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,668
and about star
beings and sharing

814
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,130
about the different
kinds of cultures

815
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,885
of star beings and their
languages and symbols.

816
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,679
And so I'm doing
a lot of that now,

817
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,764
light language and
symbols with people.

818
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:20,519
And that's-- I can't think of
anything to do that would be

819
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,062
more fun.

820
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:22,897
>> Wow.

821
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:27,318
Well, getting back to your guys'
interactions.

822
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,197
Do you have actual memories
of being on the ships that you

823
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,866
might be able to share and
what those experiences--

824
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,076
and what entailed--

825
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,871
what's going on,
or what happened.

826
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,248
>> Oh my.

827
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,583
>> If you want to.

828
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,668
>> I do, but I'm trying to think
of which one would be--

829
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,463
I'll give you two, two experiences

830
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:51,759
that I would say are my most
profound experiences ever.

831
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,845
And I drew pictures of it.

832
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,474
To recreate my experience,
I'll let you check them out.

833
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,226
>> Oh, please.

834
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:05,856
>> The one-- one of my most
memorable was when I have

835
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,068
an experience, I call it--

836
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,903
I come into
consciousness or become

837
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,655
aware of that I'm
having the experience,

838
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,866
'cause you go to bed,
and next thing you know,

839
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,619
you're having an experience.

840
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,663
So all of a sudden--

841
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,580
>> Like a lucid dream.

842
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,373
>> Exactly.

843
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,626
But it's not-- it's not a dream.

844
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,795
I can tell the difference
between a dream

845
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,923
and an experience
because there's touch.

846
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,716
There's texture.

847
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,926
There's smell.

848
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,469
There's taste, you know.

849
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,681
It's just like-- you know,
in dreams, you don't get--

850
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,975
we don't get this, you know?

851
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,144
So I'm able to
tell the difference

852
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,064
between an actual
experience and a dream.

853
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:53,195
And in this particular
one, I came into awareness.

854
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:57,992
And I remember--
how do I start this?

855
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,369
Because it's so
multidimensional.

856
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,583
I remember being able to
see 360 degrees around me.

857
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,001
I was smaller.

858
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,713
I was probably about the
size of a tennis ball.

859
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,674
And I was inside--

860
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,134
I remember seeing--

861
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,553
here's my perspective.

862
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:22,433
I'm seeing hands like this and
a being's face staring at me.

863
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,393
And then I look around.

864
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,103
I can see around the being.

865
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:31,650
And my body is in a chair
like this, slumped over.

866
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,320
The top of my head was removed.

867
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,323
And you could see my
brain with all the veins,

868
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,535
and all the layers of--

869
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,995
the film layers.

870
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,790
And there's three beings
there rubbing their hands

871
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,043
through my brain.

872
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,881
And so what I realized
was what I was, they

873
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,884
pulled my consciousness
out of my body,

874
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,511
and was holding my consciousness
in my hand, which we all

875
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:04,600
are just this little
spark of divine creation.

876
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,976
>> This is the 21 grams.

877
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,562
>> Yeah.

878
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,521
That's exactly it.

879
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,024
And there's no-- when you're
in that state of consciousness,

880
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:20,407
when you're pulled out from
your body, there's no fear.

881
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,868
There's just curiosity.

882
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,036
I remember thinking, wait.

883
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:24,953
Where am I?

884
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,746
Wait.

885
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,705
Is that me?

886
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,207
Yeah, that's me.

887
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,666
And then the being
goes-- the being

888
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,835
realized that I became aware.

889
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,380
And it goes, oh,
oh, oh, hey there.

890
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,966
Hey, why is a
giraffe's neck so long?

891
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,343
And I said, I don't know.

892
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,803
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

893
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,388
And it says, because
of its vertebrae.

894
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,348
[IMITATES LAUGH]

895
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,559
And I remember just
cracking up, right?

896
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,020
And I mean, I
remember thinking, I

897
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,730
can't believe that
this being just

898
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,649
made an attempt at this joke.

899
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,652
That's a terrible joke,
but it's hilarious.

900
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,611
And my body--

901
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,782
I'm looking around, and
my body goes... [SLOW LAUGH]

902
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,616
>> Wow.

903
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,867
That's got to be so crazy.

904
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,660
>> Human joke.

905
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,869
>> Tell me about it, right?

906
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,497
[LAUGHTER]

907
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,582
You know, it just
melted my brain.

908
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,000
And this is before--

909
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,880
this is when my experiences
were starting, so at that time,

910
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,840
I wasn't quite really--

911
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,633
I was just, like, coming
in, like-- so when

912
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,094
I woke up the next--
all of a sudden, black.

913
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,972
And I woke up, feel
like I hit by a train.

914
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,057
There's no marks on my head.

915
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:27,850
>> Right.

916
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,227
And did you ever get what
they were doing to your brain?

917
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,395
>> A little later, yeah.

918
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,273
But at that time, I had no idea.

919
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,566
It freaked me out.

920
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,778
And I was like, waking up back
in my body, back in my self,

921
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,990
going what the was that?

922
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,451
That's like saying,
what the was that?

923
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,537
You know, it scared
the crap out of me

924
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:52,458
because I was getting
sick at that time.

925
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,710
At the beginning of my
experience, I was 210 pounds.

926
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,297
Went to 120 pounds.

927
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
And the doctor said I was dying.

928
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,676
And they didn't know why.

929
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,471
So at that time, I
was thinking, oh god,

930
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,555
what are they doing to me?

931
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,431
They're killing me.

932
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,432
And this is bad.

933
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,725
That wasn't the case.

934
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,898
So you know, I wake
up the next day.

935
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,691
And I'm just freaking out.

936
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,361
I had to go to work at 6 o'clock
in the morning at a hardware

937
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,321
store that I worked at.

938
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,239
And I can't call in
sick and say, hey

939
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,034
I was abducted by
aliens last night.

940
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,995
Can I not come in to work today?

941
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,581
Yeah, so that was
my most profound--

942
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,373
>> Yeah, that's--

943
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,166
>> --experiences.

944
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,419
I found out later they were
just repairing the damage that

945
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:41,548
was done to my brain through
being diagnosed with ADD

946
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,717
and having the
anti-depressants my whole life.

947
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,969
And they were just repairing
the damage that was--

948
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,513
>> Wow, they're repairing
the pharmaceutical damage.

949
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:47,888
>> Correct.

950
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,597
Yeah.

951
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,139
>> Interesting.

952
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,183
>> And I had a similar
experience where they went

953
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:56,438
into my brain as well to
recalibrate, they told me,

954
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:02,694
that they had to reset, and 
recalibrate some things

955
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,990
after something I had gone
through physically, with hitting

956
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,950
my head.

957
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,872
And so it's a really--
and I was awake.

958
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,707
I mean, I was very aware of it.

959
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:19,461
It's such a weird feeling
because I could see my brain.

960
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,507
And I knew what they
were doing, so I was OK.

961
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,760
But they had their
hands in my brain

962
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,054
and just shifting
some things around.

963
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:36,019
And they said, it's all OK.

964
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,691
And I really trusted that.

965
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,862
And they actually
levitated me above my bed

966
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:50,117
several times when I was
still getting into all this.

967
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:54,454
Because they came one
night to recalibrate me.

968
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,124
And I was like not as OK.

969
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,792
I mean, we've all
been through our fear.

970
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,421
Even though we're hybrids and
that, we're like anybody else.

971
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,630
We've been through our stuff.

972
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,718
And so they showed
up in my room.

973
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,095
And I was in bed.

974
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:14,182
And I started running
for the door, thinking--

975
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,560
I couldn't open the door.

976
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,519
I couldn't.

977
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,690
And they levitated me, like,
five feet up over my bed.

978
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,693
And I'm just, like,
being levitated.

979
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:30,490
And they said, do you think
you can calm down now?

980
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,660
And I just was on
the bed, paralyzed.

981
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,120
And then I was gone.

982
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,290
So the next night,
they came again.

983
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,543
And I got up to run again.

984
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:46,590
And they said, are we going
to go through this again?

985
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,508
And I went, no.

986
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,595
And I turned around and
went back into the bed.

987
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,349
And then I was just gone again.

988
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,435
But we've had to work
through our fear of it.

989
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,438
Oh, my gosh, I was
being levitated.

990
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,481
Are you kidding me?

991
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,607
>> Yeah, that's terrifying.

992
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,359
>> I was terrified.

993
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,989
And they said, this is what
we're going to say to you.

994
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:17,704
If a parent's child has
had something go wrong

995
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:25,462
and they need to be taken to the
hospital to be administered to,

996
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,632
and the child's kicking
and screaming, saying,

997
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,844
I don't want to go, but
what is the parent going

998
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,805
to do in the end?

999
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,766
We're going to take the
child to the hospital.

1000
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:42,396
And they said, that's basically
what we need to do with you

1001
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,939
and to get some things--

1002
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:49,861
your frequencies
recalibrated in your brain.

1003
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,031
And so they reset me.

1004
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:58,036
And that made me feel better.

1005
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:03,291
And I knew they were loving,
compassionate, and kind.

1006
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:08,880
It's that human response,
even if you don't want to.

1007
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,970
But after that, I have no
trouble with experiences now.

1008
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,347
I'm just like, hey--

1009
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,348
>> Love the experience.

1010
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:18,932
>> Good to see you.

1011
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:19,808
>> And experiencing--

1012
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:20,642
>> Let's go.

1013
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,560
>> I crave them, yeah.

1014
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,061
>> I'm ready to visit the ship.

1015
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,439
Let's go.

1016
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,776
But we all go through
our fear experiences

1017
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,404
too before we fully
know who we are.

1018
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,532
>> The thing is, as a human,
we experience the traumas of--

1019
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,366
>> Oh, just--

1020
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,869
>> Oh, my god, just this crazy--

1021
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,579
Everyone I know is--

1022
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,665
I think all of
humanity has PTSD.

1023
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,083
>> Yeah, I mean, seriously.

1024
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,127
I did.

1025
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,755
>> And now we're getting PTSD
from the drugs we're taking

1026
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,548
for the PTSD.

1027
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,340
>> Exactly.

1028
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,133
>> Yes.

1029
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:59,181
>> Yeah, but it took me a
while to process all of that.

1030
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,100
I mean, the next
day I was like--

1031
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,893
you know.

1032
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,146
But it's all a matter
of perspective.

1033
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:12,110
I really want to say this,
is that some people might

1034
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,530
be freaked out the rest of
their life from that, saying

1035
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,240
they're evil.

1036
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,576
They levitated me.

1037
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,536
They paralyzed me.

1038
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,412
They took me.

1039
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,081
Who knows what they did to me?

1040
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,918
That could be one
perspective of the victim.

1041
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,046
And I don't choose
to be a victim.

1042
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,380
I'm a part of this.

1043
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,718
My soul volunteered to do this.

1044
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:45,018
And so once I got a handle and
could get beyond the fear--

1045
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,896
and I know I experienced
that so I can understand

1046
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:52,859
when I work with experiencers
that deep fear of going

1047
00:51:52,859 --> 00:52:00,117
like, holy crap, what is
going on, and being taken.

1048
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:06,832
So it truly is, with everything,
a matter of perspective.

1049
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,208
>> It truly is.

1050
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,044
>> That I'm an experiencer.

1051
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,339
I'm not an abductee.

1052
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,173
>> Right.

1053
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,342
>> Which there's
a night and day,

1054
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,261
a difference of even saying it.

1055
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,137
>> Sure.

1056
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,556
>> I had to-- that's one of
the major things that I had go

1057
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,268
through was that I had the
perspective of these guys were

1058
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,727
evil and taking over.

1059
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,728
Oh, my god.

1060
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,106
I went up for my first
craft, I thought, this is it.

1061
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,440
This is doomsday.

1062
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,901
The ships are here to
take us and everything.

1063
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,070
And my first craft
that I ever saw--

1064
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,072
I got a picture of that
craft I'm talking about.

1065
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,282
>> OK.

1066
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,743
>> It was, like, a 45-minute
encounter with a ship.

1067
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,913
And I remember
thinking, oh my gosh.

1068
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,956
I'm a good person.

1069
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,332
I'm a benevolent being.

1070
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,208
I'm friendly.

1071
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,001
Don't hurt me.

1072
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:51,877
Don't hurt me.

1073
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:57,340
Even my wife-- imagine
a black triangle,

1074
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,259
almost half the size
of a football field,

1075
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,053
with, like, black
holes up inside

1076
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,307
of it oozing out blue plasma.

1077
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,850
If it's a--

1078
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,436
>> And so your wife has been--

1079
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,062
>> She's been experiencing--

1080
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,315
>> --experiencing
things along with you.

1081
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,860
I guess if you're hanging
out with a Mantis,

1082
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,070
you're gonna get something.

1083
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,238
>> Yeah, definitely.

1084
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:25,160
>> The interesting thing is
that with me and my wife,

1085
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,497
they didn't start waking us both
up until we both got together.

1086
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,334
So it's almost like they waited
until we had that support.

1087
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,712
Because without her, I wouldn't
be here talking to you.

1088
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,840
I wouldn't have survived
my tribulation period,

1089
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,133
as I like to call it.

1090
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,052
There's no way in heck
I would've survived it.

1091
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,264
So they kind of waited for
me to have the support.

1092
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,934
>> And then in turn, is she
having her own individual

1093
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,060
experiences as well?

1094
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,061
>> Oh, yes, she is.

1095
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,604
Yes.

1096
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,480
And it's amazing.

1097
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,149
But I'm lucky that
I get to share it

1098
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,984
with somebody, so lucky.

1099
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:01,154
>> Great. I just wanna 
change this battery right quick.

1100
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,113
>> Sure.

1101
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,657
>> and we will go 
ahead and close up.

1102
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,409
>> I can go a little longer if you want to?

1103
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,411
>> OK, yeah.

1104
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:13,083
>> I get so emotional about all this.

1105
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,213
>> I know, I know.
