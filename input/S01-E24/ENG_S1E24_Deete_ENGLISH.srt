1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:10,719
What motivates relating?
What motivates that ability

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,554
to relate to another person?

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,768
that is sort of this desire to 'see'

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,395
and to be seen.

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,232
open up and have a sense of that openness

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,317
so that others can see you.

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,696
And you are open to

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,698
seeing them. It's like this intimacy.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,951
I use the word 'see' because

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,163
when we are seeking to relate 

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:43,168
we're really going back down
to basics of our five senses.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,669
What am I seeing? 

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,465
What am I perceiving 
with my eyes? 

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,093
Intuitively we might feel 
something.

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,263
We might feel something different 
than what our eyes are seeing.

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,643
But because our intuitive 
body is picking up something.

17
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,814
That doesn't necessarily mean
it's true for the other person.

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,403
In this relatability we're 
focussing on what we're

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,031
physically observing.

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,786
So there is an inner knowing

21
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,288
that needs to be paid
attention to,

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,751
an acknowledgment of 
what is in feeling,

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,798
and our society often will 

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,803
talk about these boundaries 

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,597
and I think those are important,

26
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,017
but I think those boundaries 
can also be readdressed 

27
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,645
with how we intuitively 
 feel in the moment.

28
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,731
Sometimes intuitively you will be 
like this is a bad situation

29
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,732
I'm outta here,

30
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,276
I'm getting completely latched 
onto and drained,

31
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,320
and I've had that before,

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,657
it's definitely a different feeling

33
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,701
to have to be emotionally
 in tune with yourself.

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,251
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,669
life elsewhere in the universe?

36
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,548
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

37
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,883
My name is Reuben Langdon.

38
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,263
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

39
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,392
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

40
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,893
Coincidentally, I was working on

41
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,145
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

42
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,482
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

43
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,443
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,155
...are they here with us?

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,662
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,497
...what is their purpose?

47
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,208
Why don't they make themselves more known?

48
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,419
Why the secrecy?

49
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,671
I've asked these questions to many experts,

50
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,340
yet each seems to have a different theory.

51
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,801
So I thought to myself, 

52
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,387
why not ask the aliens directly?

53
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,431
So that's what I set out to do!

54
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,807
Well, sort of...

55
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,276
>> All right.

56
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,153
Deete.

57
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,404
Thank you for having me here.

58
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,950
I wanted to find out a
little bit about yourself

59
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,037
and your process, and
your journey, and--

60
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,871
>> All that jazz.

61
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,456
>> --all that jazz.

62
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,833
Where do you want to start, or where
would you like to start?

63
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,626
>> All right.

64
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,295
So I grew up Mormon
since day one.

65
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,755
Born in Salt Lake City.

66
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,924
We did move to Phoenix,
so I didn't grow up

67
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,676
in Salt Lake City.

68
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,428
But growing up with
that religious mindset,

69
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,931
that was a big program that
I had to break free from.

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,394
And I think part of the
reason that my journey started

71
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,729
was two things that
was the catalyst, which

72
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,942
was my grandma passing
away and, prior to that,

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,237
I was sort of feeling like I
had had enough of this life

74
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,488
and was ready to kill myself.

75
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,281
>> Oh, wow.

76
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,450
>> Yeah, I didn't know how
to break out of the religion

77
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,576
and the mindsets.

78
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,330
And I felt like the only escape
would have been to kill myself.

79
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,541
And then shortly after,
my grandma passed.

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,627
And I started getting
like visitations from her.

81
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,630
And in the Mormon community,
and I think as well

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,300
as other religious
communities, if you

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,719
have a visitation from a
grandma, it's not so weird.

84
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,929
My grandma passed, and I
felt like she was around me.

85
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,556
It wasn't like an odd thing.

86
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,683
>> OK.

87
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,437
>> And so that really helped me
learn to communicate with her.

88
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,231
And then I started having
other beings come to me.

89
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,108
And then it was ET beings.

90
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,694
And that's when things, I think,
got kind of weird for people.

91
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,281
Like, oh, we're having
other-dimensional

92
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,699
communication.

93
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,204
>> So at the time were
you still hardcore Mormon?

94
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,665
>> I was transitioning
out by that point, yeah.

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,878
>> And members of your community
accepted the grandmother

96
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,670
visitations?

97
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,588
>> Yeah.

98
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,422
Yeah.

99
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,259
>> But then going beyond that,
is that when things got weird?

100
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,971
>> That's when I wasn't sure
how much I should give out

101
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,764
to people.

102
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,808
Like, when their passed
grandmothers were coming to me,

103
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,226
or even if their
mother had passed

104
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,438
and they were
giving me messages,

105
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,899
I felt like it was too
much for me to say,

106
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,193
hey, I can hear your
grandma as well.

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,903
This is what she's saying.

108
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,072
But if I get the message
from my own grandma,

109
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,531
it wasn't so weird.

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,616
>> I see.

111
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:11,037
So people-- because I guess
some may feel a little intrusive

112
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,830
then if they were
given those messages?

113
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,331
>> Yeah.

114
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,416
And maybe they feel like,
well that's my grandma.

115
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,627
She should be
communicating with me only.

116
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,253
>> Oh, I see.

117
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,756
>> And then that's the funny
thing that I learned with being

118
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,801
a channeler and a medium,
is when you open yourself up

119
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,971
to, any spirit can communicate
with you and give messages

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,182
of healing, if they feel
like you're going to listen.

121
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,686
And other people close
themselves off to it sometimes.

122
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,898
>> Well, don't you have
to get permission from--

123
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
or you get permission
from their family members,

124
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,276
from the other side?

125
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,111
How does that work?

126
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,533
>> The other side really
doesn't care too much.

127
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,285
>> They're just like, hey,
someone here can understand me.

128
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,123
Let me communicate
to you, for example,

129
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,332
to convey that message.

130
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,125
>> Yeah.

131
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,877
>> And I guess
when other people--

132
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:04,966
I was going to ask, is when
some of the information coming

133
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,137
through is spot on or
accurate, does that sort of

134
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,763
freak them out a little bit?

135
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,683
>> Yeah, that's when they're
they come up with the logical

136
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,475
excuses.

137
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,270
Well, you probably know
that because of this,

138
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,354
or things like that.

139
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,276
I think it does make them a
little like, how would she

140
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,110
know that?

141
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,153
That's nerve wracking.

142
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,989
So my logical mind will step
in and try to make sense of it.

143
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,240
>> Right, right.

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,119
Yeah, I've done that
a long time ago.

145
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,497
That was-- part of
the series was getting

146
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:41,210
to see-- proving for myself
whether all of this other side

147
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,880
stuff is real or not, or
if it's just, you know,

148
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,008
are all these people just
going on the internet

149
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,510
and finding things out about
me, and then conveying it?

150
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,845
But then I'm like, no.

151
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,471
That's not what's happening.

152
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,346
>> You're like, I don't know.

153
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,640
Yeah, I think that's why
spirit just doesn't care,

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,435
is because they
connect to the heart.

155
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,062
And they know that even if
the logical mind steps in,

156
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,440
that heart space can eventually
come through and be like,

157
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,232
you know what?

158
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,942
I feel like this is real.

159
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,944
>> So you start
channeling ETs,

160
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:11,282
or thought communication, I guess.

161
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,950
What was your
first communication

162
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,077
from the ET realm, or that?

163
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,080
>> So I would set a daily
practice of meditation aside.

164
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,875
And that's when I started
channeling other beings

165
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,751
and things like that.

166
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,712
Or I guess spirit beings
that I knew as people.

167
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,297
And then that's when
I started getting

168
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,341
visuals of other beings.

169
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,801
I had a Reptilian that
came that I didn't even

170
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,179
know anything about Reptilians
or anything at that point.

171
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,431
And it kind of was
like, that was weird.

172
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,018
Did my imagination create
a giant lizard guy?

173
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020
I don't know, it
was just a weird--

174
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,064
and then I just saw
things that I didn't think

175
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,233
that I could create in my mind.

176
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,527
Like the Lyran beings--

177
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,445
cats and things.

178
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,989
And I decided to look
it up on the internet,

179
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,700
and there were other people that
had had similar experiences,

180
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,702
or had visions of the
same type of being.

181
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,997
So I'm like, maybe
this is a real contact.

182
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,584
And that's when I opened myself
up more, and I got more of it.

183
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,879
>> So the first being
was a Reptilian.

184
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,047
What did he say?

185
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,591
>> Well, he had-- it was
interesting because he had this

186
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,676
cape on.

187
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:16,097
And it looked like he could
have put a hood kind of thing.

188
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,058
And so I was meditating,
and he came through.

189
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,394
And I was kind of like, whoa.

190
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,188
And then he faded away,
and then a Gray came in.

191
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,190
So I don't know if he
shapeshifted to make it

192
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,192
more something that I felt--

193
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,777
>> Like, "I'm an
alien" kind of thing?

194
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,903
>> Yeah, I'm just an alien.

195
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,364
Yeah.

196
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,450
But he's told me that he's
my guide and protector.

197
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,869
And so he's kind of
always been there.

198
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:43,249
But initially it was
a weird thing for me.

199
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,166
And then I got--

200
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,126
>> Does he have a name?

201
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:45,876
>> Does have a name?

202
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,711
>> Yeah.

203
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,672
>> As far as I can
hear, he calls himself--

204
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:55,344
he says "Balthazar,"
is how he says it.

205
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,388
>> Do you know what
realm of Reptilians?

206
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,265
Because there's so many.

207
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,268
>> Well, he says he's
with the Alpha Draconis.

208
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,771
But he often works
with the Council

209
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,609
of Beings, which can be Pleiade
or from all over, basically,

210
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,901
to help humanity.

211
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,069
>> OK.

212
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,654
So for those who
are watching, there

213
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,241
are Alpha Draconians
that are actually helping,

214
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,285
as opposed to being all--

215
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,788
because a common
misconception, I

216
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,542
guess, would be that all
the Reptilians are bad.

217
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,295
A lot of people who
subscribe to this information

218
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,921
are like, oh,
Reptilian, stay back.

219
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,714
>> Yeah.

220
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,425
And with that, I'll Alpha
Draconis is mainly just a star

221
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,217
system.

222
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,844
So it's like
Pleiades star system.

223
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,721
And you're going to
have benevolent beings,

224
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,848
and you're going to have
those that are in favor

225
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,141
of humanity's evolution.

226
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,226
And that's the same
with the Draconis.

227
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,354
They have a lot
of evolved beings

228
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,814
that are in service
of humanity now,

229
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,233
even though maybe at one
point they hadn't been.

230
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,903
And there are still those
break-offs in that star system

231
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,988
that are heavily domineering.

232
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,742
And then there's
also the species

233
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:04,330
that stay within Earth that
are lower realms of Reptilian

234
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,499
that I would say are
more of the dangerous

235
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,459
because they're not evolved.

236
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,797
And they wish to stay
in Fourth Density.

237
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,759
>> So all this information
that you just described,

238
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,929
this is all just coming through
these different interactions

239
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,305
with these different beings?

240
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,557
>> Yeah, or just through
channelings that I've done

241
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,477
for individuals and,
I guess, more public.

242
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,269
>> Yeah.

243
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,481
Well, when I first
discovered your work,

244
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,484
I was blown away
on how correlating

245
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,821
it was with all the other
stuff I've been doing,

246
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,905
interviewing others.

247
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,783
And you haven't been doing
this that long, right?

248
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,077
It's only been this
past year or two?

249
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,245
>> Maybe a year and a half.

250
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,037
>> A year and a half.
>> Maybe, yeah.

251
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,830
>> Wow.

252
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,128
And I was blown away by
the in-depthness of some

253
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,004
of the channelings and
the information coming

254
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,800
through that, again,
just correlates

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,177
with everything I've been
studying for the past 10 years.

256
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,887
>> Good, I'm glad
I'm not way off.

257
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,721
>> No, no.

258
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:07,226
You're right on track,
which is why I'm here,

259
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,894
and we're doing this.

260
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,648
So after the
Reptilian encounter,

261
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:17,570
shapeshifting into a Gray,
what other sort of beings

262
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,029
came through?

263
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,785
>> There was a Gray and a Mantis
that came through after I was

264
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,663
resisting a while on
my path and things.

265
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:32,293
And I don't know if the Gray
was the Reptilian in disguise.

266
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,627
I don't know.

267
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,257
There was a lot of language that
sounded like ancient Egyptian,

268
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,051
and spoke of like
choosing me to be

269
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,388
the channeler for information,
and things like that.

270
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,974
And so that's when
I basically started

271
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,185
taking things more seriously.

272
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:55,274
And there was another very vivid
contact where I was actually

273
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,108
on the couch here.

274
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,401
I had fallen asleep one night.

275
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,738
And a Draconis being came.

276
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,948
And he looked like a giant bat.

277
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,117
It was so intense.

278
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,243
He had the wings.

279
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,244
It was dark.

280
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,791
And I had-- it felt like
a lower dimensional being

281
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,751
standing to the side of me.

282
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,170
I couldn't get a glimpse
of what it looked like.

283
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,215
But it was cursing me out.

284
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,926
And the Draconis
was like, basically,

285
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,303
surrender to your path.

286
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,889
Let go of the old ideas,
because at the time

287
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,143
I was having a hard
time transitioning.

288
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,771
But he did it in such a--

289
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,523
I don't want to say
dark way, because it

290
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
benefited me to understand
that I need to get serious.

291
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,110
But it was dark energy.

292
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,987
It was just a very intense--

293
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,739
I mean, he was basically like--

294
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,991
the way he stood, his
presence, everything

295
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,160
was just very interesting.

296
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,245
>> This was the bat being?

297
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:49,828
The bat?

298
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,663
>> Yeah.

299
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,331
>> But you said there was
another lower being at the same

300
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
time that was yelling at you?

301
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,000
>> Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,086
>> And he was yelling
at you as well?

303
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:57,920
>> No.

304
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,380
The bat being--

305
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,882
I actually woke up
and was like, why

306
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,342
is there a bat man in my room?

307
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,095
Because it felt so-- or not
in my room, but next to me,

308
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,806
because it felt so
much like a bat man.

309
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,391
>> Right.

310
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,726
>> But then the lower
dimensional being was the one

311
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,478
that's cursing me out.

312
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,271
The other one--

313
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,730
>> So the other
one was just there.

314
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,775
>> He was there, and he
basically communicated

315
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,777
in a very dignified way.

316
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,488
But it was a very powerful way.

317
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,407
Like, to the point where
you'd want to listen.

318
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,911
But everything just
felt very intense.

319
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,830
>> Have you made
sense of that since?

320
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,915
Why the two beings--

321
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
two different beings,
and at the same time.

322
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,294
One is doing the-- you know.

323
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,504
>> Basically, from
what I understand--

324
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,172
I don't know if this is 100%.

325
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,343
But because my vibration had
to rise so much to communicate

326
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,554
to this other Draconis being--

327
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
because I could almost see him.

328
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,268
There was no third
dimension, where I was at.

329
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,604
I had to slip through
the fourth dimension.

330
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,732
And so I was able to interact
with fourth-dimensional beings

331
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,986
that were trying to, I guess,
take me down or communicate

332
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,529
negative emotions to me,

333
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,864
things like that.

334
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,199
>> So when you open
yourself up as a channel,

335
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,077
then it can be
negative, positive?

336
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,747
Everybody's trying to
get to you in a way.

337
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,789
>> Yeah.

338
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,834
>> To communicate
through, or to--

339
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,878
what do you think
the purposes are?

340
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:26,342
>> I don't think they like when
there's light being brought

341
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,217
into the soul.

342
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,011
I feel like there's
a lot of emotions

343
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,889
that they can gain when
things stay in low dimensions.

344
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,515
Low density.

345
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,019
And during the time when
I was starting channeling,

346
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,565
I didn't know how to block
myself, or how to set the tone,

347
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,358
I guess.

348
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,484
My intention.

349
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,904
And I got a lot of low
dimensions coming in.

350
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,822
And I just don't
think they like it.

351
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,033
I don't think they like
you shedding light and love

352
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,827
to people and letting
them know their power.

353
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,413
>> And I guess if you are
going to, and they can see you

354
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:00,751
as being a conduit, then, well,
maybe they can use that energy.

355
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,253
Or use you as the conduit
for their energy instead.

356
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,088
>> Yeah.

357
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,801
>> So having both
channelings of--

358
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,639
I try to guide more to the
positive, and empowering

359
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,431
messages.

360
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,684
But I guess in
the same sense you

361
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,770
can have people
channeling the bad stuff.

362
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,606
Negative energy and
disempowering information.

363
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,401
>> Well, and it's kind of like
where our world is at today.

364
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,404
There's a lot of powerful people
that know ancient knowledge.

365
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,155
They know about those things.

366
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,908
And instead of using it for
good, they've used it for evil.

367
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,577
So it's like if I
can tap into that,

368
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,706
can they get me to use
it for evil purposes

369
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,042
or whatever the case is, like
they've always been able to do?

370
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,795
Or can we transmute
that and use it

371
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,048
for collective of
humanity's evolution?

372
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,841
>> Right, right.

373
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,302
When did you go public
with all of this?

374
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:56,890
When did you decide
to share this gift?

375
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,891
>> Share the gift!

376
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:03,647
So I woke up one morning, and
I had this burning sensation--

377
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,901
yearning or whatever-- to
channel Princess Diana publicly

378
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,945
and post it on YouTube.

379
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,364
And it was just something
that I just knew I had to do.

380
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,782
>> Was she already
coming through?

381
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,244
>> She had been coming through.

382
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,038
Not quite like I
did on the video.

383
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,623
That was pretty
long and intense.

384
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,416
So.

385
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,751
>> I don't think I saw that one.

386
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,461
Can you just give
us a little sneak?

387
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,545
>> It was very emotional.

388
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,172
It was the first time
I ever really did

389
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,425
a long period of channeling.

390
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,303
And she basically got
into some deep issues.

391
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,514
And yeah, that's basically
how I started on the YouTube

392
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,391
and decided whoever
comes, I will

393
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,226
channel you and make it public.

394
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,353
And that's kind of how it went.

395
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:47,566
>> And what was the reaction
when you put that up?

396
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,525
How did people respond?

397
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
>> Actually, fairly well.

398
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,528
People really enjoyed it.

399
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,156
>> And then that propelled
you to keep doing this?

400
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:54,948
>> Yeah.

401
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,493
And then I started
getting more and more

402
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,870
people's deceased loved
ones coming to me.

403
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,123
And that's when I decided to do
private channelings on my own.

404
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,542
And so it just kind of
took off from there.

405
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,461
>> OK.

406
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,464
Being in Salt Lake and
in this energy, what's--

407
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,426
because you mentioned
earlier people

408
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,178
were OK with the
grandmother stuff.

409
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,263
But beyond your
personal grandmother,

410
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,476
when you started going to other
grandmothers or other spirits,

411
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,187
have you gotten much of a
blowback from the community?

412
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,857
>> So I am not very verbal
with all of that now.

413
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,901
I just feel like if
people are ready,

414
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,987
Spirit will help them find
me through the internet

415
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,156
or whatever that way.

416
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,534
I've just had too many
just put up walls,

417
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,911
and they just don't know
how to deal with it.

418
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,039
I do find that women that
have their children out

419
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,292
of the house, and they're
trying to rediscover themselves,

420
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,169
they are starting
to dabble with this,

421
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,754
even if they are in
the Mormon church.

422
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,591
So a lot of my clients that
I have had from Salt Lake

423
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,510
are older women.

424
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,512
>> When you say children
out of the house, like,

425
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,721
grown up and out?

426
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,597
>> Yeah.
>> Is that what you mean?

427
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,431
>> Yeah.

428
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,351
And they kind of are just like,
I've gone to church for years.

429
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,853
Had the same lessons
over and over.

430
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,645
What else is there?

431
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,896
The kids are out of the house.

432
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,232
So they'll start to
explore these things,

433
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,608
and they're more open to it.

434
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,695
And it's the ones that are
having their little kids,

435
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,531
their kids that they're trying
to get into church zone.

436
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,284
And there's still
a little bit unsure

437
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,787
what to bring into their family
life, and even themselves.

438
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,580
>> Right, right.

439
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,210
And probably being conditioned
since birth, right?

440
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,671
So they're probably
still a little

441
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,173
scared to go outside
of what they know.

442
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,967
>> Yeah.

443
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,052
>> So, well, hopefully
that'll be changing.

444
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:39,887
It seems like it is.

445
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,598
>> Yes, I'm really hoping.

446
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,851
>> I've done a little research
on the Mormon religion.

447
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,354
But for those who
aren't too familiar,

448
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm guessing it's a pretty
rigid set of rules in it's belief

449
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,903
system?

450
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,695
>> Yeah.

451
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,071
I mean, it's not
just a religion.

452
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,116
It's like you change your
whole life and culture,

453
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,993
almost like Islamic.

454
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,039
You change everything about
how you live, your interactions

455
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,498
with people--

456
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,626
>> In what ways
could you go into?

457
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,712
>> Well, so you don't drink.

458
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
There are a lot of
regulations with--

459
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,136
I guess just how
you live your life.

460
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,680
>> Well, not drinking, that
could be a positive thing.

461
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,058
>> It is a positive thing,
yeah, because it can--

462
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,934
it's fun.

463
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,894
It's really fun to drink
every once in a while.

464
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,438
But it can bring your
vibration to a low state.

465
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,856
And you can't
think very clearly.

466
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,691
So there's something to that.

467
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,611
>> I was recently in
Kuwait, and it's illegal--

468
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,654
alcohol is illegal there.

469
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,321
>> Oh, really?

470
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,781
>> Yeah, they don't
have it at all.

471
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,993
So I thought, oh, that's
actually good to know.

472
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,328
There's nothing wrong with that.

473
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,120
>> Yeah.

474
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,831
The thing is, though, I
think with kids being told,

475
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,416
like, we don't do that.

476
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,334
It's a rule.

477
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,336
Then they get more
intrigued, and then they

478
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,712
take it to a whole other level.

479
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,547
>> Yeah.

480
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,383
Overcompensation
because of the--

481
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,175
>> Yeah.

482
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,009
>> --suppression.

483
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,260
>> I think sexual--

484
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,762
one thing when you
said suppression,

485
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,975
I think the sexual side of
how we are in our culture

486
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,436
is also another lifestyle
that is unhealthy.

487
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,815
And just the way that we live.

488
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,691
>> And is that--

489
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:20,028
because I know the multiple
wives thing, that's sort of--

490
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:20,988
how does that work?

491
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,907
>> So that is a break-off
from the Mormon church.

492
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,951
So we were--

493
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,412
I say we because I've been
a part of it for so long.

494
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,539
But I don't go to
the church anymore.

495
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,708
But the Mormon church
was polygamist.

496
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,334
The government was
getting at them.

497
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,669
And so they said, OK, we're not.

498
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,796
But another side said,
well, we still want to be.

499
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,007
So they broke off,
and they still do.

500
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:44,636
And they call the FLDS,
or a fundamentalist.

501
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,014
>> OK, so there's different
divisions within the Mormon--

502
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,389
>> Yeah.

503
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:47,973
>> See, I didn't even know that.

504
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,390
OK.

505
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,182
>> Yeah.

506
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:56,606
>> And so overall, basically,
the polygamy is not so much?

507
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,027
>> No, not in the main
Mormon church, no.

508
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:05,866
>> Because I've seen
some TV shows of--

509
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
>> Oh, like--

510
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,577
>> Where they go
into the lives of--

511
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,786
>> "Sister Wives" and-- yeah.

512
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,080
>> Yeah, and just glimpses.

513
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,249
And I'm like, oh,
that's interesting.

514
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,793
>> Well, they believe pretty
much a lot of the same stuff.

515
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,837
It's just the polygamy
that's been altered

516
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,756
that we have taken out
because we were getting

517
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,923
so much from the government.

518
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,841
>> I see.

519
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,969
>> So getting back
to the ET stuff,

520
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,931
you mentioned channeling a
Zeta and-- was it channeling,

521
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,060
or connecting with
a Zeta and a Mantis?

522
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,022
>> Well, I guess it would
be more of like a contact

523
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,814
experience.

524
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,691
They came to me and
just talked to me.

525
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,237
And my vibration had to be
raised so much that I didn't

526
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,530
feel like I could even move.

527
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,658
I was basically thrown down--
not thrown down by them.

528
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,703
But my energy felt
so transitioned

529
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,580
that I laid down on the couch.

530
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,084
And then they came over me.

531
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,880
And it just took a while for
me to even gain my energy back.

532
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,217
>> Because I've been exploring
my own personal connections

533
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,721
with both Zeta and Mantis,
could I ask what it felt like?

534
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,306
What did you--

535
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
>> I felt like I was
in a dizzy tunnel.

536
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,060
>> Were they coming
at the same time?

537
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,812
>> They came at the
same time, together.

538
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,191
They came together, and kind of
came toward me and spoke to me.

539
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,861
I felt like the Mantis was
doing something with my energy

540
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,489
to raise it enough where
I would understand, almost

541
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,200
like they were speaking
directly to me, like we are.

542
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,618
But obviously there
were no words.

543
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,664
>> The Gray was?

544
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,456
>> Yeah.

545
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,626
The Gray was speaking, and I
could understand it, almost

546
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,794
like you and I were talking.

547
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,587
>> So the Mantis was
more of a facilitator.

548
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,296
>> Yeah, yeah.

549
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,005
>> Just sort of being there.

550
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,216
>> It felt like it was doing
something with my energy

551
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,053
to raise it to a certain degree
where I could understand that.

552
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,638
>> And what did they say?

553
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,431
>> It was--

554
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,598
>> Or what did the Zeta say?

555
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:59,187
>> OK, so it said, basically,
you need to do your path.

556
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,897
You've been chosen for this.

557
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,608
And then they said all
this stuff in, like,

558
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,027
Egyptian that I--

559
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,656
I think they thought that maybe
it would click or something.

560
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,032
But I just didn't--

561
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,576
>> Well, what did it feel like?

562
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,537
>> It felt like ancient
information that you need

563
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:21,543
to reintroduce back into
the human consciousness.

564
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,503
>> Do you have an
idea of what that is?

565
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,296
>> Yeah.

566
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,341
So since then, I've done
meditations and clarified it,

567
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,387
and it always goes back
to the Egyptian times.

568
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,472
>> Which is-- what are
those messages, generally?

569
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,099
>> So there's a lot.

570
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,517
[CHUCKLES]

571
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,769
>> Just the short version.

572
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,231
>> I think the biggest thing for
that time period was there were

573
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,567
beings on the planet.

574
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,110
>> Already interacting
with humanity.

575
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,737
>> Yeah.

576
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,489
And when I go back
into my meditations,

577
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,158
they show me that there
are extraterrestrials

578
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:57,621
all over the place that are in
control of different paradigms

579
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,456
of the social structures.

580
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,293
And somewhere along the lines,
most particularly probably

581
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,795
the Roman times when
the Romans took over,

582
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,132
they transitioned it to be more
of a three-dimensional world.

583
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,052
And they sort of faded
in the background--

584
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,680
with control still, but we
are not able to see them.

585
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,351
And because of that, we
have become unconscious.

586
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,187
And so that's where all the
transitions have happened.

587
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,731
And so they just basically
want to reintroduce the idea

588
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,983
that they've always been here.

589
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,528
But the fact that--

590
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,947
they kind of say that
the cycles of the planet

591
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,115
have taken us into
a lower dimension,

592
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,993
and other beings took
advantage of that.

593
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,664
And so we stayed in three
dimension for a while.

594
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,915
>> Right.

595
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,167
Are you familiar with
the density terms?

596
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,503
Density levels
correlating with chakras?

597
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,295
>> Yeah.

598
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,632
So isn't it the
lower is your third,

599
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,551
and then it goes up higher
to the higher dimension?

600
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:58,223
>> Or density dimensions-- this
is sort of creating a thesaurus

601
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:03,603
of words to describe
these experiences.

602
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,566
And I like to use
the dimensional--

603
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,984
when I use the
term "dimensions,"

604
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,278
I correlate it with
actual scientific--

605
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,072
how the scientific community
says we're actually

606
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,951
in the fourth dimension with
X,Y, Z, or up, down, left,

607
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,997
right, and spacetime being the
fourth dimension for measuring

608
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,208
dimensional space and time.

609
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:30,672
And then fifth dimensional
concepts and ideas

610
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,008
would be getting out
of the linear concept.

611
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,721
So from A to B, no longer
going in that linear sense,

612
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,848
but jumping around
the spacetime.

613
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,183
And that gives a
fifth-dimensional perspective

614
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,020
on our reality.

615
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,814
Where I've noticed with some
of the other interviews,

616
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,400
and Lyssa Royal and others

617
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,570
used the term
"densities" to describe

618
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,573
the actual consciousness.

619
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,116
And we're sort of--

620
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:03,788
they say we're moving from
third to fourth density.

621
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,333
And I notice these terms kind
of get confusing sometimes,

622
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,503
as people say 3D, 4D.

623
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:17,844
So would you say more
of the third density,

624
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
the heaviness of the energy?

625
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,221
>> Yeah.

626
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,891
>> And then we're moving
into fourth density?

627
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,683
>> Yeah.

628
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,353
So what I understand
with that is we

629
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:32,692
were a fourth density or a fifth
dimensional-type being before.

630
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:37,572
And then I guess it was the way
that the cycles of the Earth

631
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,742
rotated, or however
it worked, beings

632
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,079
knew this, and came down,
and used these paradigms

633
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,166
to take and control
our fear and structure.

634
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,252
And we went down into density.

635
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,798
And some of us have
stayed here for a while.

636
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,051
And now that the earth has
done its cycle rotation,

637
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,719
we're able to come out of it.

638
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,721
>> Right.

639
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,847
>> Does that seem like it--

640
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,809
>> Matches right
with everything, yes.

641
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,810
Totally.

642
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:12,148
So the planet itself is it's
own higher dimensional density

643
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,108
being.

644
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,861
And we as densities-- beings--

645
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,572
on it have to evolve with her.

646
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,407
>> Yeah, yeah.

647
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,450
That's the perfect way,
because people get upset.

648
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,286
Like, how could the
beings come and do that

649
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,204
to our consciousness?

650
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,289
But it's like, we're
all doing this together.

651
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,627
And in a sense, in almost every
single one of my channelings,

652
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,504
it was basically
humanity's choice.

653
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,506
We let the fear overcome us.

654
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,342
We let that maintain
our consciousness.

655
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,553
And we just didn't
break out of it in time,

656
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,012
I guess, for
everything to evolve.

657
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,933
And we stayed with
it for a while.

658
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,644
>> Yeah, I was hoping later
today, in the channeling,

659
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,856
we can get into some of the
history a little bit more.

660
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:57,902
Fall of Atlantis, and these
cycles, and stuff like that.

661
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,947
And the human evolution.

662
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,115
>> Mm-hmm.

663
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,784
>> I think that was going
to be the main focus.

664
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,785
>> That's good.

665
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,246
>> Sounds like you've gotten
a lot of information on other

666
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,038
beings.

667
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,876
>> I think that's the
biggest scope of my path

668
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,253
as a channeler, because it can--

669
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,382
each channeler has their
things that they focus on.

670
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,677
And I feel like right now that's
what they want me to focus on,

671
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,263
because this is what
was needed, I guess,

672
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,765
for this evolution process.

673
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,599
>> Yeah.

674
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,478
And we can always
learn from our past.

675
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,563
Even though we're recreating
it in the moment now.

676
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,940
>> I know, I know.

677
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,568
>> Awesome.

678
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,280
So you've connected with
all these different beings.

679
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,243
Do you have one being that
you normally connect with?

680
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,580
Or is it just always random?

681
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,458
>> A lot of times it is
like the Council of Light,

682
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,084
if it's to do with healing.

683
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,837
If there's something
to do with healing.

684
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,798
It's just depending on the
question and things like that.

685
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,383
If it's something with origins.

686
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,427
>> And they call themselves--
is it a collective,

687
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,303
the Council of Light?

688
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:05,553
>> Yeah.

689
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,971
But they'll visually
show me who's

690
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,431
stepping forward, usually.

691
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,516
>> OK.

692
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:15,855
So within the council,
one person of the council

693
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,608
will step forward and say,
OK, on behalf of the council?

694
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,400
>> Yeah.

695
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,193
>> OK, cool.

696
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,154
>> Especially if that individual,

697
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,198
if they know that individual has
a specific question about

698
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,702
healing, with whatever reason,
they know how to answer that

699
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,537
question.

700
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,164
Maybe more than somebody
else or whatever.

701
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,624
>> Interesting.

702
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,377
>> But I do feel like, as far
as the origins in humanity,

703
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:44,342
it is more like ET and the
Draconis that I connect with.

704
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,635
Reptilian type stuff.

705
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,303
>> OK.

706
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,640
When you say the ET, so the
Draconis part of the ET stuff?

707
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,855
>> Yeah, but also just other ET
beings that maybe are not fully

708
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,482
part of the council with healing.

709
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:04,904
They just know about humanity,
and how things have fit in.

710
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,490
Such as Lyran beings
or things like that.

711
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,368
They have a lot of wisdom that
came with this time period,

712
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,203
and so they'll help
with that kind of thing,

713
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,539
if you're gaining knowledge.

714
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,331
>> Very cool.

715
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,958
Do you have a favorite?

716
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,710
>> Well, I like doing
the Reptilians and--

717
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,502
>> Yeah?

718
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,297
>> Yeah, their energy
is just so direct.

719
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,089
And I like that.

720
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,300
I don't like the
fluff of everything.

721
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,428
Let's just get to the reason
why we're here, and let's do it.

722
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,721
And that's how they are.

723
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,888
>> Nice, nice.

724
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,390
Very cool.

725
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,684
Do you think maybe later we
can talk to some Reptilians?

726
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,977
Let's see if they come through.

727
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,936
>> Yeah.

728
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,314
>> That'd be cool.

729
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:44,485
Yeah, my process over
this, doing this series,

730
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:49,032
has been learning and
categorizing, and learning

731
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
about these different energies.

732
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:58,708
And the Reptilians-- we had
one super happy-go-lucky TReb

733
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,336
come through Rob
Gauthier, a Reptilian.

734
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,254
But other than that,
I really haven't

735
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,214
tapped into too many other--

736
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,217
personally, I've sort of seeked
out and seen and connected

737
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,010
with.

738
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,803
But I think that would
be nice, to introduce--

739
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,888
>> So have you seen any?

740
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,557
Like, in your meditations?

741
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,350
>> Reptilians?

742
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,061
>> Mm-hmm.

743
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,145
>> No, actually.

744
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,023
Well, I-- kind of.

745
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:27,945
But not in a
communicative sense,

746
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:32,116
where they're creating
a rapport of question

747
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,076
answers kind of thing.

748
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,038
Just images and feelings.

749
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,415
>> They just kind of flew
by your line of vision.

750
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,292
>> Yeah, sort of Reptilians.

751
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:47,674
And I sort of got one one
time during a meditation.

752
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:53,846
I saw this really nasty, dark--

753
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,350
claws and teeth and snouts
and all that stuff coming in.

754
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,519
And then for a second,
for a split second,

755
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,438
I was really afraid.

756
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,358
But then immediately I was like,
well, no, that's super cool.

757
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,485
Look at how cool that
is, looking at it

758
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,239
from the little
boy's perspective.

759
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,117
Like a "Jurassic Park"
or something like--

760
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,538
kids love dinosaurs, and
playing with that stuff.

761
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,081
It's a cool factor.

762
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,000
And as soon as I did
that, it shifted,

763
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,794
and it turned into a cartoon.

764
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,254
>> Oh, really?

765
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,131
>> And it was kind
of like Shrek.

766
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,923
>> Oh.

767
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,801
>> You know how he tries to
be the mean giant in front

768
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,595
of everybody, but he's
just a cuddly Shrek guy.

769
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,305
>> That's funny.

770
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,306
>> That was the analogy.

771
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,142
I was like, it's just
about your perspective

772
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,853
and how you look
at these things.

773
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,690
Which creates them, right?

774
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:52,238
So in reality, it was just a
lovable cartoon puffy dragon

775
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,030
thing.

776
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,823
>> That is what

777
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,325
I've heard that
you can transmute

778
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,328
what you're seeing into
something more lovable

779
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,705
or in the light kind of thing.

780
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,497
>> Yeah.

781
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,666
So that was-- and I think
that was the lesson,

782
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,587
that it was coming
through and saying, hey,

783
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,006
we're not all scary, nasty--

784
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,007
we can be cool.

785
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,178
It's just you guys are
so used to perception.

786
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,222
You're so trained, oh,
this is bad, this is good.

787
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,766
So if you let go of
all that, there's

788
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,517
actually something
really cool to be seen.

789
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:28,608
And even lovable and happy and
good with the Reptilian stuff.

790
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,528
But conditioning-- even
in the New Age community,

791
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:37,992
the conditioning of Reptilians
has not been the greatest.

792
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,119
They've sort of had,
you know, stay away

793
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,538
from the Reptilians, or the
evil Reptilian government,

794
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,540
the Illuminati, and all that.

795
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,417
Of course, that
faction and those--

796
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
they do exist.

797
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,505
But for us to--

798
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,467
I think it's time for us to
embrace all of that side of us.

799
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,052
Because we all have
Reptilian in us.

800
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,844
>> Yeah.

801
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,264
Well, as far as I know, there
are the ancient Reptilians.

802
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,391
And then, like I
said, there's more

803
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,686
the lower dimensional that just
want to be in fourth density.

804
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,480
And they don't want
to evolve right now.

805
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,524
And those are the ones
that are kind of like, OK.

806
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,609
But the other ones,
they're very wise,

807
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,152
and they have a lot
of intelligence.

808
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,862
>> That dragon's been
around a long time.

809
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,281
>> Yes, he has.

810
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,242
>> And there's a reason.

811
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,034
It's funny.

812
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:25,248
I actually had-- and I was
in an ayahuasca journey.

813
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,501
And this was right--

814
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,672
literally days after
the election of Trump.

815
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:41,806
And I saw Trump as this wise
dragon, flying around the room.

816
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:46,602
And it was something-- because
there's so much fear around

817
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,395
that.

818
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,438
And there was other people
in the ceremony that

819
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,858
thought we were all going to
be put in concentration camps

820
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,195
and taken away.

821
00:35:56,195 --> 00:36:01,450
I saw the energy of
what Trump is here.

822
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,578
I'm not-- whoever's
watching this,

823
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,705
I'm not a big Trump supporter.

824
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,540
I'm not saying that's--

825
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,625
>> It was just maybe
what you needed to see.

826
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
>> It's just what I
need to see to say, hey,

827
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,422
let's not be afraid of this.
Don't be afraid of the energy.

828
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:19,177
Instead, maybe there is
some wisdom behind it.

829
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,637
Not saying that he's conscious
of any kind of wisdom.

830
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,056
But there should be--

831
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,434
whatever energy is coming
through there for the planet

832
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,811
and for the lessons that we
need to learn at this time,

833
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:34,233
it could be this ancient
Reptilian wise energy

834
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,694
to help move us
through our evolution.

835
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,154
It's all here to serve.

836
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,614
Otherwise it wouldn't
be happening.

837
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,448
>> Yeah.

838
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,282
I like that.

839
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,909
>> Well, actually,
I wanted to ask you.

840
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:47,079
So your process, I've noticed,
online, from the videos

841
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,872
I've seen.

842
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,332
It's sort of a
little bit different

843
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,542
than your traditional channeler.

844
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,338
It's almost like you're
translating in real time.

845
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,674
And sometimes I've seen you
go full talking as the being.

846
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,467
>> Yeah.

847
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,345
>> I think most people who are
familiar with this show are

848
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:11,103
used to people sort of embracing
the energy of that being.

849
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,731
And I'm sort of having a
conversation with that being.

850
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,774
How does it work for you?

851
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,402
>> So initially I did let
myself completely go into more

852
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,323
of a deeper trance, and I took
on the energy of the being.

853
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,868
I have trained myself to
hold back a little bit

854
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,121
to be a little bit more present
and use my own personality

855
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,164
in communicating.

856
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,083
>> OK.

857
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,462
>> Just because I feel like
there are some information

858
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,255
in advance--

859
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,131
not advance, but there's
a lot of information

860
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,716
that people are
just still trying

861
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,220
to get a grip on that I feel
like I need to explain it

862
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,350
in my own terms, versus using
the personality of the being.

863
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,020
But it just depends
on what is needed.

864
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,939
And the deep trance--

865
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:59,610
I definitely initially got
into a deeper trance.

866
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,112
>> So when you go
into deeper trance,

867
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,490
are you still able to
hear the information?

868
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,159
>> Yeah, I'm just not able
to communicate with you

869
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,828
as clearly.

870
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,664
I'm just totally replaced.

871
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,874
>> But the information that's
coming through is clear

872
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,375
information?

873
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,209
>> Yeah.

874
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,839
So that would be good for--
like right now, you and I--

875
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,302
or even maybe doing something
over interview on YouTube.

876
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,555
But as far as personal
channeling, it's easier for me

877
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,514
to stay more present.

878
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,725
And that's why I've trained
myself to kind of like....

879
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,351
>> So you can be present
to ask the questions.

880
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:32,893
>> Yeah.

881
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,686
>> OK.

882
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,939
Otherwise you don't know
what's coming through.

883
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,732
>> Yeah.

884
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,109
>> So when you're by
yourself, it's more of that--

885
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,902
I'm having a conversation
with this being.

886
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,695
>> Yeah.

887
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,532
>> But in this case, would
you just go full trance then?

888
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,784
>> I think full trance
would probably--

889
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,245
maybe even a little bit
more toward my personality.

890
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,207
But more into trance than a
private channeling session.

891
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,000
>> I see.

892
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,794
>> Because sometimes the
client will stop you and ask

893
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,628
questions.

894
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,921
And then you have to
come back out of it,

895
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,381
and then you have
to go back in it.

896
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,216
So it's better just to
keep a middle ground.

897
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,009
>> I see.

898
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,093
Interesting.

899
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,638
I noticed one channeling
where you were bringing in--

900
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,349
I think it was a
Reptilian energy.

901
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,809
Or no, it was--

902
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,019
was it a Reptilian?

903
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,398
One of these ancient
bearded guys.

904
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,233
>> Ancient bearded guys?

905
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,445
>> And he was one of these
bigger tall beings that lived

906
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,404
on Earth.

907
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,947
>> Oh, the red-haired giant.

908
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,074
>> The red-haired giants.

909
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,533
>> Yeah, that was a weird--

910
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:29,700
>> Yeah.

911
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,244
You were saying just physically
how it felt. And you're like,

912
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,287
this is just weird.

913
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,622
>> It was weird.

914
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,875
>> So was it just weird because
it wasn't like anything else

915
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,709
that you've against?

916
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,502
>> Yeah.

917
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,712
That's exactly-- it wasn't
like anything I had felt.

918
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,256
It was like I was
talking to somebody

919
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,760
that looked like a human,
but it felt like an animal.

920
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,677
>> Oh, OK.

921
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,470
Right, right.

922
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,346
>> Yeah.

923
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,263
>> Animalistic energy.

924
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,474
>> Yes.

925
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,977
>> Yeah, and I remember watching
that and sort of feeling that

926
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,312
as well.

927
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,481
Any other strange,
weird energies

928
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,652
that you want to mention?

929
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,531
>> I will mention channeling
Brigham Young is quite

930
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,407
interesting.

931
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,534
>> And he was the one
who found the skeletons?

932
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,368
No.

933
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,287
>> He was the one that
took the Mormons--

934
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,080
>> Oh.

935
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,834
>> --from the region in
Illinois over to establish what

936
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,377
the church is today.

937
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,504
So built up pretty much
all of Salt Lake City.

938
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,338
>> Wow.

939
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,464
So you channeled that--

940
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,799
you channeled him?

941
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,342
>> He actually came to me.

942
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,178
And it was very intense.

943
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,265
And it's interesting
because Utah

944
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,601
is named after a raptor,
which is a Reptilian.

945
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:42,148
And he's got a lot of
Reptilian-type energy.

946
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,151
And he has just a lot--

947
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:45,943
I don't know.

948
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,987
It was just a very
weird energy, I

949
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,030
felt like, when he came to me.

950
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,365
>> In that interview?

951
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,451
That energy on your website?

952
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,744
>> So when I was
like, all right,

953
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,705
let's make a YouTube
of the channeling,

954
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:02,543
he actually switched and made it
a little bit more light-hearted

955
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,627
and loving.

956
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
Because I felt like--

957
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,297
maybe he did that
because the collective

958
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,507
wasn't ready to hear what
he was actually telling me.

959
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,385
>> Oh, OK.

960
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,804
>> Because there is a lot
of reasons why religion was

961
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,139
brought here in the first place.

962
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,433
And some of them aren't
so good, because it

963
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,643
can capture our consciousness.

964
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,062
And he was part of that.

965
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,356
>> He was part of the--

966
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,649
bringing it here, right?

967
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,652
>> He was part of making
it into what it is today.

968
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,530
Sort of capturing
that consciousness

969
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,118
to keep it into a childlike
state, versus expanding.

970
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,995
>> Can you go into depth
a little about that?

971
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:42,833
>> So basically, what I
understand is Joseph Smith was

972
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,878
here to bring in
information from the past,

973
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:51,258
and to help others
understand where we were.

974
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,553
Then created a
religion because of it.

975
00:41:54,553 --> 00:42:00,601
Brigham Young actually,
after Joseph had passed over,

976
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,395
took all of the saints
over to this region

977
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,314
and established the church.

978
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:12,821
And I guess used that
information against the people.

979
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,742
So it was good initially,
but it was transformed--

980
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,701
>> As all religions.

981
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,494
>> Yeah.

982
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,370
And he really does--

983
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,081
Brigham Young really does
have a very dark energy.

984
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,457
I feel like there
was a lot going

985
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,459
on at that time that really--

986
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,252
yeah.

987
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:31,006
>> Well, how long ago was
this, when he came through?

988
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,591
>> I don't know,
maybe a year ago?

989
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,425
Maybe?

990
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,677
Yeah.

991
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,096
>> Because I could see that
definitely would be some

992
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,013
blowback.

993
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,765
You could definitely get a
blowback from the community.

994
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,307
>> Yeah.

995
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,934
They were kind of
like, that's not safe

996
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,519
for you to do that right now.

997
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,311
>> To put that out.

998
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,730
>> But individually, if they
come to you and ask questions

999
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,315
in a private channel,
we can do that.

1000
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,528
>> Again--
collectively, though--

1001
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,114
we all choose to
have this experience.

1002
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:59,285
So he's just a facilitator
for that collective desire--

1003
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,787
>> Yeah.

1004
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:06,250
>> --to experience this
religious constraints,

1005
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,881
or disempowerment,
or whatever it is.

1006
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,467
So again, another perspective.

1007
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,886
Not to look at him
as this bad guy, or--

1008
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,929
>> That's really good.

1009
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,722
I love that.

1010
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,016
Especially because,
at the time, Joseph

1011
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,309
channeled a lot of information

1012
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,311
that was beneficial.

1013
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,396
And then people-- he
built this church,

1014
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,231
and people were coming to him.

1015
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,567
Oh, should I plant this
type of seed in my yard?

1016
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,484
Should I do this?

1017
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,778
And then all of a sudden
you're giving your power away

1018
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,324
to somebody else, when you're
able to tap into that yourself.

1019
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,951
And obviously, like we
said, you could use that

1020
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,744
for good or evil.

1021
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,246
And the leadership
was taken to use--

1022
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,998
come to me for all
of your problems,

1023
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,541
and I'll make it right.

1024
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,334
>> Right.

1025
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,043
>> And they allowed it.

1026
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:49,960
The people allowed it.

1027
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,836
>> Yeah.

1028
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,755
So you get what you ask for.

1029
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,882
>> [LAUGHS] Yeah.

1030
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,091
>> Interesting.

1031
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,384
Well, cool.

1032
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,219
Well, I do look
forward to seeing

1033
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:04,683
what other energies come through
later today and the future

1034
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,476
of your work.

1035
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:05,976
So, definitely.

1036
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,477
>> Thanks.

1037
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,311
Thank you.

1038
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,228
>> Thank you.
