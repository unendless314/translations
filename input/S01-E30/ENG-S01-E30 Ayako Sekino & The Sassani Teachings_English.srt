1
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:04,022
It's exciting to go back to 
our original, infinite consciousness.

2
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,443
We've been existing on Earth 
with limiting beliefs.

3
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,738
We've created a planet of separation

4
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:16,451
and lifestyles that are 
a source of stress for everyone.

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,706
But from here on out, we'll truly
begin to open and embrace infinity.

6
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,752
Everyone will be able to access
the information that is within.

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,172
The realities we manifest
will reflect that excitement.

8
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,886
When we know everything comes from within,
friction and conflicts will vanish.

9
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,640
We don't have to take things from others.

10
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:47,649
We've remained asleep by focusing
very strongly on the external reality.

11
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,819
So the outside reality seems
very tangible to us.

12
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,363
It looks like it's really happening.

13
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,950
However, awakening means

14
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,204
you start redirecting all that attention
on the outside back to yourself.

15
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,497
As you do this

16
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:07,043
your infinite consciousness
becomes much more tangible.

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,255
And reality starts to become "soft".

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:18,138
We'll have nothing to cling on to,
but that's part of the process.

19
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,141
Our old grab bars will
start to fall apart.

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,062
We'll learn that the ways 
we'd known don't function anymore.

21
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,399
That's when we stop and pause
for the first time

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,695
to allow new information to flow through.

23
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,240
That's where 
you can start from zero again.

24
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,952
Then you'll allow new perspectives.

25
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,413
That's where we're headed.

26
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,659
We're here with Ms. Ayako.
Or is it Sekino?

27
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,994
Sekino Ayako.

28
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,164
Right, Sekino Ayako
because in Japanese it's flipped.

29
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,250
In English we say Ayako Sekino.

30
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm planning to cover
a number of topics with you today.

31
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,758
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

32
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:46,554
Ok, first off, I wanted to ask this.

33
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,309
On the internet 
you can find a few videos of

34
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:58,608
you and the entity known as Bashar,
channeled by Darryl Anka.

35
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:03,362
I found out about you from those videos.

36
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:08,993
What's the connection?
Can you give us a brief explanation?

37
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,501
Darryl came to Japan 
to offer channeling sessions.

38
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,880
I think it was around 1985.

39
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:28,179
At that time I didn't believe in aliens.
I had no interest in them whatsoever.

40
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,809
When I heard that 
somebody was going to channel an alien

41
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,188
I looked at it as a form of entertainment
and went to the event.

42
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:43,194
It was a three-hour session where 
Darryl channeled Bashar.

43
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,656
I had no idea what he was talking about.

44
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,411
Because, you know,
it was 30 years ago.

45
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,623
Earth was still very much asleep
and ensconced in limitations.

46
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,501
Bashar's perspective was 
so revolutionary.

47
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,963
It came from such a higher realm.
It was so freeing. 

48
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,216
His message was to follow our excitement.

49
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:10,346
But the gap was too wide at that time.
It just didn't sink in.

50
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:17,103
But after that session,
about a week later 

51
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,525
when I was asleep, I had a dream. 

52
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,446
Now, looking back
I know it wasn't a dream.

53
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,117
I was on Essassani.

54
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
-The planet?
-Yes.

55
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,164
I believe I was on a mother ship.

56
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,543
I was inside a spacecraft.

57
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:49,427
And then I had the feeling that 
I wanted to go home.

58
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,014
I thought 
"I'd better keep my eyes closed."

59
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,142
Then I sensed a presence behind me.

60
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,437
I thought, "no matter what
don't turn around."

61
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,147
-Were you scared?
-Yes.

62
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,277
I knew something very strange 
was happening.

63
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,740
Then there was a glass in front of me.

64
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:17,163
It curved and extended all around
inside the spacecraft.

65
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,416
I saw something flying outside.

66
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,879
Were you aware that
you were inside a spacecraft?

67
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,591
No, the concept of a spacecraft
was foreign to me.

68
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,135
-Just a strange place to you?
-Yes.

69
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,305
I'd somehow landed 
in a very different space,

70
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,059
and I just knew that I wanted to go home.

71
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:46,025
I went closer to the window,
wondering what's going on out there?

72
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,863
It was then that I saw 
triangular shaped UFOs

73
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,784
flying in at an extreme angle.

74
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
There were so many.

75
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,081
-Out in Space?
-Yes, outside in Space.

76
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,627
I was inside the spacecraft 
looking out of the window.

77
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,629
I could see triangular UFOs

78
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,925
showing their underside, flying,
spiraling around in space.

79
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,096
I'd never seen an UFO in my life,

80
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,266
and in front of my eyes were
actual UFOs.

81
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,269
I was like "Wow! I saw UFOs!" 

82
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,563
"I have to tell all my friends!"

83
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:31,571
There was still this presence behind me
and I didn't want to turn around.

84
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,077
The window was all around inside
and I saw a door over to the left.

85
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,121
A door to the outside.

86
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,542
Making sure I didn't look behind me,
I walked toward the door.

87
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,254
There was a small flight of stairs,
leading outside.

88
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,006
So I went out.

89
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,383
And then... 

90
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
It was like a park.

91
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,557
There was a lot of vegetation,
like a grassy field.

92
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,559
There was water too.

93
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:06,564
In terms of what we know here on Earth,
something like a fountain.

94
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,570
The whole landscape radiated 
such incredible energy.

95
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:18,993
It was so nice that my body felt
it would melt into it.

96
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,831
There was an indescribable 
feeling of peace and harmony.

97
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,126
Not the sort we know on earth.

98
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,421
True harmony and peace.

99
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:35,426
All the anxiety in my body
dissolved at once.

100
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,848
That's when I turned around
because I was feeling so relaxed.

101
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,603
I saw a set of huge almond shaped eyes.

102
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,897
It was Bashar.

103
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,859
What struck me the most were

104
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:56,906
his almond shaped eyes
and his really large head.

105
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,327
You mean his head was really this big?

106
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,999
All I could focus on were those eyes.
They were so captivating.

107
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,753
I was so surprised that
I reacted like a child.

108
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,884
Just like a scared child
I jumped out of my skin!

109
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,679
It was with that shock I found myself,

110
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,309
back on Earth in my bed.

111
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,771
I opened my eyes and saw the ceiling.

112
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,775
But I knew, in my heart,

113
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,779
what I'd just experienced wasn't a dream.

114
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,824
"It hadn't been a dream."

115
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,660
"There are things out there"

116
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:48,040
"that we are never taught on Earth,
in school or by other adults."

117
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:54,630
This knowing was deep within me, 
and resonating into my core.

118
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,341
My body wouldn't move.

119
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,386
My energy hadn't fully 
returned to my body.

120
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,388
But I knew...

121
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,934
"I'll get my energy back in ten minutes
and be able to move again."

122
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,103
"This is not a dream."

123
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,523
"My state of consciousness will expand."

124
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,237
"There are all sorts of things
that I'd never been taught on Earth."

125
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:23,242
And I was allowing these things to happen.
That's how I felt.

126
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,830
Then after ten minutes,
I was able to move, and I got up.

127
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,460
Once I was fully awake,

128
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:38,758
I thought of these triangular crafts
swirling upward and down again.

129
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:44,430
They would made a loop, showing me 
the pattern on their underside.

130
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,768
There were thick lines drawn in.

131
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,396
That left a strong impression on me.

132
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,443
Considering the level of the
Earth's consciousness at that time,

133
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:04,033
to tell somebody I'd met an alien 
was absolutely inconceivable.

134
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,120
I believed that
people would think I was crazy.

135
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,414
It's not my belief anymore.

136
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,752
I called my now-husband, Naoyuki.

137
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,007
At that time he was Darryl's Interpreter
during Bashar's channeling sessions.

138
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,220
I told him that I had seen UFOs.

139
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,431
He was amused and brought me a picture

140
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,519
which showed the exact markings
I had seen in my experience.

141
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:38,609
The picture he brought me was
drawn by Bashar through Darryl.

142
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:46,325
It was exactly the same markings 
that I had seen on Essassani in my dream.

143
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,663
It's hard to explain
to anybody but myself.

144
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:57,086
That experience really made me
wonder about dreams.

145
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,674
Because the times were what they were,
I didn't talk to anyone about it.

146
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,677
-You never had that sort of experience?
-Not at all!

147
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,388
You were leading the "normal" 
Japanese life.

148
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,766
Yes, totally! I was really...

149
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,101
A regular person.

150
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:17,398
Even when I saw aliens on TV
I had absolutely no interest.

151
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,857
Entertainment, right?

152
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,528
I didn't even care to know 
whether aliens existed or not.

153
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:27,783
But my consciousness was 
expanding through myself.

154
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,664
I was gaining new information
with expanded consciousness

155
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,584
which came back online.

156
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,296
It was a radical change.

157
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,426
-So that was the trigger for a lot of...
-Yes, it really was!

158
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,723
I knew that everything in my life
would change.

159
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:58,147
Things like common sense were
important to me up to that point.

160
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,567
I thought the collective 
opinion to be always correct.

161
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,279
That it was safest to align myself with

162
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,908
what the majority regarded
as being the truth.

163
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,994
Your common sense had changed?

164
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,998
-It broke.
-Oh, that can be problematic.

165
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,877
But for me, there was a certainty.

166
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,838
"I want to know," I thought.

167
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,550
I couldn't dismiss my experience
as just a dream.

168
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,012
I wanted to know the truth of it.

169
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,182
So about a month after the event, 

170
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,730
I was gazing at infinite space.

171
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:44,193
I thought, "This is outer space"
because there seemed to be stars.

172
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,613
But then, I understood

173
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,618
that was just all my consciousness
that I had yet to tap into.

174
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,496
And I got a little scared because

175
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:01,877
I'd been taught to live a certain way
using but a fragment of my consciousness.

176
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:09,927
But I realized that my consciousness
was as vast as the Universe.

177
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,597
It was the first time
I ever connected with it.

178
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,101
It was so vast, so limitless.

179
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,231
Because I had never experienced
to feel limitless, it was scary.

180
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
But then... 

181
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,320
The knowledge that "everything is here"

182
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:33,117
immediately filled me 
with a sense of infinite peace.

183
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,327
What kind of peace?

184
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,832
As I saw the true expanse of 
my consciousness as vast as the Universe

185
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,084
I knew everything to be there.

186
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,923
That my true consciousness holds
as much information

187
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,551
as the Universe itself.

188
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,846
All the information is there.

189
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,434
Far beyond you learn just here on Earth.

190
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:03,105
And knowing everything to be there 
was a source of profound peace.

191
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,108
It was a peacefulness
I'd never experienced.

192
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,571
Even though the sense of having
no limitation felt overwhelming...

193
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,284
So there is no need to search
for answers outside ourselves?

194
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,954
-Because it's all inside?
-That's right.

195
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,248
-Because it's so big?
-Yes.

196
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,960
It's as big as the Universe.

197
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,048
That's the consciousness of my true self.

198
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
I came to understand that.

199
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,385
Once I realized that,

200
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,973
I wanted to exist here on Earth,
using that consciousness.

201
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,312
Not the Earthly consciousness
I'd been using with its limitations,

202
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,440
belief systems and common sense.

203
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,445
I wished to use the totality of
my consciousness 

204
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:56,575
as expansive, free, peaceful
as the Universe.

205
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,455
Knowing everything is here fills you
with such profound peace.

206
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:06,418
That serenity and our true consciousness,

207
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,588
that's what I wanted to experience
here on Earth.

208
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,924
So from there, I...

209
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:18,388
-You returned to the feeling before birth?
-True, very true.

210
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,350
I started to ask myself.

211
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,604
"To what extent
have I been using limitations,"

212
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:31,360
"perspectives, and common sense
that I've been taught to believe true?"

213
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,322
As I became aware of those layers,

214
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,327
I began to let them go progressively
as I wanted to return to my true self.

215
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,080
That was the beginning.

216
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,209
From there, a lot of things
began to crumble within myself.

217
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:52,131
When I thought "I can only go this far"
I let go of that limitation.

218
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:58,220
And I began to expand into the vastness
of my universal consciousness.

219
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,350
This went on 24/7, even during my sleep.

220
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,521
There was this one particular incident.

221
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,482
Do you know about the Akashic Records?

222
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,775
Yes.

223
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:17,239
That information was somehow
accessed and began flowing through me.

224
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,827
And it was constantly 
coming from my mouth.

225
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,288
-Speaking it?
-Yes.

226
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:29,001
I was talking even during my sleep.

227
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,005
It was so noisy that I'd wake myself up.

228
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,801
And I'd realize it was only me
so I'd go back to sleep.

229
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,096
Many things within me were
coming back online.

230
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,973
Was it your own Akashic?

231
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,727
No, it was the Universe's
Akashic Record, I think.

232
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,857
Did you receive the information
as images or feelings?

233
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,862
Or did they come out in a combination?

234
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,575
Was one expression stronger?
Mostly images?

235
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,203
Or mostly words?

236
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:10,042
I'd see images and
that would be translated into words.

237
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,004
Like in a movie, all this
information would come at once.

238
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,467
So as I watched the images
I would translate them.

239
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
-Like an interpreter?
-Exactly. 

240
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,932
A part of me that is aware of
what was taking place was

241
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,311
allowing the download for
the part of me that is unaware.

242
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,523
So the information was accessed
through the part of me who knew.

243
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,360
It was a restoration of sorts.

244
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,906
There was the "limited me"
who had been fast asleep on Earth.

245
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,785
She'd forgotten that
all the information was right there.

246
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,081
It was like remembering it
through this process.

247
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,461
Did you understand the images
you were seeing?

248
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,965
No, there was no need for me
to comprehend it.

249
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:03,345
This was only happening to restore
the knowing part of my consciousness.

250
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,350
I was much too "asleep" then to
comprehend what was being presented to me.

251
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:14,064
I knew it was okay not to be able to
understand right then.

252
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:20,529
But I also knew that my "truth" was being
downloaded more and more.

253
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:25,534
That the aspects of me that were
preventing the truth from coming through

254
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,787
were starting to fall away.

255
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,956
I was aware of that.

256
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:36,545
But I knew I didn't need to
understand the information at that time.

257
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:42,384
I knew that in time I'd come to
understand what is relevant, and also

258
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,555
it was like creating a better pathway.

259
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,390
Clearing the pipe.

260
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,687
Come to think of it, this was right before
Bashar began contacting me.

261
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,398
I feel this was a step in preparation

262
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,527
to become the clearest pipe for him
as much as possible.

263
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:06,283
So that the part of me who was
asleep wouldn't get in the way,

264
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,747
and allow the high-frequency information
to be downloaded.

265
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:18,962
So in July 1987,

266
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:27,304
when Bashar contacted me,
it was incredibly smooth.

267
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,139
I see.

268
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,478
Did you say, it went on 24/7?

269
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
After the dream?

270
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:42,611
Yes, part of my consciousness
that was asleep was cracked open.

271
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:50,744
And the downloading began to facilitate
the higher information to flow into me.

272
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,040
This process went on for days on end,
for about a month.

273
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,168
Sometimes, I would just be sitting

274
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,463
and I'd suddenly lose consciousness.

275
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:06,051
For about five or ten minutes.

276
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,347
And then I'd wake up just as quickly.

277
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,643
This was so I didn't get in the way.

278
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,897
Since this incoming information was so
different from what I knew

279
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:24,653
it was better for me to be unconscious
so that I wouldn't question it.

280
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,655
Makes it more accessible, I see.

281
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,786
Without warning, I would slip into it
and come back to myself just as quickly.

282
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,205
That went on for about a month.

283
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:40,043
-I bet everyone was worried.
-I told no one about it.

284
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,965
-How about when you passed out?
-Only happened when I was alone.

285
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,803
So you didn't pass out in front of anyone?

286
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,639
No, there was none of that.

287
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,809
-If that was the case...
-Yes, they'd ask what's wrong.

288
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:01,940
Whoever was doing it, he or she
had consideration for me.

289
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:07,821
Did you ever think,
"Oh no, I need to go to the hospital!"

290
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,365
Never. I was fine.

291
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:15,412
-You knew.
-I had extreme faith and trust.

292
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:22,419
I have a friend who had absolutely
no interest in UFOs.

293
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:27,966
But she had a sudden download and 
contacted me, freaking out.

294
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,887
She said, "I'm scared! 
Should I go to the hospital?"

295
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,847
People come to me like that.

296
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,726
Soon we'll have the opposite reaction.

297
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,188
Everyone's consciousness will 
start to expand.

298
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:46,026
Our gaze will widen into space,
giving ourselves permission to awaken.

299
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,402
I agree.

300
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,448
There are more and more people
who are aware

301
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:56,870
that there's more than this tiny box
and opening up their minds.

302
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,750
It's exciting to go back to 
our original, infinite consciousness.

303
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,420
We've been existing on Earth 
with limiting beliefs.

304
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,590
We've created a planet of separation

305
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:13,303
and lifestyles that are 
a source of stress for everyone.

306
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,058
But from here on out, we'll truly
begin to open and embrace infinity.

307
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,770
Everyone will be able to access
the information that is within.

308
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,023
The realities we manifest
will reflect that excitement.

309
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,612
When we know everything comes from within,
friction and conflicts will vanish.

310
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,074
We don't have to take things from others.

311
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,244
Do you know about David Icke?

312
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:43,333
He's become famous within circles
of people who follow stuff like this.

313
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,255
He speaks of lizard, no,
I mean, reptilian.

314
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:54,261
Reptilian way of doing things.
The way of apprehending life.

315
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,180
Let's call it "Yakuza Mind."

316
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:01,935
A pyramidal organization.
People at the top of the triangle.

317
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:07,816
-Like on the American dollar bill.
-Ah yes, the pyramid.

318
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,653
A few individuals maintaining
their position at the top.

319
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,409
People fighting to get to the top.
That idea or consciousness.

320
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,413
It's a structure where everyone
becomes a slave

321
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,667
for the sake of the very top people.

322
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,547
Like the political system
that we've been using.

323
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,092
The system that has been
running our planet.

324
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,138
The top controls, the bottom follows.

325
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:45,604
The top people are considered winners
and the bottom can only follow them.

326
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,941
And those who refuse to fit in
that system are labeled as the enemy.

327
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,237
This pyramidal structure will 
begin to shift into a different form.

328
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,991
I see it as a symphony where
each individual contributes

329
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,243
with their own talents.

330
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,165
There is the idea of equality
that everybody stands equal

331
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,002
with no top or bottom placing.

332
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,963
Everyone is equal and equally important,

333
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,718
in the various positions
each with its own importance.

334
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,721
In schools and society

335
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,016
the pyramidal structure
has been systemized.

336
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:28,730
You just followed that flow by default.
That's how our society has been built.

337
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,483
Now it's crumbling apart fast.

338
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,027
That's extremely positive!

339
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:39,199
It's fun for me.
But it may be scary for others.

340
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:45,205
We'll have nothing to cling on to,
but that's part of the process.

341
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,000
Our old grab bars will
start to fall apart.

342
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,046
We'll learn that the ways 
we'd known don't function anymore.

343
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,341
That's when we stop and pause
for the first time

344
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:00,637
to allow new information to flow through.

345
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,057
That's where 
you can start from zero again.

346
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,936
Then you'll allow new perspectives.

347
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,688
That's where we're headed.

348
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:14,067
I agree.
And that's fun and exciting.

349
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,652
To me, anyway.

350
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:21,950
For the majority, I think the excitement
will come when that realization hits.

351
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,201
Yes.

352
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:32,252
But like you already are, Reuben,
and just as I experienced,

353
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:39,134
there are individuals who have realized
the vastness of their true consciousness.

354
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:45,432
They've realized that it contains
everything that the Universe contains.

355
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,144
Those people are grounded 
and don't waver.

356
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:53,106
For example, somebody might say

357
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:57,819
"You believe in aliens?
How very weird!"

358
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:02,824
But they don't waver.
There is no doubt in their hearts.

359
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,161
Thanks to the emergence of 
such individuals,

360
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:12,542
others can learn that it's now safe
to be open to new perspectives.

361
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,672
But in the process of their awakening,
one may begin to doubt themselves.

362
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,383
When they are subjected to
harsh criticism

363
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,428
they waver, thinking
"Maybe what I'm doing is weird."

364
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,557
That makes others decide
it's safer to remain where they are.

365
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:32,604
There will come a time when there are 
so many people on this Earth

366
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,900
who are truly open and 
remain strong in their truth.

367
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,277
That's when grounding happens.

368
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:45,325
They exist with a consciousness that's
free of preconceptions and limitations.

369
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:50,580
When those people begin to
reveal themselves on this planet

370
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:56,753
they'll show others that everything can be
exciting, easy and simple.

371
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:02,342
Inventors and the like, there will be
more and more of them.

372
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,428
Until now inventors were
regarded as special.

373
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,306
Now anyone can become one.

374
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,601
These people will remain strongly
grounded in their truth.

375
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:17,232
They don't waver when they are told that
the mainstream perspective is correct.

376
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,902
They know that anyone can become free.

377
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,823
That anyone can return to
their infinite consciousness.

378
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,910
When they share that knowing
with complete conviction,

379
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,789
they'll incite others to
shift into that space as well.

380
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,666
When you're in doubt,

381
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,211
others will react as
"This sounds dangerous."

382
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,341
But there will be unwavered people 
who will show others a way.

383
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,761
We'll see more of these people soon.

384
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,932
They'll become living examples
for others to awaken,

385
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,520
while remaining powerfully grounded
in this physical reality.

386
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,525
And more and more people will
also feel compelled to do so.

387
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,071
Also children who are being born now

388
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,117
are beings from the Universe
as we all are.

389
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:15,290
But they come with the knowing that
they don't need to use limitations.

390
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:20,795
They refuse regulations at school and
don't let themselves put into a mold.

391
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,882
They'll show true ease and natural talent.

392
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,678
For example, they might start drawing
without taking any lessons.

393
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,891
Or start playing piano like Beethoven
without training.

394
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,312
-There will be more children like that.
-I see many of them already.

395
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:43,401
They'll start showing the adults
what is now possible.

396
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,614
As I've said, these new children,

397
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,325
Well, they aren't actually children.

398
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,535
They're little people

399
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,456
who know they don't need 
the limitations of the Earth.

400
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,334
They'll work hand in hand with adults

401
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:05,006
to open the parts of their consciousness
which had remained closed until now.

402
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,885
And re-integrate that sense of
limitless possibility.

403
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,140
As they're grounded in that knowledge,
they can offer an example to those

404
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:20,480
who are in doubt and afraid of
the uncertainties of the future.

405
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,858
They'll get a sense of relief

406
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,362
and the possibility of 
shifting to a new way of life.

407
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,031
They'll feel much more stable.

408
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,577
So you're supporting those
who do not waver

409
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,081
so that they can set 
examples for everybody.

410
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:44,879
They're showing others that
it's indeed safe to awaken.

411
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,383
I offer classes called
"Lessons from the Universe"

412
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:53,638
to those who have agreed in
consciousness to truly awaken.

413
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,391
As they reconnect to themselves,

414
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,353
I back them up and 
support them in that process.

415
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,108
Because those individuals will in turn
contribute to creating

416
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,654
a sense of security for others
to open up and expand.

417
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,073
This is a truly important thing.

418
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,244
What do you teach in the class?

419
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,621
Can you give me an example?

420
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:24,627
In our daily lives, we each create
our own reality, right?

421
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:30,967
For example, you manifest a situation
wherein you feel "disappointed."

422
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:37,140
But that "disappointment" is 
an Earth frequency which we can let go.

423
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,978
The frequency of our true nature
is excitement.

424
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:48,276
When you were asleep here on Earth,
just like I used to be,

425
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,697
when something positive happened,
you felt happy.

426
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,034
When it wasn't the case,
you felt disappointed.

427
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,162
Our emotions were focused on
the external reality.

428
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,708
As we awaken, we establish 
a different relationship with emotions.

429
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,710
You project your own reality

430
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,715
and experience the feeling of 
disappointment or powerlessness.

431
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,678
Those are only frequencies
and there is a way to simply remove them.

432
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:20,600
When you look at your reality
that your everyday self projects,

433
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:26,314
you can find out which frequency 
of the Earth you're using.

434
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,982
Then you remove them.

435
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,611
Would that be image training
and meditation?

436
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:36,616
There is a method for turning
those frequencies into form

437
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,162
assigning them hardness and weight,
and then removing them.

438
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:47,627
We've remained asleep by focusing
very strongly on the external reality.

439
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,047
So the outside reality seems
very tangible to us.

440
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,341
It looks like it's really happening.

441
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,803
However, awakening means

442
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:01,182
you start redirecting all that attention
on the outside back to yourself.

443
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,350
As you do this

444
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,896
your infinite consciousness
becomes much more tangible.

445
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,732
And reality starts to become "soft".

446
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,733
I agree.

447
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,780
That is how we can start using
our day-to-day reality

448
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,368
to become aware of 
the frequencies of the Earth.

449
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,745
So that you can let go of them.

450
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:27,250
There is usually a two-week period
between each class.

451
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,627
It's like a University course.

452
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,088
-A cosmic University.
-Nice.

453
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:36,217
Instead of teaching you limitations,
it teaches you how to remove them.

454
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:43,975
For my part, I've never
attended a class like that.

455
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,811
But I've studied a lot on my own

456
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,523
and received a lot of my own "downloads."

457
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,986
That's how I started to see
reality differently

458
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,780
from a broader perspective.

459
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:02,243
The best practice for you is the one
that you feel most attracted to.

460
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,663
And it's different 
depending on the circumstances.

461
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,374
For example, 
feeling drawn to a place.

462
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:13,129
If you feel like traveling to America,
there's meaning in that.

463
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,716
If you feel like staying home
that's meaningful to you too.

464
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,804
That's why choosing what brings joy
to your body and heart is important.

465
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,141
That's how you come across
information you need.

466
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,560
There's this fairy tale.

467
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,856
Are you familiar with the
story of Hansel and Gretel?

468
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:37,278
These two children leave pieces of bread
behind in the forest, creating a trail,

469
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,282
so that they don't forget
their way back home.

470
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,285
This is the analogy I like referring to.

471
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:49,832
My future self is leaving 
breadcrumbs for me, lining them up.

472
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:54,211
Guiding you to the path
leading to yourself.

473
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,548
-Animals eat them sometimes.
-Oh my!

474
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,927
But if I'm attentive, I find it again.

475
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,847
The next breadcrumb
that my future self has left me.

476
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,309
And that can be information.
Or our interview today.

477
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,896
Everything that comes up 
shows me the path.

478
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:16,776
Yes, listening to your own signs
is so important.

479
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,028
Following your excitement is 

480
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,490
always meaningful and 
leads you to new encounters.

481
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,494
The more you listen,
the stronger the signs become.

482
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:32,333
If somebody offers you advice
suggesting not to act on something,

483
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,255
instead of being swayed by it
you reflect on how YOU feel.

484
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,882
If it feels right to you

485
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,803
and brings you excitement
then clearly that's your truth.

486
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,681
Like you said, it guides you.

487
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,934
Excitement is the sign.

488
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,896
If you choose it,
you'll be on the path to your true self.

489
00:37:54,814 --> 00:38:01,529
When you listen to your true excitement
and really trust yourself in that process,

490
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:07,785
you start choosing things that feel 
right to you, and bring joy to your body.

491
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,788
In doing so, your signs become stronger.

492
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,834
Then you start to understand
the different types of excitement.

493
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,963
You'll be able to tell
if it's not right for you.

494
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,009
The true excitement contains joy,

495
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:27,388
so you won't hurt others or yourself.

496
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,683
We're experiencing a planet of separation.

497
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,103
When we see things
through the filter of separation

498
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,399
conflicts and friction result out of it.

499
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:44,113
Then we'll have the sense of
superiority and inferiority.

500
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,700
The ruler and the oppressed.
The pyramidal structure.

501
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,243
The Yakuza Mindset.

502
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,956
That's what leads up to wars.

503
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,668
But when everyone decides to return to

504
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:02,965
that vast, familiar, 
incredibly peaceful self...

505
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:10,014
When everyone remembers their true self
that is of excitement,

506
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,851
they begin to take the time
to listen to themselves.

507
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,854
They're not influenced
by the outside reality

508
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,898
but listen to their own feelings.

509
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,358
You can start with small things.

510
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,445
Things like "What do I feel like eating?"

511
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,364
Instead of saying "anything is fine"

512
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,451
you can now 
really check in with yourself.

513
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:35,498
As you make it a habit
the signs you receive become stronger.

514
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:40,294
Then you won't follow the excitement
that is not of your true nature.

515
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,378
I see.

516
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,632
Returning to my first topic,

517
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,719
you and Darryl did some events together.

518
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,764
What was the process
leading up to that point?

519
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:58,771
It started in July of 1987, when
Bashar first contacted me.

520
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:06,070
For me this was the first time
using telepathy.

521
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,657
Bashar wanted me to channel him.

522
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,202
He said, 
"The people of Earth are awakening."

523
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:18,541
"We went through a similar experience.
We wish to support you."

524
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,961
Bashar delivered this
information to you directly?

525
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,964
Yes, it was from him directly.

526
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:30,928
But I was still 
very much asleep at the time.

527
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,393
I mean, channeling 
an extraterrestrial in public?

528
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,065
It was just unconceivable 
in our deeply asleep society at the time.

529
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,693
But then Bashar said...

530
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,530
Well, at first, I was
frightened by the whole ordeal,

531
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,992
the idea of channeling him publicly.

532
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,703
So I traveled to the US,

533
00:40:55,828 --> 00:41:00,708
where I spoke with Bashar
through another channel.

534
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,961
He said 
"Are you afraid you are going to fail?"

535
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,839
I said, "That's exactly my fear."

536
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:12,261
Then he said "You have not failed
in the past, nor will you ever fail."

537
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,555
I didn't understand the meaning of it.

538
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,851
But I thought "There is no use
trying to run away from this."

539
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,480
I was starting to
become aware of my true self,

540
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,151
and I really didn't want to shut this out.

541
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:31,697
And it was then 
I was ready to lose everything.

542
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,743
Even if I lost it all, it was okay.

543
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,455
Even though you risk losing friends,
it still felt right?

544
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,042
Yes, I knew people would take
their distance.

545
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:48,464
But my conviction remained strong.
I wanted to live my true self.

546
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,133
The part that had come to life.

547
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,887
The part who hadn't learnt limitations,
my essence.

548
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,473
If that was indeed the "real me",

549
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:03,479
then I really wanted to
experience that freedom here on Earth.

550
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:09,944
This was the "truth" I kept returning to,
no matter how much fear came.

551
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,739
That's how I overcame that period.

552
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,952
From that point on
I officially started to channel,

553
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,205
appearing in public events in Japan.

554
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,041
Did that take time?

555
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,963
To get familiar with channeling,

556
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:33,509
did you have to take
lessons with Bashar?

557
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,470
-Was it easy?
-No, I wouldn't call it easy.

558
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:43,477
But when I decided to channel,
knowing I could lose everything,

559
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,563
I started speaking with Bashar
telepathically.

560
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,818
"Yes" would come from up here,
a "No" from below.

561
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:56,657
We created rules,
things to make it easy for me.

562
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,202
Also, as I mentioned earlier,

563
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:06,208
there was that "preparation phase"
where I was downloading information 24/7.

564
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,294
The pipe cleaning.

565
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,923
It really was like cleaning, I think.

566
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,801
When I was channeling Bashar,

567
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:21,974
I would put all that 
Earthly knowledge aside.

568
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:27,229
I would put aside all the laws and rules
I had learnt on Earth,

569
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:31,734
so as to become a transparent, clear pipe.

570
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,154
I decided to be 
just a clear channel to let it flow.

571
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,698
That's how I proceeded.

572
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,283
At the time...

573
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,038
We all have a Higher Self, right?

574
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,623
We just hadn't contacted it until now.

575
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:54,006
I would connect to my Higher Self
then tune into Bashar.

576
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:59,762
When you try and reach out to 
information from "higher realms",

577
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,183
whether you're trying to listen to it
or watch for it on TV,

578
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:11,065
this is facilitated by your Higher Self.

579
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:16,904
It's not just passive listening.
You're using your higher consciousness.

580
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,573
This is a great exercise.

581
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:25,287
So then, I started channeling.

582
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:31,627
No matter how far Bashar was,
on Essassani or on a spaceship,

583
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:37,758
we were in telepathic contact,
so I would receive images instantaneously.

584
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:44,348
He would send layers of information
at once like plates stacked on top

585
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,643
and I would simply "read" them
in Japanese.

586
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,813
Since my physical mind didn't interfere,

587
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,191
I was able to transmit
the information clearly.

588
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,528
So at that time,
when you put yourself aside,

589
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,823
did you step off to the side
consciously?

590
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:05,828
Or were you in a completely
different space entirely?

591
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,623
-Like in a full trance?
-Yes, everyone has a different process.

592
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,211
For me, since I was speaking with Bashar
telepathically from the beginning,

593
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:18,340
I would remain fully present
so I could hear all the information.

594
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:22,928
I see, you clearly understood
what you were saying then.

595
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,515
I was fully aware and listening,
just like the audience,

596
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,560
so I could apply the information
to my life.

597
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:33,814
That's convenient.
It'd be a waste to lose it.

598
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:40,696
You had an advantage compared to
other channels who go into full trance.

599
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:46,535
But nowadays there are fewer and fewer of 
trance channels.

600
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:52,374
Compared to previous years, 
or so I've heard.

601
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:56,545
This is only one perspective, but

602
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:02,384
without going into full trance
they couldn't receive higher information.

603
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:07,723
But now the collective consciousness
is rising and expanding.

604
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,269
So we can access higher information
without getting in the way.

605
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,272
That's what's been said.

606
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:21,737
The signal generated by people's thoughts,
which used to get in the way,

607
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,573
are now softening.

608
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,036
Yes, it's changed. It's really changed.

609
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,498
So, to go back to those
channeling years...

610
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,708
Two years.

611
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:39,004
-In the 1980's?
-Yes, it was in...

612
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,883
I started channeling publicly in 1988.

613
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,302
I met Bashar in 1987.

614
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,431
I spent two years channeling 
starting in 1988, so I stopped in

615
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,433
1990...?

616
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,605
I channeled in 1988 and 1989.
Then in 1990, I'd already quit, I think.

617
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,775
That was Bashar's wish too because

618
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:04,363
Sassanis share this information to 
support human's evolution.

619
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,449
They support us to 
not just being passive listeners

620
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,536
but integrate the information to awaken.

621
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,498
Not just being a channel,
but I reconnected with my true self.

622
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,835
I was accessing more and more of
that information to further awaken.

623
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,089
He expressed deep joy at this.

624
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:27,761
The more I reconnected with myself,
the more my consciousness expanded.

625
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:32,558
It made it easier for me to access
different states of consciousness.

626
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:39,106
I then started using this stream of
information to structure it into a class.

627
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:44,111
Collaborating with Darryl was from 2008.

628
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:49,283
Oh, that's pretty recent.
You, Darryl and Bashar.

629
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:54,663
2008, 2010 and 2011.

630
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,667
When you're with Darryl,
sharing the stage

631
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,211
what's the feeling?

632
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,131
When we are collaborating?
Let me see.

633
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,385
It's always like this,
but I'm always quite plain.

634
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,887
-Empty?
-Yes, 

635
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,599
Clear. Transparent.

636
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:19,021
When I take the next step,
I don't hold onto anything.

637
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,857
For example, when we collaborate,

638
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,861
even more so than doing it alone,
it's something of a challenge.

639
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,280
There's some concerns like,

640
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:33,535
"it's been so long since 
Bashar and I have collaborated."

641
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,581
We've done channeling and
communicated telepathically.

642
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,918
But having Darryl channeling Bashar
and me there,

643
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,003
I wondered if it'd go well.

644
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,340
But for the most part,
insecurity and fear are

645
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,426
signs for me to move forward.

646
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,554
These are opportunities for me to expand.

647
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,307
These are doors to open.

648
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,770
If there is fear and insecurities,
I use that to propel me forward.

649
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:04,441
So I exchanged fear for excitement
and did the collaboration.

650
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:09,363
With that in mind 
when we collaborated, it was like

651
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,909
the most exciting thing I could achieve.

652
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,036
It was very exciting.

653
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,664
So now, what do I say?

654
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:24,211
Bashar and I would talk back and forth.

655
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:30,384
It was a grand transmission.
It went across the stage.

656
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,094
It was so much fun.

657
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,930
I knew Bashar was having fun too.

658
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,640
I could tell.

659
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:42,938
So there was a first for Darryl
when he was channeling,

660
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,985
He stood right up while channeling,
that hadn't happened before.

661
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:52,989
Bashar was so into it,
it was a sign of excitement.

662
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,662
Oh, we see we just don't fit in again.

663
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:04,084
Around 1990 to 1991...

664
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,337
-Do you know Andrew?
-No.

665
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,965
He also channeled with Bashar.

666
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:15,804
Around 1992, 1991-ish.
Maybe for three or four years.

667
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:33,108
At that time, through Andrew,
Bashar spoke of you.

668
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,488
-Oh, really?
-From 1990, around that time.

669
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,576
He said,
there will be three entities on Earth

670
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:46,121
who will continue to channel Bashar.

671
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:50,125
Ayako, Darryl and...

672
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:55,172
Well, a number of people were
channeling Bashar.

673
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,134
But the names given, that'd be Ayako,

674
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,428
Darryl, and a dolphin.

675
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,599
-Yes! I'd heard that.
-You had?

676
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:10,604
During an public event in America
Bashar had said,

677
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:16,318
he was channeling through 
only three people.

678
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:21,823
Darryl, Ayako, and an Australian dolphin
who's name was...?

679
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,161
Dreamer. A dolphin called Dreamer.

680
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,997
What's Dreamer up to?

681
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:33,710
That's something I don't know.
I didn't have a chance to meet him.

682
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,924
What a shame. 
He should come to Enoshima and visit.

683
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,469
Dolphins generally have
a higher consciousness.

684
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,305
They have a lot of information.

685
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:50,435
-Next week I'm going to Hawaii.
-Are you going to swim with them?

686
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,605
I'll be swimming with dolphins.

687
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,191
There's an amazing vibration.

688
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:00,195
I too have swam with 50 wild dolphins.

689
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,488
A long time ago.

690
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:05,742
Even though I didn't know how to swim,
I was with them for three hours.

691
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,580
I got separated from the dock
at about 500 meters away.

692
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,916
I ended up in a deep ocean

693
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,964
because we found dolphins 
and at first followed them on a boat.

694
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:24,511
When I realized 
I was a ways off from the beach.

695
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:29,266
Hawaii's ocean was so clear,
I could see into the deep waters.

696
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,060
Freezing up in fear, I started to sink.

697
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,896
Blub, blub, blub, 
all the air came out of me.

698
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,066
I thought,
"Is this how I'm going to die?"

699
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,653
Then a dolphin's voice
cut through the ocean.

700
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,782
"Oh, dolphins!"
Excited, I saw a vision.

701
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,245
I was wearing my diving mask.
And there was a snorkel attached.

702
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,122
In this vision, I saw 

703
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:57,293
myself floating, looking down
through those goggles.

704
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,380
The dolphins were showing me that vision.

705
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:05,302
I was sinking but realized,
"That's what I need to do!"

706
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,388
I floated like the image.
That saved me.

707
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,434
These dolphins came to get me
and together we swam.

708
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,563
From both sides, two dolphins
held me between them.

709
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,231
Then we teleported.

710
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:23,653
With these two dolphins
there was a child-like excitement.

711
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,114
When I said "We're friends!"

712
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:30,410
I found myself surrounded by 
about 50 dolphins all around me.

713
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:36,708
We didn't swam into a school of dolphins.
The two suddenly changed into 50.

714
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,002
They played with me like that.

715
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,964
It was such an amazing experience
so you should try it too.

716
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:48,845
Dolphins will come to you
when you're enjoying yourself.

717
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,597
I'll have fun.

718
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,891
By laughing you draw them near.

719
00:55:54,142 --> 00:56:00,690
According to Bashar, in four years
a great many people on Earth

720
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:04,861
will come to understand
that the dream dimension is the reality.

721
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,155
When I heard that, I thought

722
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:13,036
getting there in just four years means 
the acceleration must be amazing.

723
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:18,166
Right now I'm in that dream dimension.
It IS my reality.

724
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,712
I wake up in the morning
still in that dimension.

725
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,759
Therefore I'm always in the state of 
being able to do whatever I want.

726
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:33,723
I want to tell people about it.
This is the real way of life.

727
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:39,104
As you connect to your true self
and return to that higher consciousness,

728
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,774
you'll remember that you can do anything.

729
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:47,821
With that awareness
you're moving through parallel worlds.

730
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,782
You can shift your reality freely.

731
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,368
-It's like a game.
-It sure is.

732
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:58,665
When you understand the function
and how to control it,

733
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,208
it's just a game.

734
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:04,629
You can shift to the planet
that reflects your state of consciousness

735
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,131
and experience it.

736
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:11,261
With open eyes, living in a dream.
That's the era we are headed towards.

737
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:14,389
Everyone has forgotten
that they're playing a game.

738
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,058
We're playing a game of being asleep.

739
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,145
We've gotten so involved into that game.

740
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:25,817
But we're on the verge of realizing
it's all a game so we can control it.

741
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,570
You can choose your favorable frequency.

742
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,406
Gradually, as we connect to ourselves,

743
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,659
we can zoom out and see the big picture.

744
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,163
Like the breadcrumbs
we talked about earlier.

745
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,541
If you look at a maze from above
you can see the exit.

746
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,252
So you can guide yourself.
It's the same idea.

747
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,255
When you see things from
higher perspective

748
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,842
you can guide yourself 
who is in this physical reality.

749
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,721
Like, "Don't go that way. Go left."

750
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,016
Your Higher Self can call out to you.

751
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:03,563
The other day in a class,
the Galactic Council joined us.

752
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,691
Bashar works with them.

753
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,862
-The Council is a...
-The Association of Worlds?

754
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,449
It's a collective consciousness.

755
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,868
How should I put it?

756
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,328
They're close to us.

757
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:21,831
We can become one body 
and do many things together.

758
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:26,461
We can give guidance to the people
who are asleep on Earth.

759
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:31,466
The more I connect to myself, 
the more I can see what I can do too.

760
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,760
So it's fun to work with them.

761
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,305
This conversation made me 
remember that class.

762
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:43,061
Gradually this non-physical collective 
will participate more and more.

763
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:49,192
There's a reason why many UFOs are
seen but not landing on Earth.

764
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,321
Deep sleep creates separation.

765
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,200
We're quick to fight
because we use fear.

766
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:02,872
If UFOs land and we start fighting,
they'll have no choice but to fight back.

767
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,919
They don't want to scare us,
that's why they contact from afar.

768
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:13,049
But gradually we're raising 
our frequencies.

769
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:19,347
Now finally, we can see the possibility of
joining the Council in ten years.

770
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,892
And the young ones 
will have been prepared for it.

771
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,479
So the ETs are 
waiting for us to prepare.

772
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,565
Yes, there's nothing 
they can do but wait.

773
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:35,655
We're trying our best, 
but really, we have to wait too.

774
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:40,368
For the people on Earth 
to gain elevated awareness.

775
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,788
But things have really sped up.

776
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:49,669
If things keep accelerating, by next year
the subject of UFO will be open.

777
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:54,841
In general, when I talk to people about it
it's not strange to them.

778
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,260
Yes, that's already happening.

779
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,430
But once it's disclosed,
the change accelerates.

780
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:05,935
People suspect that aliens exist.
They can accept that idea.

781
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,980
Once they know that aliens do exist,

782
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:14,110
they reject the idea because
all they've learned is separation.

783
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,864
Then everything you know collapses.

784
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,409
At the end, you'll shed 
yourself of separation

785
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,536
to return to "One."

786
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:27,707
It'll be a shock to know
that aliens exist.

787
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,168
But it's a good shock because

788
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,756
you need to let go of stereotyped ideas.

789
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:40,011
Once this happens,
things will change very fast.

790
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,763
It'll accelerate.

791
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,725
Speaking of shock,
when you first saw Bashar

792
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:50,188
the shock was brief, wasn't it?

793
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:56,903
How many days or months would it take
to recover from the shock?

794
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,655
In my case?

795
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,034
When I went to the spacecraft
and came back

796
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:09,749
I had this resolute knowing 
within myself that I wasn't dreaming.

797
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,002
So there wasn't much of a shock.

798
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:17,048
I think it's the same with everyone.

799
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,385
It's for you to think "This is the truth."

800
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,597
It's different from accepting
other people's idea of truth.

801
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,059
Once you know your own truth,

802
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,771
you'll stop doubting yourself.

803
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:36,317
Then you'll start preparing
to accept the truth.

804
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,362
Of course,
you're the protagonist of your story.

805
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:45,201
You're the one to open the gate
to let the information enter.

806
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,788
Right now on this planet called Earth

807
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:54,502
there will be more people who are ready
to accept the idea that aliens exist.

808
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,713
They'll become the majority.

809
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,258
From here on out, the changes will
create some shock,

810
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,968
the shock of the truth.

811
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:06,848
But it'll be different from the shock
that I experienced before.

812
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:15,231
Somehow, I think
the future will be extremely pleasant.

813
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:20,987
Children and awake people are
emitting that signal.

814
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,114
So there's equilibrium.

815
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,701
Without these people
there will be just shock.

816
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:31,581
Thanks to those 
who are stable and don't waver,

817
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,543
the shock will just be temporary.

818
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:42,467
Others will quickly learn from them
that there's no need to be shocked.

819
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,679
But without those awakened people,
things will be difficult.

820
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,976
We are like an antenna,
receiving signals.

821
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:56,189
And we emit signals as well.

822
01:02:56,397 --> 01:03:00,026
So, do you think 
when the time for "disclosure" comes

823
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:04,280
people won't be so shocked?

824
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,035
For those in deep sleep,
it will certainly come as a shock.

825
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,870
The extent is different.

826
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:16,876
If you don't want to see the truth,
you'll be hit the hardest.

827
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,420
But if you're starting to awaken

828
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,466
there will come a time 
where you need to choose.

829
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:29,013
You may be swaying between
being awake and staying asleep.

830
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,809
For those who are swaying like that,
this is a good shock.

831
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,062
Now they have to choose.

832
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,898
-So they choose.
-Yes, that's what happens.

833
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:43,778
-And there are those who stay...
-Deeply asleep.

834
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,907
For example, people who are into
the stock market and such.

835
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,368
The top brass, you mean.

836
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,829
Like, people who make chemicals.

837
01:03:54,038 --> 01:04:00,378
What you do for work is 
separate from this deep sleep.

838
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:06,968
This is also a chance for those
who are in deep sleep.

839
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:13,766
But disclosure may be 
a really big shock to them.

840
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,352
It might take a little time,

841
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,398
but the awakened people
will show them the way.

842
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:25,570
A wave of them will come and show others
the possibility of a bright future.

843
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:31,576
So the sleepers will be afraid, but
they'll gradually think all's well.

844
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:36,247
It's like when you're on an airplane 
and there's turbulence.

845
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,207
When it's really terrible,

846
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:42,211
everyone's scared and 
looks at the flight attendants.

847
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,882
When they see the flight attendants
staying calm, they feel safe.

848
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:51,804
Just like that,
when something out of control happens,

849
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:57,518
people will look at the ones who know
that this is the greatest thing ever.

850
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:02,857
The signal those people send out
is an invitation.

851
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:08,154
Not only that, our Galactic family are 
all supporting us.

852
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,530
There's stability.

853
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:14,035
We already have those 
awakened people and children.

854
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:18,706
Earth is ready.
That's why disclosure happens.

855
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,876
This is what I think.

856
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:27,590
The sound of truth is
different from the sound of knowledge.

857
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:32,595
You can say things just from knowledge
"The future will be good!"

858
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,764
"Don't worry! You can be free!"

859
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:39,560
But if you don't believe in it,
it's not convincing.

860
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,313
When you have the knowing,

861
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:47,193
"Our future is bright"
has the sound of truth.

862
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,320
That creates stability.

863
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,658
Returning to the conversation
about excitement,

864
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:58,454
in nature there's
nothing but excitement.

865
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:04,043
There's no overthinking.
A tree is as it is.

866
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:11,050
-In the natural world, like forests?
-Yes, and animals and such.

867
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,095
Everyone seems to be excited all the time.

868
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,766
They create and take on various forms
without thinking about it.

869
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:23,938
If it hits a barrier or a block
it redirects itself.

870
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,357
In regard to trees and grass?

871
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,109
Yes, similar to that.

872
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:32,071
But this blooms through ideas.

873
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:37,618
It thinks "I'm a lily", therefore
brings out the lilies from seeds.

874
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:42,081
Plants are not completely innocent
nor without thought.

875
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:46,794
Plants learn ideas.
There are lots of ideas in the soil.

876
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,796
Same around the Earth.

877
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:54,135
Just like cell phone signals,
there are lots of ideas around us.

878
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,222
Plants pick up those ideas.

879
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:03,227
One might pick up an idea of a tomato,
producing three fruits from one seed.

880
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,438
That's how it works.

881
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:10,693
Plants don't just bloom
without any ideas.

882
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,821
This is an Earth-based plant.

883
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:18,659
It learns ideas in the soil
and takes that shape.

884
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:26,459
When people of Earth return to the center

885
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,712
the signals will change.

886
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,006
Up until now,

887
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:39,054
we've created limitations and rules
from the idea of fear.

888
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:45,603
People have resonated in that idea
and created this planet.

889
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,690
But once people start to 
return to the center,

890
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,902
that will create 
an incredibly harmonic sound.

891
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:58,324
When you know that you're perfect
and you can be anything,

892
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,577
you'll return to unconditional love.

893
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,790
When bringing about this awareness,
our civilization will change.

894
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:11,003
Also, the Earth's frequency will change.

895
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,174
The harsh ideas will become softer.

896
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:19,470
When the idea of 
"I can be anything" appears

897
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:25,184
plants will pick up that idea and
start taking different forms, I think.

898
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,063
-That's our future.
-I agree. Thank you.

899
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:33,109
Well, our interview became
longer than expected.

900
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,735
It was fun.

901
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:40,241
-Thank you for all the good information.
-Glad to hear that.

902
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,743
When you contacted me,

903
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,621
it was perfect timing and
I was very happy.

904
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,457
Same. Thanks for letting me do this.

905
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,377
What you're doing is wonderful, Reuben.

906
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,837
Thank you.
