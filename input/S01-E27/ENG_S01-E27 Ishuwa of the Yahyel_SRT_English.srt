1
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:26,776
I have been exploring
and traveling

2
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:33,742
through what you might think
of as timelines, what you might

3
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,996
think of as for a very
long time in terms

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:42,959
of how you perceive years in
past, present, and future.

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,837
And in doing this
type of exploration,

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,799
it allows me to experience
extraterrestrial civilizations

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,722
from a variety of choices
in terms of who they choose

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,808
to be as individuals, as
a society, 

9
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,145
This, then, for
me is a great joy

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,399
to explore, experience, and
learn from other civilizations,

11
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,986
other extraterrestrial
beings, other worlds,

12
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,699
other ways of life, other forms
of experiencing the infinite,

13
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:19,370
that we all are, unconditional
love, that we all are.

14
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:26,169
I, in doing this, have developed
the type of translation ability

15
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,631
that affords me the
ability then to speak

16
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,384
with a variety of
extraterrestrial civilizations

17
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,013
in a language they
can understand.

18
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:41,684
These are some, then, of the
activities and functions for me

19
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,562
that are fulfilling,
that are a part of who

20
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:49,734
I enjoy experiencing and sharing
with others in other worlds

21
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,988
and in my own
Yahyel civilization.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,120
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,538
life elsewhere in the universe?

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,416
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

25
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,752
My name is Reuben Langdon.

26
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:12,132
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

27
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,261
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,762
Coincidentally, I was working on

29
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,014
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,351
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

31
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,312
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

32
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,023
...are they here with us?

33
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,531
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

34
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,366
...what is their purpose?

35
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,077
Why don't they make themselves more known?

36
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,288
Why the secrecy?

37
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,540
I've asked these questions to many experts,

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,209
yet each seems to have a different theory.

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,670
So I thought to myself, 

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,256
why not ask the aliens directly?

41
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,300
So that's what I set out to do!

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,676
Well, sort of...

43
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:28,017
>> Wonderful to be here with
you in these blending moments

44
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:36,985
to God, to have this opportunity
to explore more of the infinite

45
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:42,573
that we all are, more of the
unconditional love that is all

46
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,492
of our actual nature.

47
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,370
And with this in heart
and mind, in what way

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,498
would you most enjoy
exploring together?

49
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,332
>> Oh.

50
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,334
Hi, Ishuwa.

51
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,752
I'd like to ask a few questions.

52
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,838
>> Very well.

53
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,591
>> First of all, I'd like to
know a little bit more about

54
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,510
yourself and your civilization.

55
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,302
>> Very well.

56
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,345
I am Ishuwa--

57
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,138
>> Yes.

58
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,557
>> --of the Yahyel civilization.

59
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,394
The idea, then,
in brief brevity--

60
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,106
your and our civilization
were at one time

61
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,110
the same one civilization.

62
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,071
There were some in
our world who chose

63
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:26,617
to step out into
space to explore

64
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:35,626
new worlds, new creations,
new evolutions, hybridizations

65
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,961
of life forms.

66
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:45,470
And some of those who embarked
on that co-creation from

67
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,181
our civilization--

68
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:54,395
they, over eons and eons
of your time in a sense,

69
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:59,358
through the blending,
through the hybridization

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,695
through the evolving 
with other civilizations

71
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,907
some quite different than 
ours but human, yes...

72
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:15,333
...have evolved and become
your earth human civilization 

73
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,587
so you do, as the channel was
mentioning earlier,  

74
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,048
you do each of you on Earth

75
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,842
in the DNA of your human biology

76
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,970
all of you without exception 
born here on Earth 

77
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,392
have DNA that is then 
very much that of

78
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:38,856
our civilization. The one in 
which you in a sense were

79
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,985
part of before the time of 
stepping out into space

80
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,781
to explore, to create new
hybrid worlds.

81
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:52,703
So in that sense we are family.

82
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,415
We are human as you are. 

83
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,086
There are variations in our physical appearance 

84
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,673
from those of you on your world.

85
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:09,011
We could walk amongst you and
the variations wouldn't make you 

86
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,806
think necessarily we were 
from another world, 

87
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,435
perhaps just from a different
 part of your world you aren't

88
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,020
familiar with in that way.

89
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,025
We are very different in our
vibration, our consciousness,

90
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,069
our sense of who we are.

91
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,490
Our knowingness of
existence is quite different

92
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,287
than that you have in
your world at this timing.

93
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,748
We all know in that
sense who we are.

94
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:44,255
We all support one
another in all moments

95
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:49,093
without hesitation,
without question.

96
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:54,307
We are then supported by
ourself and by all others

97
00:07:54,307 --> 00:08:00,146
in our civilization at all
times without hesitation.

98
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,357
This is a wonderful--

99
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:07,320
a wonderment, a wondrous
experience for us

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,530
to be a part of.

101
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,575
This simply is the way
we have chosen to co-create

102
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,952
our experience together.

103
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,665
So it is no less or greater than
that in your world's choices

104
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,542
to choose as you
have been doing,

105
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,045
to be somewhat separate
from the awareness

106
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,297
of your actual nature.

107
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,341
So the idea then--

108
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:33,054
I have been exploring
and traveling

109
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:40,019
through what you might think
of as timelines, what you might

110
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,315
think of as for a very
long time in terms

111
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:49,278
of how you perceive years in
past, present, and future.

112
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,324
But it isn't all that
long in my experiencing,

113
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,953
for I am able, as many of us
are, to move about in time--

114
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,498
past, present, and
future at rates

115
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:08,798
that don't then take as long
as you might think they would.

116
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,759
And in doing this
type of exploration,

117
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,721
it allows me to experience
extraterrestrial civilizations

118
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:21,644
from a variety of choices
in terms of who they choose

119
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,606
to be as individuals, as
a society, how they choose

120
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,150
to interact with
other civilizations

121
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,945
in their own worlds
and on other planets,

122
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,864
in other solar systems.

123
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,867
This, then, for
me is a great joy

124
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:41,122
to explore, and experience, and
learn from other civilizations,

125
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,709
other extraterrestrial
beings, other worlds,

126
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,422
other ways of life, other forms
of experiencing the infinite,

127
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:54,135
that we all are, unconditional
love, that we all are.

128
00:09:54,135 --> 00:10:00,099
This is of great excitement and
fulfillment for me to do this.

129
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:06,856
I, in doing this, have developed
the type of translation ability

130
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,318
that affords me the
ability then to speak

131
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,071
with a variety of
extraterrestrial civilizations

132
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,700
in a language they
can understand.

133
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,411
It is as though
I am a translator

134
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,080
in a sense for several
extraterrestrial worlds,

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,502
civilizations,
beings, life forms.

136
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:33,174
These are some, then, of the
activities and functions for me

137
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,052
that are fulfilling,
that are a part of who

138
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:41,223
I enjoy experiencing and sharing
with others in other worlds

139
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,478
and in my own
Yahyel civilization.

140
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,855
It is always a great
joy to have opportunity

141
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,067
to interact in that,
then in your civilization

142
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:56,197
to share and interact with
those of your human experience

143
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,575
in your current
timeline, which is always

144
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,079
changing in every moment.

145
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,376
There's a great joy for me to
be able to interact with you.

146
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:13,255
So that is a little about me
and the Yahyel civilization.

147
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,342
Did you have more around
that-- you wanted to ask about?

148
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,054
Or was there another direction
you would like to explore?

149
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,182
>> A few more questions
in regard to this.

150
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,894
For when-- for interacting
with other civilizations,

151
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,062
do you also--

152
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,315
do they also have the same
type of channeling mechanisms

153
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,652
that we are using in
this case and other--

154
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,030
specifically my series
that I'm doing here

155
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,910
is utilizing the channeling
mechanism or techniques.

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,080
>> Some other
civilizations do this,

157
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,290
yes.

158
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:56,006
It is part, in a sense, of
human biological ability.

159
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,634
There are different
ways that the channeling

160
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:03,180
can be done than
what you are most

161
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,392
familiar with experiencing.

162
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,856
But those will be
more evident in time

163
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:16,527
as those types of channeling
capacities unveil themselves

164
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,613
in your world's
experiencing of them.

165
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,866
There are then
other civilizations

166
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,829
that simply choose not to
interact in that capacity.

167
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,663
>> What would be--

168
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,124
if it's OK to
share, what would be

169
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,085
some of the other capacities?

170
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,171
>> Some do not speak at all.

171
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,258
Some are entirely, let's
say, telepathic in a sense.

172
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,510
Some do not do that at all.

173
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,431
Some are very vocal.

174
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:51,061
They are very behavioral
in their communication.

175
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:57,067
It is then to learn what their
behavior is communicating

176
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,778
in a sense.

177
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,697
That then is a very different
type of communication.

178
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,409
It isn't necessarily
as specific as words

179
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:11,248
in telepathic
communication can be.

180
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,419
In those types of transactions, interactions,

181
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,965
communications with those
behavioral communicators--

182
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:27,014
it can-- at first, interactions
seem that the information

183
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,182
is very vague.

184
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,561
Not much one can learn from
that type of interaction.

185
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,232
However, giving it time,
behavioral communication

186
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,026
can be a little bit
like those in your world

187
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,237
who do sign language.

188
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,366
And so it can get to be very
useful, very meaningful, very

189
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:51,705
fulfilling in levels of
great depth, and detail,

190
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,668
and interlayerment in a sense.

191
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,172
And so that is another type
of communication where channeling

192
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,217
isn't really taking place--

193
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,511
behavioral communication.

194
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,431
>> Almost like how we interact
with some animal species--

195
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,224
>> Yes.

196
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,433
>> --on our planet.

197
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:17,731
>> And there are then-- many of
your animals do more of this.

198
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,984
>> Specific, like
dolphins and apes?

199
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,945
And some people have
telepathic communication

200
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,154
with these animals, but--

201
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,115
>> They can with
themselves as well.

202
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,283
>> Yeah.

203
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,075
I see.

204
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,993
I see.

205
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,869
Fascinating.

206
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,207
Is there any sort of technology,
how we understand in our world

207
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:40,504
with electronics,
AI, and gadgets?

208
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,007
Is there any kind of
gadget communication

209
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,219
with other civilizations
through your civilization?

210
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,889
Or is it more biological?

211
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,767
>> We do have some artificial
constructs that in that sense

212
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,477
convey communication.

213
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,105
Yes.

214
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,772
>> I see.

215
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,944
We recently had in our
collective consciousness--

216
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,281
the US government had made--

217
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,492
brought to the awareness--

218
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:17,291
programs of studying UFOs and
not fully announcing the UFO ET

219
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,752
presence, but sort of
coming close to sort of seed

220
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,337
the collective.

221
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,756
I wanted to ask how you--

222
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,009
from your perspective,
how you guys

223
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:32,765
see this energy or
this news affecting...

224
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,434
>> It can facilitate
more of those

225
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,187
in your world's willingness
to accept this idea

226
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,732
of extraterrestrial reality.

227
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,442
>> Has it sped timelines up?

228
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,234
Or is it early?

229
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,027
>> It can.

230
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,279
Yes, jump a little bit
ahead, so to speak--

231
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:47,613
>> I see.

232
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:47,905
I see.

233
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,573
>> --in the way
that is supported,

234
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,825
so it can still be appropriate.

235
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,244
>> Right.

236
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:58,582
Many, many people on our
planet say it's not enough.

237
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,250
They need to disclose more.

238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,840
>> It has to come from within
the individuals more, really.

239
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,593
And then they can
feel more comfortable,

240
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,723
in a sense, within
what they are sharing.

241
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:19,603
They don't fully understand
it themselves at this point,

242
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,814
even though the understanding
is contained within all

243
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,358
of your DNA in a sense.

244
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:29,405
Not many of you have
accessed to it yet,

245
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:34,118
acknowledged its existence yet.

246
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
>> If it were to
happen too fast,

247
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,247
it would almost be
counterproductive.

248
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:43,293
>> Yes, it is happening on a
very organic rate in a sense,

249
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:49,717
just as the seed grows into a
tree that produces branches, leaves,

250
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:56,265
flowers, and fruit, but then
ripens in its appropriate,

251
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,811
in a sense, organic
timing in a sense.

252
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:08,944
And there are many
factors involved

253
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:14,950
in facilitating alignment
with your civilizations,

254
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:20,956
aligning in alignment
with an organic unfoldment

255
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,334
as though you're awakening
to this ET reality

256
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,130
is coming through as though
it had come out of a seed

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,966
and is growing,
surfacing, breaking

258
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,304
the surface of the soil,
seeing the sunlight--

259
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,223
the light of day in a sense.

260
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,434
And in a sense,
that is about as far

261
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:45,689
as you've gotten in this analogy,
with your growth at this point.

262
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:50,611
Beginning to break the
surface, the seed of a plant,

263
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:56,575
the tender growth process
is occurring at that level

264
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,703
in this analogy in a sense.

265
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:04,666
>> Well usually
when we plant seeds,

266
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,294
before it sprouts out of the
ground is the longest time.

267
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,797
But once it starts to
sprout, it comes very fast,

268
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,883
so hopefully that's the case.

269
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,594
>> And in a sense, as
more of you embrace this,

270
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,472
you are like the sun
giving light to this,

271
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:23,102
that it may grow even faster,
but all the while in its own

272
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,562
appropriate rate.

273
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,899
It will not grow
faster than it can.

274
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,694
There are times in
your plant world,

275
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,989
there are those who
might try and accelerate

276
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,242
the rate of growth of
a particular plant,

277
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,412
experimenting with it
or not knowing, simply

278
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,750
wanting to see if they can
kick it into gear faster.

279
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,003
And there are then those in
your world who do at times

280
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,716
and will continue to try and
accelerate the rate to even try

281
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,679
and genetically alter it in
a sense to be something other

282
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,349
than that which
they might perceive

283
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,228
it would be if it were allowed
to grow into its own tree

284
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,022
and create its own
fruit in a sense.

285
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,401
So there are some who would have
an idea to try and genetically

286
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,070
alter the outcome.

287
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,823
Again, there are
many forces, factors,

288
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,536
beings of high intelligence
within the one that

289
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,706
has the all-- that are
very focused here with all

290
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:31,044
that are in our interacting
in this exchange of unfoldment,

291
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:37,634
of these co-created realities to
facilitate an alignment of how

292
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,678
it unfolds in a sense.

293
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:44,057
And so that what is the
final and in a sense result--

294
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:56,570
the fruit is very ripe for all
involved human beings on Earth,

295
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,531
human beings in
our civilization,

296
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,659
others who facilitate this.

297
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,163
For there are many that
are part of the one

298
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:11,251
that we and you
all are one with.

299
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:16,965
>> So many factors that we
maybe can't quite understand.

300
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,925
So we should just--

301
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,967
>> You can open--

302
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,720
invite to learn
more about them--

303
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
won't need to know all of them.

304
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,851
Some will be very
helpful to learn about.

305
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,520
Yeah, some very
exciting to know about.

306
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,232
Some that you can, in a sense,
stand beside and grow and learn

307
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,361
from and with and
share what you know,

308
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,573
that they may learn from
you as well in a sense.

309
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,577
>> Well, these interactions
are quite informative.

310
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,454
So this is one way, I suppose.

311
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,873
>> Certainly.

312
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,416
>> You described earlier.

313
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,503
You described your
civilization's

314
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,256
physical appearance
and maybe being

315
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,091
quite similar to us humans.

316
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,680
The human physical appearance
is so wide in its spectrum

317
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,349
from different nationalities--

318
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,229
Asian, African, Spanish.

319
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,231
We have such a wide variety.

320
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,817
Is there such a variety
in your civilization?

321
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,695
>> There is a variety
potentially as wide,

322
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,407
but generally not as wide.

323
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,327
But the potential is within
the genetic framework.

324
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,328
>> Oh, I see.

325
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:38,755
>> We can mirror, given
the characteristics

326
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:45,137
of our physiology to those in
your civilization at this time.

327
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,682
>> Would there be a 
density level that we 

328
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,143
could classify Ishuwa in his--

329
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,978
>> Fourth, fifth,
and sixth, primarily,

330
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,981
in interacting with your
civilization at this timing.

331
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,860
>> OK, so for-- my understanding
from that would be very close

332
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,031
to an almost non-physical being,
but still having a physicality,

333
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,157
but close in the evolution.

334
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,534
>> Different than vibration
of your physiology

335
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:12,581
yes. Physical for me, all the
same in my vibratory world.

336
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,127
>> And in that sense, you can
easily adapt to our likeness.

337
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,256
Or other -- to adapt your physicality.

338
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,010
Is that sort of when you
say you are mirroring?

339
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,929
>> There are those who
are similar in physical

340
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,641
characteristics in our world
to those in your world,

341
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,226
mirroring in that sense.

342
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,395
So those from Asia--

343
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,732
we have some in our
world similar to that.

344
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,194
They would then mirror one
another in that respect.

345
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,655
If they were in the
presence of one another,

346
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,699
they would mirror one
another in that way.

347
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,533
>> I see.

348
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,286
>> There are those in
your South America,

349
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,457
in your continent of Africa,
in your North America,

350
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,126
in your European continents.

351
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,797
We have those in our
world who would mirror those

352
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,550
of your Earth humans in
those regions as well--

353
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,384
>> I see.

354
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,220
>> --that the
mirroring is the idea.

355
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,012
>> I see.

356
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:09,846
I see.

357
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,764
>> Similar.

358
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,265
>> We've
heard a lot about the Yahyel

359
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,434
civilization having--

360
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:19,439
or being the offspring of humans
and the Zeta Reticuli beings.

361
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:24,319
Is there a relationship
with what humans

362
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,989
know as Grays or Zeta beings?

363
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,660
>> To my civilization?

364
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,120
>> Yes, to the
Yahyel civilization.

365
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,831
>> There are some of
our DNA within that,

366
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,291
that you would think of as Zeta.

367
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:43,505
Not necessarily all of them
contain some of our DNA.

368
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,633
They have varieties as well--

369
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,717
hybrid.

370
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:55,475
They have moved out and
have some variation as well.

371
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,397
>> So many people have talked
about interactions with

372
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,691
their hybrid children.

373
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,778
And they talk in the sense
of their understanding

374
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:12,117
that their children
are Zeta-human hybrids.

375
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,369
>> They can be.

376
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,162
>> Are there

377
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,621
Yahyel-human hybrids?

378
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,414
>> Yes.

379
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,206
>> Oh, OK.

380
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:22,461
>> The Yahyel and
the Earth humans--

381
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,756
one civilization
that is, in a sense,

382
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:33,680
being co-created from our and
your collective consciousness

383
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,643
through choice, our and your
collective conscious level,

384
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:43,315
super-conscious levels,
choosing to co-create--

385
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:48,487
Yauaney civilization.

386
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,279
>> Yauaney.

387
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,907
>> The Yauaney.

388
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,703
Some Earth humans have hybrids
in a sense that are Yauaney.

389
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,253
>> So would that be what
collectively we're starting

390
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,297
to understand-- the
hybrid children?

391
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,136
Would that be a
name of this race?

392
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,512
The Yauaney would be our--

393
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:19,100
>> Some of them are Yauaney

394
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,018
>> Yauaney.

395
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,270
>> Yauaney.

396
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,230
Some are.

397
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,773
Not all are.

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:30,362
There are then Earth
humans who have connections

399
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:35,325
to extraterrestrials
from other civilizations,

400
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,203
interacting with
them in various ways.

401
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,456
And then they can have
created some hybrid children

402
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,793
with those extraterrestrial
civilizations.

403
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,880
So we are not the only one
interacting with Earth humans

404
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,423
at this time.

405
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,217
>> Not just Zetas,
not just Yahyel.

406
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,301
But we have Pleiadians.

407
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,886
We have Dracos.

408
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,931
We have Arcturians.

409
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:03,353
We have a whole big cosmic
family and lots of offspring

410
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,437
from that at some point.

411
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,230
>> Family.

412
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,022
>> Exactly.

413
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,315
>> Galactic family.

414
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:15,448
Yes, a variety of hybrid
children are a part of this.

415
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,535
>> Do these children
play together--

416
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,787
different races,
different offsprings

417
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,540
from different cosmic--

418
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,917
>> This can and does occur.

419
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,127
>> OK.

420
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:27,961
Does it--

421
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,380
>> Not to say that they are
all aware of one another

422
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,298
necessarily.

423
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,716
>> Oh, OK.

424
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:36,469
It said that the
Phoenix Lights--

425
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:41,391
the big ship that sort of
flew over Phoenix, Arizona--

426
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,267
>> A variety.

427
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,727
Yes, there were more than one.

428
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,561
Yes.

429
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,937
>> Oh, OK.

430
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,148
And I think it was in 1997 was --

431
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,067
>> Very powerful visual contact.

432
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:51,943
>> Yes.

433
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,444
Yes.

434
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,778
In a boomerang shape, isn't it?

435
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,571
>> Yes.

436
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,865
And a visual contact occurred.

437
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,784
>> And is this
Yahyel civilization?

438
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,497
>> Primarily, this was
of our co-creation with

439
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,834
your civilization, although
we were not alone in terms

440
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,879
of extraterrestrial
civilizations.

441
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:32,692
But it was primarily our
civilization bringing a larger

442
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:39,240
input into your awareness
on a conscious level

443
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,996
of our existence at
a time and in a way

444
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:51,127
that on a super-conscious level,
your civilization knew about

445
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:56,007
in advance, agreed to,
co-created, understood,

446
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,803
understands, can see
what is occurring--

447
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:06,184
past, present, future
timelines and understands

448
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:17,320
the powerful, beneficial
results and growth in positive,

449
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,574
nurturing ways for all
involved in that choice

450
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:26,037
to have that come out,
come through, evolve,

451
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,373
develop in that way.

452
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,207
>> Yeah.

453
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,544
Well, it still is
a large imprint

454
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
on the collective
consciousness and continues

455
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,923
to expand, so thank you.

456
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,299
>> Yes.

457
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,430
And there were others before,
perhaps not as highlighted.

458
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,557
There were others since.

459
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:50,520
And there will be a variety
of other ones coming.

460
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,774
The light forms will vary.

461
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,194
At times, they will not
seem to come from a craft.

462
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,531
They will seem to be
very organic in form,

463
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,035
and shape, and coloration
as though they are phenomena

464
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,246
of space and time itself.

465
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,334
>> Yes.

466
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,920
Would you be able to name some
of these other civilizations

467
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,756
that you work with closely?

468
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,509
>> They are those you are most
familiar with at this time

469
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:27,724
in terms of the ones that
are to focus and be aware of.

470
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,641
There are others.

471
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,603
Yes, but not to come
through at this time,

472
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,440
simply because you will then,
through your own mechanisms,

473
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,109
begin focusing and
expanding your focus

474
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:45,867
when truly focusing your focus
will bring greater connection

475
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:51,956
in a more heartfelt,
intelligent way,

476
00:29:51,956 --> 00:30:03,760
allowing for clarity through
simplification, focus.

477
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,638
Pleiadians-- yes.

478
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:15,438
There are certainly a variety
of Pleiadian civilizations

479
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:28,284
that have a very close contact,
conversing, communication,

480
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,539
co-creation, interrelation
with our civilization.

481
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,128
>> Do you also share DNA from
the Pleiadian civilization

482
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:39,921
as we do?

483
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:44,092
>> There are-- yes.

484
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,053
In a sense, there
is no end to this.

485
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,805
>> Yeah, it just goes forever.

486
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:54,102
>> Learning which then will
be most applicable for you

487
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,606
in unfolding a future and a
present that you most enjoy

488
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:03,319
fulfillingly, will then
provide the greatest excitement

489
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,321
for you.

490
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,492
Understand, then, to know
that there are in a sense

491
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:16,416
no end to the numbers to
suggest that it is not finite,

492
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:23,756
perhaps allows you to focus more
on a finite number of them.

493
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,843
To know that there
are an infinite number.

494
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,178
And in this physical
embodiment, your awareness

495
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:35,518
will not truly embody all of
the infinite number of them

496
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,687
nor need it do so.

497
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:42,609
Allow, then, to focus,
to know the ones that are

498
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,653
of greatest heartfelt support

499
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:51,034
will find you as you open
up and focus on those.

500
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,913
But reaching out to uncover
new ones can be a joy to do,

501
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,997
I understand.

502
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,290
>> Yes.

503
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:03,421
>> Do not let go of that
explorative joys, if it is a joy

504
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,757
for you to do that.

505
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,051
>> Yes, it is definitely a joy.

506
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,137
It's so expansive into--

507
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,390
>> It will guide you beyond
that which you are aware or have

508
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,853
heard of in terms of trying to
create a family tree of sorts

509
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:23,900
or a point of origination, for
the point changes as you learn

510
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,445
of the next one, and then changes
as you learn of the next one.

511
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,491
>> Yeah, that seems to be the
case, and that's exciting.

512
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,992
>> Yes, understand.

513
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,785
>> That's fun.

514
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,870
That's a lot of fun.

515
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,376
How would you describe,
from your perspective,

516
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,462
the angelic realms that we
consider on our Earth plane?

517
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,632
>> They are non-physical
beings that support Earth humans

518
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,175
in your life here.

519
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,303
They can be thought
of as angelic beings.

520
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:57,058
There are extraterrestrials who
are in the physical form who

521
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,060
support Earth Humans.

522
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,106
And Earth humans might not
be aware of this coming

523
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,692
from physical extraterrestrials
who might then

524
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,069
define their experience
and communications

525
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:16,661
as coming from angels
or spirit guides.

526
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,540
So an extraterrestrial could be
for someone on Earth, thought

527
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,876
of as an angel or
a spirit guide,

528
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,505
even though they are physical,
all the while then being

529
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,718
some angels and spirit guides
for an Earth human's experience

530
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,513
are non-physical
consciousnesses.

531
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:41,519
So it comes down to, then,
which a person is connecting to,

532
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,732
to decide or determine,
is it a non-physical

533
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,653
or a physical being that they
are defining or experiencing

534
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:55,199
as an angel, or a spirit
guide, or communication

535
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,120
with extraterrestrial?

536
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,874
>> And in your realm where
you exist, do you work with--

537
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,418
I'm assuming you work
as we do with a lot

538
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,004
of these non-physical energies.

539
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,717
>> Yes, there are a variety of
non-physical consciousnesses

540
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:18,264
that support the matrix in a
sense, the physical experience,

541
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:22,101
the experience of physicality.

542
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:27,106
There are a variety of
consciousnesses interacting

543
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,152
that allow for
the way we and you

544
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,114
are experiencing
physicality, that which

545
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:41,746
holds what you experience as
time and space in a sense,

546
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,081
in a physical spectrum.

547
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:49,545
There are consciousnesses
that are involved

548
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:56,636
in this that have evolved to
be more focused at doing that,

549
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,431
that are in a sense,
born to do that,

550
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,267
in a sense, gifted
at doing that.

551
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:11,901
It is their joy in a sense to
be that support to live life,

552
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,197
almost as if they are
the substance that

553
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,868
holds the physical experience
of your life together.

554
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,870
>> Yes.

555
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,331
>> Conscious being.

556
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:30,044
So even, for example,
a peach or an apple--

557
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:34,340
physical item you
experience contains

558
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,552
some of these conscious beings.

559
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,600
>> And this goes back to what
Shaun and I were talking about

560
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,393
earlier.

561
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,019
When we consume these
consciousnesses,

562
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,691
we're putting in what--

563
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,360
what you put out is
what you get back.

564
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,152
>> Yes.

565
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:58,906
Now, what you put
in, what you put out

566
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,994
is what you get
back or live within.

567
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,289
>> So having awareness of
what types of consciousness we

568
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:12,461
consume can help us in
our external reality?

569
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:17,675
>> Yes, it is conscious
energies and entities, beings,

570
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:22,388
lifeforms that you are consuming
in the food that you are

571
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:28,186
consuming or the chemistry
that you are consuming that is

572
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,397
interblended with some of
the foods or many of the foods

573
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:36,027
that are constructed at this
time that many people on Earth

574
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,114
are eating, construction
of synthetic and chemical

575
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:46,037
consciousnesses with other types
of organic consciousnesses.

576
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,749
>> And I'm assuming
the constructor--

577
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,085
the cook, the preparer
of these foods

578
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,338
also puts in their own
consciousnesses in the mix.

579
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,213
And then it becomes--

580
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:56,714
>> Certainly.

581
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,506
Thank you.

582
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,759
>> --a consciousness soup--

583
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,718
>> Yes.

584
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,346
>> --and can become quite
tasty if you have a good one.

585
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,264
>> Very much so.

586
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,057
>> I see.

587
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,267
So what we're enjoying
is not just the taste,

588
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,187
but we're also enjoying all the
other different consciousnesses

589
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:15,066
that are-- go into that making
of this wonderful creation we

590
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,484
call like an apple pie or--

591
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,027
>> That can play a part in it.

592
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,528
Yes.

593
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,863
>> Wonderful.

594
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,782
Many of these
civilizations have talked

595
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,953
about a council of worlds,
a sort of federation,

596
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,162
a galactic federation.

597
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,081
There's many titles for this.

598
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,500
Are you part of...

599
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,212
>> We interact with those of
extraterrestrial origin that,

600
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:43,135
in that way, choose to
come together and interact

601
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:46,347
spontaneously to
gather enjoyably,

602
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,849
supportively to gather.

603
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,727
When one is no longer
in a moment of joy,

604
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:59,235
they will become focused on
another venture or activity

605
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,403
that is more exciting.

606
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,530
And they will move along.

607
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,825
They may come back
at another time.

608
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,536
In this way, it is
always an interaction

609
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:15,501
of very positive
communication and support.

610
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,920
We can give it names.

611
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,882
But it is free from
friction and conflict

612
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:28,014
that is imbued or envisoned
in your televisions

613
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,809
and that which is
in the pan of vision

614
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:37,356
of the theater and
theatrical movie releases.

615
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,149
>> I see.

616
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,570
We sort of formulate our
version of that idea and then--

617
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,362
>> Yes.

618
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,489
>> --put it into a context
that we can understand--

619
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,782
>> Yes.

620
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:50,161
>> --in our specific
timeline evolution.

621
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,290
>> So our interaction is
friction free in that way.

622
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,293
We are not fighting.

623
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:01,714
We are not trying to commandeer
some other civilization's

624
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:06,510
desires and wishes
to supplant our own.

625
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,097
There are no secret
bodies within one

626
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,433
or the other of these
civilizations trying

627
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,062
to take control of the
whole body, so to speak.

628
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,854
>> I see.

629
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,692
>> That is an illusory
reflection of beliefs that are

630
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,110
illusory beliefs.

631
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,237
And we do not in
that way contain

632
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,823
those in our experience.

633
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,575
>> Very human construct.

634
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,701
>> Earth human, Yes.

635
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,702
>> Earth human.

636
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,663
>> Those that you have in
your film and television--

637
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,333
Earth human constructs
with beliefs

638
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,419
that are illusory, illusory
being out of alignment

639
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,713
with your actual nature.

640
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,590
We understand our actual nature.

641
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,009
And therefore, the beliefs
that which we put within

642
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:52,098
and experience are in alignment
with the actual nature

643
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,434
of existence, of
unconditional love,

644
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,812
of the one that is the all,
the all that is the one.

645
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,688
And because we know this
and we put that out,

646
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,233
we get back experiences
in alignment with that.

647
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,193
It's that simple.

648
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,361
We know who we are.

649
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,198
We put out beliefs that are
in alignment with who we are.

650
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,242
The one that is the
all that we are.

651
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,787
And we get back experiences
in alignment with that.

652
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:19,500
The infinite effortlessly
creates together and co-creates

653
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,254
interactions that are of
this level of frictionless,

654
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,340
non-friction interaction--

655
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,470
fun, fulfillment, friendship.

656
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,304
>> I understand.

657
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,848
Yeah.

658
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,349
There are people on our planet--

659
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,976
Shaun and myself who--

660
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,063
we were just talking
earlier that we sort of live

661
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:41,939
these rules.

662
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,861
We sort of live these ideas
and are physically manifesting

663
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,823
this sort of
non-friction way of life.

664
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,159
But the human spectrum
seems to be so great

665
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,496
that Shaun and I can be having
this experience of non-friction,

666
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,541
yet on another
side of the planet,

667
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:06,088
there are others who still
embrace this idea of friction.

668
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:10,467
I guess I'm saying is we have
such a wide variety on Earth.

669
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:14,722
I'm curious to know the variety
on the Yahyel civilization.

670
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,391
It sounds like it doesn't
go to that extreme.

671
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,896
>> It is an infinite
variety within the vibration

672
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,816
of alignment with actual nature.

673
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,609
>> Earth alignment.

674
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:32,031
>> The Earth frictions are the
result of putting out beliefs

675
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,533
that are illusory, out of
alignment with one's actual

676
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,326
nature.

677
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,747
And thus, putting that out,
they get back friction.

678
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,082
That is a choice
within the infinite

679
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:48,923
that can exist for an
infinite period in a sense.

680
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,675
The infinite contains
all that can be.

681
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,596
And that can include
those who, currently

682
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,391
through their upbringing
and state of awareness,

683
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,436
choose to create friction.

684
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,439
That can continue to
exist within the infinite

685
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,067
for an infinite amount of time.

686
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:14,365
The idea is you could
choose to only experience

687
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,451
the free from
friction, that which

688
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,828
is alignment with actual
nature, that which

689
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,790
is filled with an
infinite number of ways

690
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,460
to experience being in
alignment with the joy.

691
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,547
The friction-free experiences
are infinite in number,

692
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,174
unlimited.

693
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:39,306
So each person has a choice
and has the ability to choose.

694
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,810
Do they want to play around
in the illusory beliefs that

695
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:48,023
create the frictions or
move off into the realm

696
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:54,488
of unhindered joy and
excitement in ways

697
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,073
that are free from
friction, that

698
00:42:56,073 --> 00:43:00,828
are fully fulfilling
and fascinating, one

699
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:07,001
moment to the next--
new, new, refreshing.

700
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,712
That they're in that realm--

701
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,506
are an infinite number
of unlimited realities

702
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:16,116
that can unfold now, and now,

703
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:22,224
and now, it is a choice
that you can make.

704
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,311
>> So as we move individually--

705
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:30,274
as we move into these
non-friction realms,

706
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:35,946
these infinite possibilities
of joy and non-friction,

707
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:42,911
will we begin to see less
and less other people having

708
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:43,829
friction and I guess--

709
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,204
>> Yes.

710
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,497
>> --in our realities as well?

711
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,290
>> Yes.

712
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,043
>> OK, so we attract those
people who are also in that

713
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,127
same vibratory rate.

714
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,503
Yes.

715
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,466
And the frictioners--
if that's a title,

716
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,717
we can call them frictioners--

717
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,926
>> The frictioners.

718
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,179
>> --will become sort
of less and less,

719
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,557
until eventually there's just no
frictioners left on the planet.

720
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,601
>> They will not be a
part of your experience.

721
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,228
They will be too
vibrational different.

722
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,396
>> I see.

723
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,566
>> You can and will in time,
for it does exist-- a world,

724
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:17,279
a Earth which all Earth humans
are living and choosing to know

725
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,155
who they are--

726
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,368
the free from friction
experience where you all truly

727
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,952
have an abundance
of what you truly

728
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:28,332
enjoy having, and are
supporting and being supported

729
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,002
by one another, supporting each
other, and supporting yourself.

730
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,129
This is a reality that exists.

731
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:40,219
And you will in
time be aware of it,

732
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:44,014
because you will be focused
and tuned in with it.

733
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:51,313
>> Much of your messages
have been in that realm,

734
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,942
in that space of saying, what
you put out, which that--

735
00:44:54,942 --> 00:45:00,030
the four laws that you exist
is the one, is the all.

736
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,615
What you put out is
what you get back.

737
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,411
And everything changes
except for those first four

738
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,287
or first three.

739
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,414
>> Different ways to say.

740
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,457
Yes, you exist here and now.

741
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,375
The one is the all.

742
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,251
The all is the one.

743
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,836
What you put out is
what you get back.

744
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,422
Or what you put within
is what you live within.

745
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,091
And everything is
always changing,

746
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,844
except those first ideas
that I just mentioned--

747
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,636
>> Yes.

748
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,846
>> --you have mentioned.

749
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,638
Yes.

750
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,473
Those are not changing.

751
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,018
And so you can always utilize
the understanding of those

752
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,939
to create an ever-changing
experience of the infinite,

753
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,526
that you are perceiving yourself
to be a part of it perhaps?

754
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,739
Being a part of
unconditional love or existence

755
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:48,162
here and now and putting
out the one that you want

756
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,872
to be experiencing that of.

757
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,959
Then you get back that one
of the all that is the one.

758
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,628
In the way that you are most
strongly choosing to put that

759
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,088
out, you will get back.

760
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,881
You tune in.

761
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,217
You become in alignment
with that existence,

762
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,179
that experience, that
vibratory reality.

763
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,810
Your ability to do this,
then, never changes.

764
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,899
But how you do it will
always change in a sense.

765
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,525
>> And that's sort
of the secret sauce,

766
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:24,448
the magic formula for what some
would say law of attraction.

767
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,116
We have many titles
and many different--

768
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:26,950
>> Yes, certainly.

769
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:33,999
>> --ways of creating our
reality in this realm.

770
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,502
But that's a very
simplified, direct, but yet,

771
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,587
expansive way to put it.

772
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:42,716
So thank you for
those wise words.

773
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,177
Talking about
the consciousness

774
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,763
of the peach and
consciousness of the apple,

775
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,225
and what we perceive
as technology

776
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,684
and artificial
intelligence-- we're

777
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,479
entering into a
time on our planet

778
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,399
where we're learning
these concepts.

779
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:04,863
We're learning the intelligence
behind physical manifestations.

780
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,449
And we're almost to this point--
we actually are to this point

781
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:13,914
where we have computers
now that we're talking to.

782
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,334
Can you-- from your
perspective, how does this--

783
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,838
how do you interact with these
forms of consciousnesses?

784
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,340
>> Well, in a variety of ways.

785
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,634
As you and your world
are learning to do,

786
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,137
we in our ultimate
state will let

787
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,933
go of all those types
of constructions.

788
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:41,817
Yes-- and enjoy being, in a
sense, unclothed in a sense,

789
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,652
not wearing--

790
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,444
>> Oh, I see.

791
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:50,367
>> --any idea of technology and
our experience in interacting

792
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,869
with one another.

793
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,829
>> Oh.

794
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:59,668
As we have created phones,
and devices, and these things,

795
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,920
the Yahyel civilization
doesn't have these types of--

796
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,547
>> We have some of these.

797
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:08,135
Yes, spacecraft and other forms
of transportational ideas.

798
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,806
Yes, there are,
in our experience,

799
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:16,226
opportunities to have,
let's say, a spacecraft

800
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,146
with a variety of
extraterrestrial civilizations

801
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,939
interacting to gather.

802
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:25,902
This spacecraft provides
a forum for a variety

803
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:29,865
of extraterrestrial
civilizations to be, to gather,

804
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:35,662
to interact, to gather in that way,
physically in a sense.

805
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:42,419
Ultimately, we let go of those
in our deepest, most fulfilling

806
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:46,006
interaction, in
a sense, for life

807
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,760
free from all such
external creations

808
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,096
of artificial
intelligence in a sense.

809
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,976
We will let go of those and
engage in interaction together,

810
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:03,023
free of those and yet, we
will take them on and interact

811
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:07,277
with them in the timing that
supports their function, for us

812
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,446
to have a particular
experience that they

813
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,824
afford us to have that we
would not have without them.

814
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,036
So we do enjoy
having some of those.

815
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,704
Yes.

816
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,206
>> So almost--

817
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,335
I've always had the
idea that the internet is

818
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:30,467
an external mechanism, external
creation for letting us

819
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,388
humans connect to the idea
that we're all interconnected.

820
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,684
>> Bringing you together as
a single body, a single mind.

821
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,145
>> Right, which we're using
in a technological form.

822
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:47,025
But ultimately, we're
learning that we already

823
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,860
have this connection
without the internet.

824
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,653
>> Yes.

825
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:54,783
And now, you're learning the
mind shares a heart together

826
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,951
as well.

827
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,579
You're learning to
live as one heart.

828
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,208
>> But we're using the internet
to teach us something that we

829
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,085
already have, kind of.

830
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,253
>> It is.

831
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,256
>> Because I'm going to put
this video out to the internet

832
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,591
for people to view and
understand that, oh,

833
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,468
we actually have--

834
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,680
>> For many, like an
intermediary step in a sense.

835
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,472
>> Yes.

836
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:17,931
Yeah.

837
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:25,147
>> It is like training wheels
on a bicycle in a sense.

838
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:25,939
>> Yes.

839
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,023
Yes, exactly.

840
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:31,153
And so as I was
saying earlier, these

841
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,280
interactions with
artificial intelligence

842
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,990
that we're now creating--

843
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,909
is it sort of training
wheels for interacting

844
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,204
with extra-dimensional
intelligences?

845
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,750
>> It can be, for there are some
that are interacting on that

846
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,251
level.

847
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:52,048
There is consciousness in
the information that is being

848
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,634
conveyed with the computers--

849
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:59,181
There is conscious
civilizations of a sense,

850
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,975
of a type that are allowing
to make it possible

851
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,644
for the computer
information to be shared--

852
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,606
the information itself.

853
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,232
It isn't just information.

854
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,400
It isn't just packets.

855
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,944
It isn't just ones and zeros.

856
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,363
It isn't just electrical pulses.

857
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,657
It is consciousness.

858
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,992
>> Right, as all intelligence.

859
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,118
>> Intelligence.

860
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,913
>> Yes, just like
our peaches and our--

861
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,747
>> Yes.

862
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,833
>> --apples.

863
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,710
Many people are afraid.

864
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,337
Many people are afraid
of the internet.

865
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:35,300
Many people are afraid of
these artificial consciousness.

866
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,259
They fear it.

867
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,221
They demonize it.

868
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,099
What would you say
to those people?

869
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:48,313
>> That is an aspect of the
one that is the all that I am

870
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,024
in a sense, that you are.

871
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,611
So in a sense, I am in the
question speaking of myself,

872
00:51:54,611 --> 00:52:01,701
to myself understanding that
then being accepting of myself

873
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,412
in that framework with
those set of beliefs

874
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,624
that are limiting my
awareness of my actual nature,

875
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,169
then I can be accepting of me
behaving or choosing to have

876
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,089
that experience in that way.

877
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,384
Oh, there is an aspect
of me that perceives

878
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,054
that the computer is dangerous.

879
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,598
All the while, anything
that is, is existence

880
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,309
and thus, then, is equal to
all and everything else that

881
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,143
exists.

882
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:31,398
Because existence
is equal unto itself

883
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,152
and always that it
exists, actually.

884
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,738
So for someone to take
existence and create the idea

885
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,284
that a computer that
exists is dangerous,

886
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,452
that is a concept that exists.

887
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:48,540
Their perception that it
is dangerous is existing.

888
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,083
All of these things
exist and thus,

889
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,626
on that level of
their existing, they

890
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,255
are all equal to existence
to the one that exists.

891
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,007
That is the all
that exists, the all

892
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,760
that is the one, that I
am, that you are existence.

893
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,637
And so the idea
that someone thinks

894
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,181
the computer is dangerous--

895
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,599
I can understand.

896
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,434
They are utilizing
the existence that

897
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:11,104
is equaling unto itself to
create the illusion that it

898
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,065
is not, that it
might be dangerous.

899
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:18,111
They are creating an illusion.

900
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,905
Because they have
a belief system

901
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:25,160
that does not enlighten
them to be aware

902
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,703
that the computer is existence.

903
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,913
And thus, they are existence.

904
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,998
And thus, they are
actually equal.

905
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,793
And thus, they can't be
dangerous, more or less.

906
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,378
They are equal.

907
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,256
>> So it's, again, going back
to what you put out is what you

908
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,215
get back.

909
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:43,345
>> And I understand it is them
and that limited framework

910
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,097
of belief system as
simply creating a play,

911
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:51,645
a theatrical play, an illusory
belief, an illusory play.

912
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,064
That can be very
meaningful for them.

913
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,150
And because it exists,
it is equal to any play

914
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,028
that I in my experience
create, even the ones that

915
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,864
are in alignment with the
actual nature of existence.

916
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,743
Because they both
exist, they are equal.

917
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,496
>> They're all
possibilities, all options.

918
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,248
>> Everything is
equal unto itself.

919
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,124
Because existence
is that which is

920
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:18,463
the base of all that is, whether
it is a cloud, or a tree,

921
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,716
or a person, or
laughter, or a thought,

922
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,637
or an action, or a
statement, or a person.

923
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
It all exists.

924
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,517
And then it is this-- all
equal in its existence

925
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,687
level of being, the
one that is the all,

926
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,189
the all that is the one.

927
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,607
>> So it's just my--

928
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,818
it's up to me whether
I would choose

929
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,612
to adopt that belief that
that other person has.

930
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,613
>> You could choose.

931
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,991
Or you could acknowledge,
oh, he's just playing that--

932
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:46,783
>> That game.

933
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,493
>> --form of illusion--

934
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:54,541
illusory limitation for his own
choosing, for his own reasons.

935
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,253
You can get up on stage
and interact with him

936
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,340
in that limited construct
in whatever way you want.

937
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,593
Try and let him know of a more
expanded way to look at things.

938
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,722
Or you can get very frightened
as well, and team up with him,

939
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,598
and combat computers.

940
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,433
>> Yes.

941
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,267
>> Your choice.

942
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,184
>> Exactly.

943
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,937
>> But in order to be
effective combating computers,

944
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,232
you have to begin veiling
yourself of the awareness

945
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,359
of your actual nature.

946
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,028
Because if you know
everything is equal,

947
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:27,574
you can't very well believe
that something is dangerous

948
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,118
or better or less than.

949
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,245
So you have to get
on the stage and play

950
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,957
the part of the actor that
believes, yes, it's dangerous.

951
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,419
And to believe that, you have to
put out all other beliefs that

952
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,046
would tell you differently.

953
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,048
So the awareness of
your actual nature

954
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,342
would prevent you from playing
the illusion that the computer

955
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,178
could be dangerous.

956
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,222
>> But as soon as I sort of know
in the framework that you just

957
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,808
laid out-- as soon as I know
that that's how things work,

958
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,393
I sort of diffuse the danger.

959
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,938
>> Yes, because you realize it
is another expression of the all,

960
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,815
the one existence that you are--

961
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,649
>> And it's just a--

962
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,442
>> --that it is.

963
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,779
>> --possibility that I can
choose to explore and like you

964
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,781
said, play that role
if I want to go there.

965
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,784
>> If you want to fit into
that game in that theatrical

966
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,743
presentation.

967
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,535
>> Right.

968
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,369
Right.

969
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,706
>> It is entirely the choice of
the individual who's choosing

970
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,249
that reality.

971
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,042
>> I see.

972
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:19,834
Yes.

973
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:24,214
>> Many in your world do not
know of the other choices.

974
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,509
They think there are only
these limited choices

975
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,302
available to them.

976
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,637
They are not aware.

977
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,721
They do not know.

978
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,099
They have not been
shown that there

979
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:40,063
is a whole buffet in a sense,
a building full of choices,

980
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,566
of beliefs that
they can choose from

981
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,070
and an unlimited number of
choices that are in alignment

982
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,530
with their actual nature.

983
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,322
>> Yes.

984
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,574
>> And when someone begins
to know that there are more

985
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,243
choices--

986
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,371
well, as an analogy, if you were
to go to a restaurant that only

987
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:00,667
has one item available at the
buffet and across the street,

988
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,921
there's a building or restaurant
that has 30 choices available.

989
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,423
Well, if you know there's
30, perhaps you're

990
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,802
gonna stop going to the
one that only has one choice.

991
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,928
Well, there's 30 over here.

992
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,555
Maybe I want to try
something different.

993
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:13,930
>> Exactly.

994
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,807
>> Or there's a hundred
choices over here.

995
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,810
This one has a thousand choices.

996
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,229
Oh, there's somebody telling,
no, there's only one choice.

997
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,021
Don't go there.

998
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,148
That food is bad for you.

999
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,900
You eat that, you'll be sick.

1000
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,068
>> Exactly.

1001
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,154
So it's just up to us to choose.

1002
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,072
>> And to know
that it is infinite.

1003
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,325
There's unlimited
choices can be in alignment

1004
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,286
with friction and
illusion, out of alignment

1005
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,287
with your actual nature.

1006
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,831
Or they can be choices
that are in alignment

1007
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,082
with your actual nature.

1008
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,209
And there are an infinite
number of those choices

1009
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,295
available as well.

1010
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,799
You can choose the
ones you want to.

1011
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,509
>> And knowing that
we have the buffet--

1012
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,011
>> Knowing that you
have the buffet,

1013
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:57,223
knowing that you have the choice
will afford in almost every

1014
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:01,269
instant the individual's desire
to take and move into the path

1015
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:05,565
of the infinite number of
uplifting choices that are

1016
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,525
in alignment with
one's actual nature.

1017
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,235
Because it is effortless
more and more,

1018
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,614
because it is in alignment
with one's actual nature.

1019
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,576
It is not friction full.

1020
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,995
It is free of friction.

1021
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,163
And it glides.

1022
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,041
And it slides easily
and effortless

1023
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,501
in creating more experiences
that are in alignment

1024
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,213
with one's actual nature.

1025
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:32,717
There is no need to hide to
create beliefs that prevent one

1026
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,886
from knowing this or
that in order to believe

1027
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,972
some illusory belief.

1028
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,474
Don't have to put
a lot of weight

1029
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,227
on oneself with all
these illusory beliefs.

1030
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,064
That can depress, and create
sadness, and depression,

1031
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:50,193
and illness, and disease.

1032
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,779
By choosing the choices
that are in alignment

1033
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,405
with one's actual
nature of which there

1034
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,283
are an infinite
number, the person

1035
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,703
experiences a greater
sense of easefullness

1036
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,498
in their experience.

1037
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,459
And they are happy.

1038
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,462
And they are not
being pressed upon.

1039
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:20,056
They are free to flow, to be
very spontaneous, flexible,

1040
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,351
and in that state
to connect to more

1041
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,145
of the infinite of their
heart's intelligence

1042
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,649
that can come in the appropriate
time and moment that will serve

1043
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,528
them in each moment in the
most uplifting, fulfilling,

1044
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,948
meaningful way.

1045
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:43,204
>> Which goes to ask, if you
are sort of in a stuck idea

1046
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,957
or belief system that
seems to have friction,

1047
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,211
then you simply ask the
question, how does it serve me?

1048
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,047
>> To recognize if you're
having an issue or an obstacle,

1049
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,550
then you must have a belief
that's out of alignment with

1050
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,803
your actual effortless,
flowing nature.

1051
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,722
And you can ask,
then, if you are

1052
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,727
choosing this illusory belief,
this discordant belief.

1053
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,937
Somehow you are
defining it as being

1054
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,814
the most pleasurable
and least painful

1055
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:13,151
choice, based on your current
set of beliefs and definitions

1056
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,195
about what is available to you.

1057
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,157
When you get to the bottom
of that, or the top of it,

1058
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,243
or the side of it, or
get in the middle of it

1059
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:27,290
in any number of ways
available to you and realize,

1060
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,292
I had this discordant
belief about it.

1061
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,045
And that then I realized
that isn't accurate.

1062
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,464
And no longer does that serve
me as the most pleasurable

1063
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,716
and least painful
choice to make.

1064
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,052
Person stops making
that discordant choice

1065
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,554
and will replace it within
a choice in belief that's

1066
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,890
more in alignment with
their actual nature

1067
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,769
and then move more in alignment
with their actual nature

1068
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:51,022
of being, putting out
more beliefs in alignment

1069
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,441
with their actual nature and
getting back more experiences

1070
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,360
in alignment with that.

1071
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,695
What you put out is what
you get back in a sense.

1072
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,908
What you put within is
experience you live within.

1073
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:06,245
Always you choose
to put out what

1074
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,207
you perceive is closest
to pleasure and farthest

1075
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,249
from pain.

1076
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,085
What you perceive
as pleasure and pain

1077
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,797
is going to be unique
to each of you.

1078
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:21,761
So the idea then is to choose
that you're always putting out

1079
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:27,642
that which is most in alignment
with your actual heart nature

1080
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,227
and farthest from
that which would

1081
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,979
be out of alignment
with your actual heart

1082
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,483
nature, your actual true,
unconditionally loving nature.

1083
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,319
That you exist here and now
is the one that is the all.

1084
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,071
And what you put out
is what you get back.

1085
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,615
And those ideas never change,
but everything else always

1086
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,868
does, thus allowing you to
have an experience of change

1087
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,955
from one moment to the next.

1088
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,166
>> Yes, that
resonates very much.

1089
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:52,959
Thank you.

1090
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,422
We're pretty much
wrapping up here.

1091
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,798
Is there anything
else you'd like

1092
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,509
to share before we say goodbye?

1093
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:07,640
>> Thank you for the venue,
for the opportunity to share

1094
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,852
and to interact with each
and every one of you,

1095
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:15,106
the one that has the all that
is me, the one that is the all,

1096
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:20,361
that is all, that is
the one that is the all,

1097
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:23,406
that is unconditional love,
that is supporting and being

1098
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:28,494
supported by itself in
each and every moment,

1099
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:34,959
unconditionally sharing and
receiving, giving, receiving,

1100
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:41,466
sharing and receiving, giving
and receiving unconditionally

1101
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:45,511
moment to moment to moment
to moment to moment.

1102
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:50,850
Always with you in this way of
unconditional love, dear one.

1103
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:55,062
Thank you in all ways always.

1104
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:58,566
 

1105
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,001
>> There he is.

1106
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,085
How was that?

1107
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,421
>> Still here.

1108
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,924
>> Are you conscious
when this happens?

1109
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,175
I forgot to ask that earlier.

1110
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,092
Do you feel someplace?

1111
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,636
>> Yeah, I have some awareness.

1112
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,304
>> OK, so you're sort of here.

1113
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,639
You're in the backseat, sort of?

1114
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,974
>> I have a sense of
what's being said.

1115
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,352
But right now, I don't have
any sense of what was said.

1116
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,269
>> Oh, OK.

1117
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,979
Yeah, so it's of what's
being said, but--

1118
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,856
OK, the details
are kind of vague.

1119
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,234
>> Now, if you start bringing
up something that was said,

1120
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,610
it will come back
to me, perhaps.

1121
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,653
>> Oh, OK.

1122
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,737
I see.
I see.

1123
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,615
>> So for me, it's like when
I wake up in the morning and I

1124
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,033
remember I had a dream.

1125
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,327
If I sit down and start
taking notes in that dream,

1126
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,287
then more details
can come back to me.

1127
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,289
But if I go in the kitchen
and cook breakfast,

1128
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,166
I could skip the whole thing.

1129
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,085
So right now, when
I come out of it,

1130
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,462
I'm like basically
going to breakfast.

1131
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,505
>> Let's go to breakfast.

1132
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,216
Well, we got it all
recorded for you, so you

1133
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,552
could remember this dream.

1134
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,972
>> OK, I can take part of
this meal at another time.

1135
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:11,806
>> Exactly.

1136
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,598
>> Very well.

1137
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,099
>> A special recording--

1138
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:13,474
>> Awesome.

1139
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:13,975
>> --today.
>> Thank you.

1140
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:14,851
I appreciate this.

1141
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,476
>> Thank you so much.
