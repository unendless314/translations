1
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:19,352
You are all naturally wired 
for growth and spiritual expansion.  

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:24,566
The expansion is accelerated by the ongoing
  invitation from the level of the higher self 

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:29,654
to look beyond that which is already 
known by the person and mind. 

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:36,619
And so, you will from time to time surprise
 yourselves by manifesting certain circumstances 

5
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,248
that tickle the current understanding of the self, 

6
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,960
and nudge it into a broader, wider perspective.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,968
The more you sense yourself, feeling either triggered 
or intrigued by the information delivered to you, 

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,889
the more you are signally to yourself the relevancy of it, 

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,809
 as a usable stepping stone in your personal storyline.  

10
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:08,359
Where this relevancy lies is in the finding of your own 
personal truth regarding the information given to you, 

11
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:15,033
or whether it lies in the facing of certain fear-
based beliefs so you will be able to transform them.  

12
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:21,414
You all play this game, both on 
an individual as well as collective scale.  

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,294
Now when it comes to open contact with the ETs, with multi-dimensionals, 

14
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:31,007
with those aspects of you that you have chosen to temporarily forget, 

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:35,220
to serve you on your journey of remembering on the Earth stage.  

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,932
We understand that for many, and for a long time, 

17
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,270
there may seem to have been hardly 
anything more ‘out there’ than this particular idea, 

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,609
and yet you have shown yourselves
 in over a thousand ways along this journey, 

19
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,655
that deep within, you all know and never truly 

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,576
have forgotten your connection to the stars or to your greater selves.  

21
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,746
This type of contact, it is within you already.

22
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:06,292
It has been depicted in cave paintings and ancient artifacts.  

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,422
 It has been reflected back to you 
by those ancient and modern channelers 

24
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:17,178
you know usually refer to as artists, 
by their paintings, music, books and films,

25
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,890
lyrics from songs and poetry throughout the ages. 

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,686
And this type of contact, though not always shared with the public,

27
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:30,733
already has shown up in many 
astronomical and army based observations 

28
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,321
and even is represented within your own DNA 

29
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,200
 and let us tell you there is no ‘junk’ in there.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,787
It is all pure and infinite potential, 

31
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:49,127
and once embraced it will come to 
feel like a logical part of a much greater puzzle, 

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:54,090
that, once you speak it’s language,
the language of your hearts, 

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,218
you will continue to explore within your own evolution 

34
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:02,181
as we are too exploring the infinite amount of wondrous ways 

35
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:09,606
wherein All That Is expresses itself by meeting and greeting you.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,820
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,238
life elsewhere in the universe?

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,117
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

39
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,453
My name is Reuben Langdon.

40
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,832
And on March 29th 2007 in the middle of the day,

41
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,961
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,463
Coincidentally, I was working on

43
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,715
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

44
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,052
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,013
To find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

46
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,724
...are they here with us?

47
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,231
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

48
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,067
...what is their purpose?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,778
Why don't they make themselves more known?

50
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,988
Why the secrecy?

51
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,241
I've asked these questions to many experts,

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,910
yet each seems to have a different theory.

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,371
So I thought to myself, 

54
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,957
why not ask the aliens directly?

55
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,000
So that's what I set out to do!

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,377
Well, sort of...

57
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,891
>> So here we are
in lovely Sedona.

58
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,935
Amazing property here.

59
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,022
Thank you to Dana for
letting us use his place.

60
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,981
>> Gorgeous.

61
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,570
>> And thank you for showing
up in this awesome vortex spot

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,992
of crazy interdimensional
cosmic high-wave energy.

63
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,784
>> Perfectly put.

64
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,577
And you too.

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,536
>> Yes.

66
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,371
Well, I can't get enough
of this place.

67
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,374
So any opportunity to come--

68
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:39,589
and I'm glad our timelines
merged, pathways merged.

69
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,469
To meet at this spot in this land, 
its such a sacred area.

70
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,721
You are from the Netherlands?

71
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,513
>> Yes.

72
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:52,685
>> And you're here in America
doing traveling and doing

73
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,519
your work.

74
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,437
>> Following my heart.

75
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,438
>> Following your heart.

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,607
So tell us a little
bit about that.

77
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,736
What is your work, your
play, your what you're doing?

78
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,197
And how does it all start?

79
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,783
>> Wow, OK.

80
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,454
So right now, I'm traveling
as an interstellar channel.

81
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,040
I do group Q&As with people.

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,043
And I'm channeling
my interstellar guide

83
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,338
Arjun, who is of the
Yahyel, as I understand it.

84
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,130
>> Mm-hmm.

85
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,093
>> And I also do private
sessions, one-on-ones,

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,262
that are a little bit different
than the groups because it goes

87
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,097
really in-depth.

88
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,933
And receiver is laying down.

89
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,269
And it's mixed between
energy work, Q&A

90
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,938
because there is
definitely dialogue.

91
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,109
And it accelerates
and streamlines

92
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,821
the self-healing properties of
the body if the receiver can

93
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,408
match the frequencies that I
could say the ETs are offering.

94
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,660
Arjun works with a team.

95
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,413
So it's never boring, or
it's never just one guide.

96
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,166
But he's my hub,
as I understand it,

97
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,836
and he translates
information through me.

98
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,172
I allow that to flow through
and share it with other people

99
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,008
because I'm basically
in love with this work

100
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,385
and with their energies.

101
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,139
And everything started
to come together

102
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,603
for me into this kind of work
about 2 and 1/2 years ago.

103
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,729
>> Fairly recent then.

104
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,772
>> That is fairly recent.

105
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,608
Actually, stepping forward with
the vocal channeling, I mean.

106
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,736
And years before that,
I was writing it down.

107
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,072
But I've been receiving
downloads of information

108
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,741
and having visitation
experiences

109
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,579
and physical experiences with
what I believe or understand

110
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,915
to be the interstellar
family members since I

111
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,001
was a child, since age 3.

112
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,461
So for me, it was
quite a journey

113
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,463
to understand what was going on.

114
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:48,176
And in Europe, I guess,
it's less common.

115
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,345
>> Is it?

116
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,722
The idea of contact and--

117
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,266
>> Yeah, it's not
spoken of that much.

118
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,851
Or at least it wasn't
in my childhood.

119
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,103
>> --abduction, temporary
detainment, all of these.

120
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,313
>> Exactly, yeah.

121
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:06,068
That was totally
unknown phenomena to me

122
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,572
until maybe at age 26, I
started hearing about that.

123
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:14,368
And I was like, oh,
wow, how about that?

124
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,704
>> So you had
personal experiences,

125
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,164
but you didn't really
think about that?

126
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,248
>> Yes, I did.

127
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,211
I realized that it
seemed to be just me.

128
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,422
>> You thought it was
just you until 26.

129
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,801
>> Yeah, and it was eye-opening
for me because, wow.

130
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:36,641
I just thought something wasn't
all together right maybe.

131
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,351
I knew it wasn't ghosts.

132
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,062
I knew it was other than
people that have deceased.

133
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,856
And of course, you
can channel that too.

134
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,234
So I knew that wasn't it,
but I couldn't pinpoint it

135
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,109
because of that.

136
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,486
I wasn't into sci-fi.

137
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,697
Because all films
with shooting in it,

138
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,824
I was super sensitive
to all of that.

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,705
So for a long time, I was just--

140
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,166
well, I learned how to
embrace it within myself,

141
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,043
so I found a way with it.

142
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,712
But I kept it to myself
for a very, very long time

143
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,965
and used the
information for myself.

144
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,926
Already as a child,
I had experiences.

145
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,178
I knew I was going
somewhere else in the night

146
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,846
and being brought back.

147
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,682
And I learned lessons.

148
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,561
And I could embrace
them so easily.

149
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,440
And the conviction of it was so
strong, it was so heart-based.

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,693
What just confused
me at the time

151
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,320
was that my teachers
in school were teaching

152
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,865
totally different things.

153
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,909
>> The teachers
of like regular--

154
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,452
>> The normal primary school.

155
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,871
>> Primary school, right.

156
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,914
>> So that was confusing.

157
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,833
>> Different things in
the sense of history?

158
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,669
Or what kind of
things were different?

159
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:52,341
>> History, but also
definitely the way--

160
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,011
I as a child was being
taught how you will

161
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,054
grow up and go into society.

162
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,222
It was very much--

163
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,015
>> Structured.

164
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,849
>> Yeah.

165
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,143
>> And this way, you're going
to be a lawyer, a doctor.

166
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:02,935
>> Yeah.

167
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,146
You study something, you
become that one thing.

168
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,105
>> Go to college.

169
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,606
>> You choose a profession.

170
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,150
You need to know
what you want to be.

171
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,444
It was very strict
in that sense.

172
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,822
>> And the messages you were
getting were not of that sense?

173
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:21,329
>> Follow your heart, do what
you feel fits your core energy.

174
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,081
And that is much more intuitive
than the professions that

175
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,000
are usually offered to you.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,835
So very young, I
decided I wanted

177
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,921
to do something with art
because drawing was my language.

178
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,131
I wasn't speaking.

179
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:37,428
There was a part that I was
a really quiet kid, which

180
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,264
most people probably wouldn't
expect when they meet me now.

181
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,141
>> And all the teachers
were probably saying,

182
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,602
this is just a hobby, you
can't make money at this,

183
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,519
you can't do anything.

184
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,312
>> Yes.

185
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,522
You're not raised to
believe-- like the societies

186
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,151
or artists, bohemian lifestyle,
where is this ever going to go?

187
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,489
And isn't it time for
something more serious?

188
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,951
So that never worked for me.

189
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,995
So I knew that very young.

190
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,581
In school, there were lessons
coming from a teacher.

191
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,415
And I'm like, no.

192
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,042
And I didn't know
why I understood

193
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,169
that that wasn't the way.

194
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,130
But that became more clear
throughout my puberty.

195
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,591
The visitations
became more intense.

196
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,677
There was definitely a
time that I resisted it.

197
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,847
I thought this is
getting too crazy,

198
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,932
I don't want this anymore.

199
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,475
I was living a double life.

200
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,393
>> Mm-hmm.

201
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,268
>> But that was all--

202
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,979
I can see now when I
look in retrospect,

203
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,233
that was all because I didn't
understand what was going on.

204
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:37,154
And then at age 24, I
actually sought help.

205
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,197
>> Like medical help?

206
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:38,989
>> Yeah.

207
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,659
I thought I needed to
speak at least to someone

208
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,412
that I feel safe speaking to
and sharing this story because I

209
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,123
was keeping it in for so long.

210
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,582
But then I was in art school.

211
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,460
So art was a beautiful
and natural outlet for me

212
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,509
to share or to process more what
was going on in my life before.

213
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,887
And then I went to see a--

214
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,515
I think you call it
a psychotherapist.

215
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,101
>> Psychiatrist,
psychotherapist.

216
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,935
That works too.

217
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,730
>> The most easy one
that they send you to.

218
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,524
And he appeared to be
an ex-hypnotherapist.

219
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,359
Which was great because
he could really feel

220
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,945
into my story very intuitively.

221
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,822
So we understood each other.

222
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,616
And he just reflected to me
exactly what I needed to know.

223
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,996
And he said, you can
work with these "dreams,"

224
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,205
that is not the enemy.

225
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,457
It's you speaking to you.

226
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,584
And then it clicked so quickly.

227
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,255
I only needed just a few
conversations with him

228
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:41,510
to grasp it and suddenly be
like, oh, OK, this is it.

229
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,265
And only a few months after
that, I saw my first UFO.

230
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,809
And then everything
started accelerating.

231
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:54,982
>> Once you sort of accepted
it, then that created the space

232
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,275
and the pathways.

233
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,069
The pipes were free to--

234
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,739
>> Through which more
information could come without

235
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,616
freaking me out.

236
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:09,413
>> So it's really the freak
factor that sort of kept those

237
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,332
doors semi-closed?

238
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,251
>> I was super shy
and, as a child,

239
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,420
afraid of judgments
from outside.

240
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,507
I was raised Christian,
so this is super

241
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,343
leaning towards the
unexplainable, you know,

242
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:27,223
what from the Christian
side is just evil.

243
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,974
So I kept it to myself.

244
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,935
I knew it was good, I
knew it wasn't evil.

245
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,729
But I knew it was
other, and people

246
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,939
might respond to it that way.

247
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:41,111
>> Yeah, and you didn't want to
be demonized as some people who

248
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,321
do come out with this.

249
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:42,696
>> Yeah.

250
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,657
And it must have been
much harder in the past.

251
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,326
I mean, this is
heaven right now.

252
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,662
I mean, what you're doing,
you're interviewing--

253
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,454
>> Yeah.

254
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:56,001
We're having a conversation
about ETs and talking to them.

255
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,294
It's not a big deal.

256
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,128
>> Yeah.

257
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,755
Coming home, that's
what it is to me.

258
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,883
Because I'm like, oh, man,
now I'm surrendering to it.

259
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,719
I'm really going with the flow.

260
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,304
>> Very cool.

261
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:13,102
And so tell us a
little bit about Arjun,

262
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:20,442
the Yahyel, your understanding
of that alien race, society.

263
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,989
What kind of messages are
you getting in that sense?

264
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,660
>> So I understand
he's of a hybrid race.

265
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,912
They exist out of--

266
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,957
that sounds so technical.

267
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:39,253
They are result of the
future human race--

268
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,215
one future human
race, one timeline--

269
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,218
that found themselves eventually
at a dead end, you could say.

270
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,557
>> The Zetas, essentially.

271
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,349
The Zeta story.

272
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,142
>> Yes.

273
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,476
>> So we've covered this story.

274
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,729
>> OK, great, so
I don't have to.

275
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,563
OK, great.

276
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,940
So that's technically
what I understand

277
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,776
the Yahyel are-- the last,
the youngest race that

278
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,239
came out of that experiment.

279
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,827
They're very much
like us physically.

280
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,873
And Arjun looks-- he's a
little taller than I am.

281
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,832
He's blond.

282
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,668
He has a slight curl,
he has blue eyes.

283
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,506
First, I thought he was a
Pleiadian because of the look.

284
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,342
>> Yeah, we sort of have
this classification,

285
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,010
I've always wondered
this, maybe I'll

286
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,219
ask Arjun this later.

287
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:34,516
We have this idea of
Pleiadians being this way.

288
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,560
And then I've talked to
other Pleiadian channels,

289
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,437
and they're like, oh,
no, we have Cat people,

290
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,773
we have all these different--
there's many types.

291
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,651
>> Yes, I was also just going
by the pictures in the books,

292
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:43,984
I guess.

293
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,070
So I was thinking, oh,
this must be the Pleiadian.

294
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,113
Because he was so light.

295
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,325
>> And it's also, I
think an energy.

296
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,579
Did he ever say
there is other races?

297
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:02,795
Do we have black or
Hispanic-looking Yahyel beings?

298
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
>> They have colors.

299
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,965
>> They have different colors
and different hair color.

300
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,757
>> Yeah.

301
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,591
>> All right.

302
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,219
Again, we can go into that
later with those guys.

303
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:15,391
>> But he's known
me my whole life.

304
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:22,398
We made a pre-my birth agreement
to do this if I wanted to.

305
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,443
So this is always a
free choice agreement.

306
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,948
I decided to do it, to
test it out, in a sense.

307
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,866
So I did art school,
I was an artist first.

308
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,536
And then I became a
life coach, overcoming

309
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
my fear of working with
people, in a sense,

310
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,124
and really wanting to share
the heart's message that

311
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,376
was already kicking in there.

312
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,254
And from a life coach, I
went to this channeling work,

313
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,632
which basically took the life
coaching over in a few months,

314
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,800
very quickly.

315
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,301
And I started to
come out with that.

316
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,554
>> So you're sort of life
coaching through the channeling

317
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,346
work.

318
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,222
>> In a sense, yes.

319
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:55,681
>> You are guiding people.

320
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,933
>> It's the same mission, if
you want to look at it that way.

321
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,226
>> Just helping people
along with their stuff.

322
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,060
>> Yeah.

323
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,272
And I just have a lot
of assistance now.

324
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:08,569
And Arjun works with a
big bunch of other races.

325
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,904
So there's kind of a
steady healing team

326
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:15,075
present when I do the
groups or private sessions.

327
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:19,121
>> Have you had direct
communication with those guys?

328
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:19,955
>> Yes.

329
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,500
Actually, one I know
from since I was a child.

330
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,711
He's a Mantid being.

331
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,464
He's one of the three in
this study team, I call it.

332
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,631
>> Three Mantis beings?

333
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,424
>> No, no.

334
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,717
There's three beings--

335
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,012
Sirius, Mantid, and Sassani.

336
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,181
And these three work with
Arjun, who is Yahyel.

337
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,142
So they work together
a lot, I understand.

338
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,480
It's much more flexible and
interwoven-- is that a word?--

339
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,272
>> Yeah.

340
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,526
>> --than maybe you would think
when you just dive into this.

341
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,613
They're not super
separated races.

342
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,449
They do a lot of stuff together.

343
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,620
>> And the Mantid being, is he--

344
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,165
>> I remember him from
visitations in my childhood.

345
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,046
Arjun is my hub, so we are
really, really close, also

346
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,006
even genetically somehow.

347
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,219
Throughout my family line, with
the DNA, there is a connection.

348
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:21,183
And that's why it's easiest
to have this one study guide

349
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,311
and translate the
other ones to me.

350
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,104
>> I see.

351
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,355
So it's with Rob Gauthier.

352
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,150
He uses TReb to access all
these other different beings.

353
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,984
>> As his hub, yeah.

354
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,111
>> As his hub.

355
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,946
And we joke about it.

356
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,072
He goes fishing with TReb.

357
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,617
And in that process, all these
other beings can come through.

358
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,621
And he's sort of
oblivious to it.

359
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,332
But he has many beings coming
through him all the time.

360
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:45,541
>> Yeah.

361
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,959
So all I see,
basically-- well, I

362
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,752
do get the images
of the other beings

363
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,256
if there's a cross-connection
going on like that.

364
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,049
But if I have a question
in the background,

365
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,843
I can actually have
a Q&A with a person

366
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,263
or facilitate the Q&A between
Arjun and the questioner

367
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,265
and have a question of
myself in the background.

368
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,766
And in my mind--

369
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,185
maybe it sounds weird-- but
I'd turn my head to the right.

370
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,311
He's always on the right side.

371
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,104
>> Arjun.

372
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,146
>> Yeah.

373
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,606
And I will see his expression.

374
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,152
And he can actually answer
my questions in the back.

375
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,028
And my attention
goes to the left.

376
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,155
There's this--

377
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,198
>> Left-right.

378
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,909
>> Yeah, movement always
happening when I go

379
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,910
into channeling as well.

380
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,453
I kind of fall to the
left, and then Arjun

381
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,329
comes from the right.

382
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,498
>> Does the Mantoid
being have a name?

383
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,291
>> No.

384
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,208
>> He's just Mantoid guy.

385
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,001
>> Yeah.

386
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,086
And I haven't asked
for a name either.

387
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,130
I did ask Arjun for
a name at some point

388
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,425
because we didn't use a name
either in the beginning.

389
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:42,264
So for months, it was just
my Yahyel guide or parallel

390
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,850
version of myself, because he
is a future version of me.

391
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,355
I didn't really ask
for names in the team.

392
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:55,027
Although the Sassani is a
female, and her name is Nanuk.

393
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,861
>> Nanuk.

394
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,653
>> Yeah.

395
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,698
And I got that name while I was
painting her face, because I'm

396
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,950
painting my team at the moment.

397
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,911
And I want to have
portraits of them,

398
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,329
and I'm working on that now.

399
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,789
And it's fascinating
because I get

400
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,958
to see in my head
what they look like.

401
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,919
But then maybe sometimes
they want to dress up,

402
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,045
they want to look
a little different.

403
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,422
That they let me know, OK,
just add this and this symbol

404
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,884
because that's the theme
I'm representing for you

405
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,094
or for a client, for instance.

406
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,056
So art is still a big part
of my work in a sense.

407
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,474
It's very visual.

408
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:31,605
>> Can you describe the Sirian
and the Sassani being at all?

409
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,941
>> So when I was
painting Nanuk's face--

410
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,693
she's the Sassani being--

411
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,989
she inspired me, you could
say, to put a sun and a moon

412
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,366
on her forehead.

413
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,285
And later, I got a
dream that explained

414
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,747
how she was about balancing
energies, male and female.

415
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:54,503
And that's part of her
role in the healing team.

416
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,547
And she's really
connected to nature.

417
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:03,178
So they all have their own
little niche, something

418
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346
that they're really good at.

419
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:09,268
And the Mantid being is really
amazing with bone structures,

420
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:15,482
skeleton, the doctor's kind
of work, realigning the more

421
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,235
tough stuff, in a sense.

422
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,405
And I don't know another
translation for it,

423
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,324
but electro currents-- he's
really strong with that.

424
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,409
>> Electromagnetics?

425
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,493
>> Yeah, in the body.

426
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,704
And he works on the
brain very strongly.

427
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,543
We have a particular
thing going on.

428
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,044
He was there since
I was a child,

429
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,673
and we did a lot of
frequency matching.

430
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,508
So I understand how he works.

431
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:45,345
And he's part of the
energy, you could say,

432
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,265
that moves my hands when
I do a healing session.

433
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,352
The movements that
go with the healing

434
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,689
amplify the work that is
being done on an astral level

435
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,774
because they use my energy body.

436
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,235
So in a sense, they wouldn't
necessarily need my body.

437
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:05,949
But because we are physical,
I'm like the portal, in a sense,

438
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,493
physicalizing the movements
here, getting even closer

439
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,538
to the other person.

440
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,040
>> Yeah, movement is so huge.

441
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,666
>> Yeah, it's really big.

442
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,796
>> And moving energy, we
don't necessarily do that.

443
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,299
But just in this
motion of the hands--

444
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,091
>> It's really big.

445
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,970
>> Especially martial artists
really understand this with

446
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,846
energy work.

447
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,515
Chi Gong, Tai Chi,
Kung Fu, all of

448
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,518
these different
physical movements

449
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,479
actually move energetics.

450
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,396
>> Yes, exactly.

451
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,481
>> Create the space.

452
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,776
>> And that can
come very precise.

453
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,528
And I love to work
with them in that way.

454
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,573
And the Sirian being is--

455
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,325
this is really hard
to put in words.

456
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,204
It's really the bigger
electromagnetic field,

457
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,500
boosting it with light and
rebalancing in that way.

458
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,044
Everything has a level
around you in a sense.

459
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,462
I do sometimes
work with my hands

460
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,006
up very high and
sometimes much closer.

461
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,885
And the being that fits in with
that part of the energy body

462
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,845
will assist.

463
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:13,392
Eventually, everything is,
of course, one and connected.

464
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,102
But they do really
know how to streamline

465
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,354
certain parts in the system.

466
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,524
And when there's a group
Q&A, they're there,

467
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,776
and they work in the back
for those who from the heart

468
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,987
wish some assistance on
maybe whatever kind of topic

469
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,780
is with them.

470
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,490
>> And they speak through Arjun.

471
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,282
>> Yeah,

472
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,867
there's information
coming through.

473
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,954
>> So did they ever come forward
and say, hi, I'm Mantis guy?

474
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,455
>> No, not their role.

475
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,623
Very clearly not their role.

476
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,419
>> So it's really just
communicating through Arjun,

477
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,211
through you.

478
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,589
>> Adding to the information for
the questioner to get a clearer

479
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,844
picture of what their higher
mind wants to come through

480
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,137
to their conscious minds.

481
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:54,474
Because that's their common
goal-- to reflect to anybody

482
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,434
their own inner
rhythm, in a sense.

483
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,353
They're just putting it
into words, the things

484
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:05,068
that we with our rational
mind don't focus on

485
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,361
that much, I guess.

486
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,488
Because we can, but
we weren't taught to.

487
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,491
So it's still, for most
people, blind spots.

488
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,701
And for me as well sometimes.

489
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,413
I really need some
good reflections.

490
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,083
>> And the work you do
with the energy healing--

491
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,669
and you did a session
for me yesterday--

492
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:30,635
that work, using
your cosmic clan

493
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:37,642
to communicate with my
cosmic clan and then help

494
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,477
reflect that.

495
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,311
That's sort of how--

496
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,103
>> Yeah.

497
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:45,525
It's all coming together and
coming out as one storyline,

498
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,486
the information
that's coming through.

499
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,156
>> And it's not necessarily your
cosmic clan saying this per se.

500
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,284
It's just that they
are maybe better

501
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,496
communicators to my cosmic clan.

502
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,290
And they can say,
OK, his cosmic clan

503
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,293
is saying this, so do this.

504
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,085
>> Exactly.

505
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,297
So it's not that they're--

506
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:11,301
we have this idea of
how psychics work.

507
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,386
And they can read our minds
and go into this stuff

508
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,179
and do other stuff.

509
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,723
But in reality, what's
probably really happening

510
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,558
is just my cosmic
guides are communicating

511
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,185
with your cosmic guides.

512
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,980
And then you just have a clearer
channel to your cosmic team

513
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,315
than I do.

514
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,608
>> Ah, I don't know.

515
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:31,613
>> I mean, I would say you do
because you're able to have

516
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,949
those dialogues in
the work you're doing.

517
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,158
>> I think everybody can.

518
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,326
>> I think everybody can too.

519
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,162
>> But of course, I
will say it's both.

520
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:44,876
Because some people need a
little bit more training back,

521
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,795
which is really what I
would want to call it--

522
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,631
training back into that
actually natural state.

523
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,176
Because that's our nature
to have that very open.

524
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:57,430
>> And the whole idea of
shamanism and shamanic

525
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,809
practices with our
native cultures,

526
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,229
that's sort of what they, from
my understanding training with

527
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,188
them--

528
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:09,442
when someone would go
to visit the shaman,

529
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,486
in essence, they're
doing the same thing.

530
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,279
[WIND CHIMES RING]

531
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,491
The shaman is connecting to
the other person's guides.

532
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,743
And the guides are telling
them to do this work.

533
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,577
>> Yes.

534
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:25,792
>> As opposed to, I'm doing this
work because I'm psychic and I

535
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,626
know better.

536
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,627
It's not that at all.

537
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,920
>> I even don't like that.

538
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,133
I avoid even the word
"healer" on my website,

539
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,218
for instance, because
I'm just a facilitator.

540
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,469
I'm letting stuff through.

541
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,971
I never know what's
going to happen.

542
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,641
I don't have a preset idea
about what somebody would

543
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,518
need because I don't know that.

544
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,562
That other person
actually knows best.

545
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:50,275
So all that is being
asked for in that moment

546
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,027
and being allowed
in is a reflection

547
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,070
of their own inner wisdom.

548
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:59,075
>> And I think as we define and
understand these terms better,

549
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,621
we can tell this
story now in this way.

550
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,998
I think maybe before,
we didn't have

551
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,960
the understanding,
or the knowledge

552
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,211
to go that deep into it.

553
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,589
So we just said, yeah, I'm a
healer, and I'm healing you.

554
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,341
And then we go, yeah,
you're healing me.

555
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,177
But in reality, nobody's
healing anybody else.

556
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,803
>> It's all self-healing
eventually.

557
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,180
>> Eventually,
it's self-healing.

558
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,139
And so I'm just giving--

559
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,474
it's the permission slip thing--

560
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,893
I'm giving you permission to...

561
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,313
it's tricking myself in essence.

562
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,815
I'm like, I'm doing
the healing work.

563
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,026
But just because of
the way my mind works

564
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,989
and the construct
of my reality....

565
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:45,121
I need this physicalized, outside
thing to do the healing.

566
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:51,336
>> But that still takes away
a little bit of the idea of--

567
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,589
you used the word "need"
in this description.

568
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,675
>> Yeah, but I guess I'm
not saying that I need that.

569
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:02,180
I'm just saying that that's the
way of a lot of our old ways

570
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,477
of looking at things.

571
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,021
And many people too-- you
know, going to the doctor,

572
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,565
getting the surgery, taking
the pill, all of this

573
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:19,364
is really an illusion.

574
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,074
>> Yeah, it's a belief
system, all of it.

575
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,075
>> It's a belief system.

576
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:30,208
All of it is just there for, you
know, pharmaceutical companies

577
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,503
to make lots of money.

578
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:40,552
And this is why they are so
keen on supporting the illusion.

579
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,137
>> Yeah, but you
cannot do it alone.

580
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,222
>> You can't do it alone, no.

581
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,975
This is disempowering, 

582
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:52,147
is sort of the name of the
game for those structures

583
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:56,693
that are in place in order
for us to be reliant on them.

584
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,069
And that's what
they feed off of.

585
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:03,158
It's sort of
vampire-type energy that

586
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:08,621
can grow because that's the
archetype of that energy.

587
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,709
>> And then there's the trap, a
little bit, to think that that

588
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,336
is just being pursued
in the center,

589
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,507
continued even in
nowadays healing work,

590
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,759
even if you're a very
new paradigm about it.

591
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,804
I've heard this, so I
want to throw this in.

592
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,140
And Arjun-- because I have
my own doubts about this,

593
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,808
before I started doing
private sessions,

594
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:33,146
I wasn't sure if I wanted
to be a part of that idea

595
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,231
that somebody would
come to me for help.

596
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,027
And so I asked him, so
how do you look at this?

597
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,863
And he's like, well,
you've all decided

598
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,033
to be with a lot of people
here, a lot of reflections

599
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,242
of yourself.

600
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,162
So it's also
playful, and joyful,

601
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,873
and beautiful to look
in each other's mirror.

602
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,541
It's what happens
when you fall in love.

603
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,001
It's when you pick your friends.

604
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,128
It's even when you
pick your family,

605
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,465
even though that doesn't always
look like such a pretty mirror.

606
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,258
But all of that
is part of a dance

607
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,219
that you chose to be a part of.

608
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:10,058
So that helped me also
understand and embrace

609
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,478
even the old paradigm
medical system a little more,

610
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,063
to be like, OK,
it is what it is.

611
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,608
And whatever direction
you navigate to most,

612
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,068
just choose that.

613
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,613
And I also go for regular
reflections, I would say,

614
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,491
with colleague
interstellar healers

615
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,496
that are channelers, who
facilitate realignments

616
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,375
to get some more insights
on my own blind spots.

617
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,252
Because there are always
things that you're

618
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,629
learning about and expanding.

619
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,631
>> It's always good to
have another perspective.

620
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,508
>> Totally, yes.

621
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,762
>> So go get a second opinion.

622
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,430
>> Yes, exactly.

623
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,851
I love more angles to a topic.

624
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,685
The more the better.

625
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,812
And then I will pick the one
that resonates most with me.

626
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,729
>> Exactly.

627
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,606
No one is better
than the other--

628
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,567
>> No, it's all good.

629
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,568
>> --for the collective.

630
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,405
But for the individual, you
may have better resonance.

631
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,198
>> And that was the
whole journey, I think,

632
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:11,077
for me to collect the
guts, I would say,

633
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,665
to be faithful to what I
feel resonates most with me.

634
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,042
And just like I said, I
fell in love with this work.

635
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,758
>> You've sort of awoken to
the Yahyel channeling by going

636
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,135
to another channeler?

637
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
>> Yeah, in a sense.

638
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,805
So I've been receiving all
these downloads, mainly

639
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:35,268
in night times, or just
before waking, astral travel

640
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,187
experiences.

641
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:42,233
and divine synchronicity
helped me to actually attend

642
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,821
to one of his group sessions--

643
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,365
And while I was in the audience,
I didn't have any questions.

644
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,035
I was just feeling at home
and being in a bliss state

645
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,870
being with these
energies, because it

646
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,123
felt so much at home,
but not really questions.

647
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,543
And I was sitting there,
and at some point,

648
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,087
the sounds kind of
went down, the lights

649
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,757
dimmed, in my experience,
even though I was

650
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,925
sitting between other people.

651
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:12,138
And I felt super drawn inwards,
so I had to close my eyes.

652
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,016
And I felt other
beings around me.

653
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,643
And to have this
experience in a waking

654
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,645
state, that was new to me.

655
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,064
So I felt very
clearly that there

656
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,191
was work being done on me.

657
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,525
And I could fully relax in it.

658
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,943
It felt super loving.

659
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:29,238
I felt like, oh, I'm in good
hands, this is beautiful.

660
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:34,035
And then a picture was
given to me of, basically,

661
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,995
a cat sitting on my head.

662
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:40,083
And the energy that surrounded
that was very giggly-like,

663
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,085
joyful, "this is funny."

664
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,629
And I thought, OK--

665
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,798
it's like, this is you, and
the cat is on your head,

666
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,300
and it's funny,
and I'm like, OK.

667
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,389
And that whole thing
lasted maybe 10 minutes.

668
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,141
It was a little bit
out-of-time-ish for me.

669
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,937
And then that first half of
the channeling also ended.

670
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,148
And the sounds came back
into the room for me,

671
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,651
the lights went on
again, you could say.

672
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,738
And I was left with
that feeling that a cat

673
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,698
was sitting on my head.

674
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,700
Like an actual pressure,
I could really feel it.

675
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,286
And I was hesitant to
move because I thought

676
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,374
it might fall off, even though
I knew it wasn't really there.

677
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,086
And a year later,
in the Netherlands,

678
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,047
I went to see an
ET channeler woman.

679
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,425
And she lives in the
Netherlands as well.

680
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:36,597
And I actually went to have
my back straightened out.

681
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,474
I had some issues there
between my shoulders.

682
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,477
She said she did
channeling and worked

683
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:46,107
with a team that does
also physical healings

684
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,735
or, like we understand,
a realignment

685
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,404
of your own
self-healing abilities.

686
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,158
And I was curious about
that, so I went there.

687
00:33:55,158 --> 00:34:00,455
And a month before
I went to see her,

688
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,081
Arjun actually
started speaking out

689
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,708
loud to me, which
was quite a surprise

690
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,252
for me because he was
coming closer and closer.

691
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,211
I'd seen his face.

692
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,757
I knew he was with me
during meditations.

693
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,967
And then at some point,
I asked in my mind,

694
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,720
I just opened conversation-- and
he had been waiting for that,

695
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,598
I understand that now--

696
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,640
asking, who are you?

697
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,435
And I got this huge
spelling out, Yah-Yel.

698
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:26,522
Like for him, it was more
logical to first pinpoint--

699
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:30,234
this is who we
are as a race more

700
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,278
where I am from
then to use a name,

701
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,238
because they don't use names.

702
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,241
So I was instantly confused,
thinking, is that his name?

703
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,367
But that's actually a race.

704
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,160
How does that work?

705
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,079
>> Did you hear about
the Yahyel race before?

706
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,580
>> Yeah, I heard
about that by then.

707
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,457
>> By Darryl or
other channelers?

708
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,209
>> Yeah, through Darryl.

709
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,128
And so it confused me.

710
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,924
But also that the answer was
so super crispy clear and loud,

711
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,841
that confused me.

712
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,510
So I instantly like,
whoa, backed away

713
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,181
from it not knowing what to
do with it, left it at that.

714
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,351
And a month later, I
went to see this woman.

715
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,853
And she started
channeling for me.

716
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,982
And maybe two minutes
into working on my back

717
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,069
with her team--

718
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,237
>> Was it a private session?

719
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,363
>> A private session, yes.

720
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,114
So I was laying on
this massage table.

721
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,534
And she started
to look at my back

722
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,912
and what could be done maybe
according to her guides.

723
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,791
And then Arjun was just
jumping up and down like,

724
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,044
hey, hello, I've been trying
to get to this girl for quite

725
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,420
some time now.

726
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,881
And she said, oh, there's
somebody here for you.

727
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,217
And then she just
started speaking for him,

728
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,009
you could say.

729
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,016
Oh, I have to throw this little
thing I forgot to tell you.

730
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,019
Just before the
session, she has a cat

731
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,146
that is basically
identical to the one that

732
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:49,939
was put on my head.

733
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,399
But I did not make
that connection.

734
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,067
>> I was going to
ask, what kind of cat?

735
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,402
>> It's a Nordic Forest cat.

736
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,236
They're pretty big.

737
00:35:55,236 --> 00:36:01,325
They have long fur, a
little bit longer snout,

738
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,995
cute head, so pretty big.

739
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,622
And it jumped on
the table with me.

740
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,584
And it laid down
next to my feet.

741
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,170
And it was just there
rolled up and purring.

742
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,173
And then she started channeling
Arjun for me, who said,

743
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:20,261
you know, you're ready from head
to toe to do this kind of work

744
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,390
yourself if you want to
because we have this agreement.

745
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,184
And then he started
explaining that he is Yahyel.

746
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,937
And I started to
understand, oh, wow.

747
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,063
Or she got it through.

748
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,983
She translated it as she
thought his name was Shayel

749
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,860
because maybe she didn't
know about the race,

750
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,819
so this was funny.

751
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,280
But at least, it gave
me the synchronicity

752
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,241
to understand that what happened
a month earlier was actually

753
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,285
not my imagination.

754
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,246
And I felt a lot of
things happening.

755
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,165
It was like I was
floating off the table.

756
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,791
I was really buzzing.

757
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,210
And they were giving me all
this specific information

758
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,797
about my childhood, how
they'd visited me before.

759
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,091
And everything started to
come together all of a sudden,

760
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,385
very quickly.

761
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,723
It took me about three days to
get used to the entire idea.

762
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,892
And then, as a
life coach by then,

763
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,686
I picked out some
open-minded clients.

764
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:14,440
And I said, so are you
up for an experiment?

765
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,193
and I started to see what 
would come through

766
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,072
and that was an enormous 
journey for me and 

767
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,991
it really sped up the entire 
process and

768
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,618
now here I am...

769
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,577
>>>Very good.

770
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,037
>>It took over the practice 
basically

771
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,997
the effects were so strong

772
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,458
that the normal life coaching 
in a sense just

773
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,001
within 4 months.

774
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,881
>> Tell us a little bit about
your art and how that was

775
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,218
an influence in maybe
transitioning to where you are

776
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,010
now.

777
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,805
How did that come about?

778
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,098
>> I think it was always there.

779
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,933
>> Because I've
seen many of your--

780
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,436
a lot of your art incorporates
extraterrestrial themes.

781
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,856
And when did that start?

782
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,109
Just from when you
were very little?

783
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,028
>> I have some childhood
drawings in which I'm already

784
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:05,908
attempting at that age to draw
the classrooms and where I

785
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,452
believe I went--

786
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,037
what I call astral
school, where I

787
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,790
got the lessons about
universe and how things work.

788
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,251
I would make drawings
of birds with the sky

789
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,963
inside the bird instead of
the bird inside the sky.

790
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,881
Because everything was a loop.

791
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,757
And I got that.

792
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,842
And I have these drawings.

793
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,927
And I made them at
age four or five.

794
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,638
And I'm so surprised.

795
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,432
I actually rediscovered
these drawings--

796
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,933
I thought they were gone--

797
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,101
only three years ago.

798
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,227
And I'm like, wow.

799
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:38,274
A lot of stuff is also being
thrown out, kids stuff,

800
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,567
but this is still there.

801
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:45,031
And it's always been my
outlet for translating

802
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,865
what was coming in.

803
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,911
So in my diaries as a
teenager, starting 12,

804
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,414
I was also making diagrams
of how I understood

805
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,915
the cosmos looked like.

806
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,500
And I was having
questions like, there

807
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,295
must be an edge to
this whole universe,

808
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,340
so what is outside of that?

809
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,884
And then intuitively
understanding

810
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,721
that the more you go outside,
it must look the same

811
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,264
as when you go really inside.

812
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,434
And then going into research
biology and fractals--

813
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,562
and I was doing that
for fun at age 17,

814
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:21,067
getting books from the library
just because I felt drawn

815
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,902
to this kind of information.

816
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,279
But it made no sense at all,
not even for my profession

817
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,072
as an artist.

818
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,783
You don't have to necessarily
read, for instance, philosophy

819
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,575
also.

820
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,660
I was really into
Nietzsche and Jung.

821
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,872
And I wanted to understand
how the mind works.

822
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,831
And then I discovered--

823
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,751
>> Well, there's a lot of
artists out there that explore

824
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,627
those themes.

825
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,505
>> Yes.

826
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,048
It is very intuitive.

827
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,049
It is another language.

828
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,841
>> Is it Da--

829
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,136
I don't know, my appreciation
for art is there,

830
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,429
but I forget everybody's names.

831
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,141
But is it the guy who writes
the melting clocks all the time?

832
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,059
>> Salvador Dali?

833
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,186
>> Yes, Dali, that's right.

834
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,813
And then is that
the same guy that

835
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,108
does those weird dimensional
drawings like the stairs going

836
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:02,900
this way and--

837
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,692
>> Escher.

838
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,361
>> That's Escher, yes, great.

839
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,071
So these guys, I think,
they're probably--

840
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,864
>> I was obsessed by that.

841
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:14,286
But I really do feel it's
one of the languages that's

842
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,706
very close to the
interstellar speech.

843
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,626
Plus is music, by the
way, and even movement.

844
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,926
Yes, sound, movement,
and visuals.

845
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,302
And if you really
dive into that,

846
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,304
yes, I think it's
maybe only logical

847
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,932
that you end up wanting to
know more about philosophy

848
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
and how things work.

849
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,311
But I was a bit nerdy in that.

850
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,772
I would really go for the books
and dive into the websites,

851
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,525
and go explore, and
feel that it makes

852
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,569
sense, and wanting
to do something

853
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,570
with that information.

854
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,823
I don't think all artists
necessarily have that.

855
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:56,454
>> Well, we really are entering
this time in humanity where we

856
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,580
can grasp these concepts.

857
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,623
We sort of had hints of
it throughout our history

858
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,833
with the art.

859
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:06,046
But now with science going into
the quantum fields and quantum

860
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:10,384
theory, we're doing
experiments in those realms.

861
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,262
We're really starting to
figure out the universe.

862
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,847
>> I love it.

863
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,516
>> And I was just posting
an article yesterday,

864
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:23,898
these experiments of how the
present can change the past.

865
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,774
And we can see this in photons.

866
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,402
And this experiment's been
repeated over and over.

867
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:34,325
And they call it the eraser
effect, where what we can do

868
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,703
here now can actually
literally change the past.

869
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,789
And we've known from these
channeling works and art

870
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,251
and everything else that the
only thing that really exists

871
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,253
is the now anyways.

872
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,173
So I find it fascinating
that it's all interconnected.

873
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:49,965
>> Me too.

874
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,427
>> And it's great that you
subconsciously tapped into that

875
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,512
at a young age.

876
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,346
>> Yeah.

877
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,307
And that you can change
the past from the present,

878
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,103
I got that very clearly at
age 26, around and about.

879
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,648
And I started rewriting
my childhood literally.

880
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,024
I made a new diary.

881
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,944
Like I piled up all the old
ones and I made a new one.

882
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,321
I tore out all the
drawings and I threw away

883
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,322
most of the writings.

884
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,782
I kept the dreams, by the way.

885
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,367
It's like this is
what I want to keep.

886
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,745
And these stories
where I was venting,

887
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:24,959
that timeline of my childhood,
I let go of very deliberately.

888
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,002
I was like, OK, this is a part--

889
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,129
I want to switch to
another timeline.

890
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:33,217
So I started to rewrite it,
and that was so powerful.

891
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,803
And it's through this
kind of playing around

892
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,473
with the information that I got
for myself that I eventually

893
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,227
ended up discovering techniques
like tapping and using

894
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,186
that as a life coach.

895
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:48,607
Because I had experienced
in my own life

896
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,902
how powerful these
techniques are and how

897
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,320
you can really use them.

898
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,907
>> And essentially, from
my understanding now,

899
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,120
because I've worked with
tapping and plant medicine work,

900
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,790
we're essentially going
into these quantum states

901
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:10,129
and rewriting the story,
shifting timelines per se.

902
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,631
>> On a cellular level,
actually opening up--

903
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,968
there's these little portals,
in a sense, in your body.

904
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,386
So when I do the
private sessions,

905
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,013
I get to see these details.

906
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,266
And I want to actually
see if I can make

907
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,767
Photoshop examples of that.

908
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,102
>> Well, there's a great video--

909
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,271
I post this all the
time-- out there,

910
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:33,110
this YouTube channel called
Upriser, what's his name?

911
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,194
I forgot the guy's name.

912
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:38,490
But he goes into explaining
how DNA in itself

913
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:44,997
is sort of a dimensional
doorway for bringing

914
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,750
through information
from another dimension.

915
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,918
Gravity as well,
but really the DNA

916
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:55,716
strands and how they
work in the molecules,

917
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,885
with hydrogen within water--

918
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:03,766
you know, two hydrogens
and one oxygen molecule--

919
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:08,312
creating portals to bring
through information.

920
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,982
Like gravity, it's all
interconnected into science.

921
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,861
And we're now merging these
worlds of art, philosophy,

922
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,987
science.

923
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:21,992
And I think quantum physics
is that mechanism we have now

924
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:27,831
that really is like, yeah,
this is how the universe works.

925
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:35,130
And I think our space brothers
and sisters are like, yeah,

926
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,507
they're finally getting it.

927
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,758
>> Yes, they are.

928
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,885
But they're also
so super patient

929
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,303
with those who don't yet.

930
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,389
I love that.

931
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,599
There's so much love, wow.

932
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,852
It blows me away continuously.

933
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,437
>> So what's next?

934
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:56,735
What's your plan with
this tool of channeling?

935
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,903
Where are you going with it?

936
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,405
What do you want to do?

937
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,907
>> Oh, that's a funny question.

938
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,909
I never really think
into the future

939
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,453
that much because I think
that's really weird.

940
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:12,042
I mean, I almost feel my brain
cramp up trying to do that.

941
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,210
That never worked for me.

942
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,545
So I don't think ahead.

943
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,964
>> So you're sort of living
the Yahyel philosophy--

944
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,756
>> Already, yeah.

945
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:21,093
>> --of synchronicities
and living in the moment.

946
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,846
>> Let's see what
happens, totally.

947
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,640
Planning ahead really
never worked for me.

948
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,100
This is why as a
child at school,

949
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,728
I was already having issues with
the way they see the future.

950
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,063
This is what you're going to
do, and then logically, you

951
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,857
would go to m-m-m.

952
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:41,613
So I'm still not planning
anything, only like loosely.

953
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,491
Like OK, I feel it's time
to move maybe location,

954
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,953
so I'll move to a
more foresty location.

955
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,538
That's a plan that
I have right now.

956
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,875
But there's no stress on
it, there's no deadline.

957
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,126
And I know it will come to me.

958
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,669
The house is basically
already there.

959
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:59,631
I just have to discover it in
a here and now timeline, which

960
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,550
will be there eventually.

961
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:08,348
So the channeling also is
teaching me to surrender

962
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,058
even more to the here and now.

963
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,187
Because it's such a here
and now state to be in,

964
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,607
there's nothing else, everything
else disappears for me.

965
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,733
>> In the channeling state.

966
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,568
>> Yeah.

967
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,530
>> You know, many channelers
these days don't go into that

968
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,740
deep trance so much.

969
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,492
Are you present and aware?

970
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:30,120
>> I'm present, but I'm moving
in and out of the amount

971
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,164
of presence, I guess.

972
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:36,460
I can move it to the back
a little more and kind of

973
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,170
lose track of where
things are going.

974
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,174
But I'll still get a hint, OK,
now this dialogue is finished,

975
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,217
we've gone to the next.

976
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,721
And then I wake up again, pay
attention to new storyline.

977
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,974
And I have to be more present
when I'm doing it in English,

978
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,560
as it's my second language.

979
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,482
In Dutch, in my first language,
I can drift a little bit more.

980
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,650
>> Go on autopilot.

981
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,277
>> Yeah, a little more.

982
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,445
But it's in and out.

983
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:07,032
And if they increase the tempo,
I'm more on one word at a time,

984
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,451
translating one word
at a time, instead of--

985
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,829
I've had moments where I don't
know where the sentence is

986
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,833
going at all, just focusing
on the correct pronunciation

987
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,501
of every word.

988
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,711
But I'm still conscious.

989
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:24,299
>> And then do you surprise
yourself when you go in those

990
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,844
one word at a time moments, and
then afterwards, you're like,

991
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,303
oh, I actually made
a full sentence?

992
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,137
>> Yes, I do.

993
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,138
I'm like, wow.

994
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,515
>> People understood
what I said.

995
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,267
>> This actually went somewhere.

996
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,102
Yes, I have these moments.

997
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,229
Sometimes the sentences are--

998
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,730
you know, if you
would read them,

999
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,316
they have 12 commas in them.

1000
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,652
Like, whoa, where is
this ever going to end?

1001
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,112
And then it still makes sense.

1002
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:45,904
I love that.

1003
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,324
>> Yeah, since
starting the series,

1004
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,702
and investigating channeling
and going into it,

1005
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,455
and having my own
channeling experiences,

1006
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,666
I have the same thing.

1007
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:02,921
I've channeled information,
and in my mind, I'm like,

1008
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,674
this is not going to
make any sense at all.

1009
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,466
>> Exactly.

1010
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,261
>> It's gibberish,
what is this--

1011
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,971
in the moment that
you're doing it,

1012
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,056
because it's more of a feeling.

1013
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,475
You're just like, OK, I get
it, but the rest of the world,

1014
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:15,934
they can't get this.

1015
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,561
And then you go back
and you review it,

1016
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,730
and you're like,
holy smokes, it's

1017
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,941
actually using
semi-correct grammar even.

1018
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,527
And you're like, wow,
that's incredible.

1019
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,528
>> Recognizable.

1020
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:31,575
>> So for all those watching out
there, this channeling stuff,

1021
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,702
there's something to it.

1022
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,789
Yeah, it's funny how
sometimes I have conversations

1023
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:42,336
with people who aren't familiar
with what channeling is.

1024
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:47,633
And they think
it's just a big act.

1025
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,844
And I'm like, no, you can't.

1026
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,723
I mean, there are
actors who channel.

1027
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,059
You know, I think
actors do channel.

1028
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,435
>> It's a form of channeling.

1029
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,812
>> When you get into that
state, it just comes naturally.

1030
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,649
And the better ones,
the better actors

1031
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,611
do get into that
channeling state.

1032
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:12,449
But to make it up--

1033
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,409
and I guess we are making
it up as we go along.

1034
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,453
But it's the ultimate improv-- right?

1035
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,537
>> Yeah.

1036
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,623
>> --where you're just
completely surrender and just

1037
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,415
whatever comes out.

1038
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,377
But the information
that's coming out

1039
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:29,800
was not scripted and not
pre-learned dialogue.

1040
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,304
It just comes out, and
it's quite phenomenal.

1041
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,974
>> And that's why, I think,
I felt so pulled towards

1042
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,144
meditation and
emptying the mind out.

1043
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,813
I fell in love with
that very young,

1044
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,899
so I started practicing
that and then the chanting,

1045
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,152
was a Buddhist for a while.

1046
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,781
And then at some
point, Arjun just

1047
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,410
stepped forward and let
me know, OK, you're ready,

1048
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,372
let's do this if you want.

1049
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,331
It's full surrender.

1050
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,711
>> I'm so glad you have chosen
this path to do this and share

1051
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:10,632
the information and bring
forth these beings that we can

1052
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,636
hopefully soon, sooner than
later, meet face to face,

1053
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,471
in a physical interaction.

1054
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,264
>> Who knows.

1055
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,850
>> But in the meantime, we
have this wonderful gift.

1056
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,642
>> Yes.

1057
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,812
>> And thank you for bringing
this out and sharing it.

1058
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,566
>> Thank you for sharing it
in this way with the world--

1059
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,192
>> This is my channel
with the cameras.

1060
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,610
>> --on an even bigger platform.

1061
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,529
Yes, it all intertwines.

1062
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,156
I love it.

1063
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,951
>> Well, we'll get into some
channeling then and see where

1064
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,744
it goes from there.

1065
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,494
>> Yes, OK.

1066
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,036
>> Awesome.

1067
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:40,746
Thank you.

1068
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,538
>> Thank you.

1069
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,916
