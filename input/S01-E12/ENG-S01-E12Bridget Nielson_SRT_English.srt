The path of my
journey has taken me

5
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,511
to Sedona, Arizona
several times.

6
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:58,808
And every time I leave, I find
myself making plans to return.

7
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,518
It was one of the
first discoveries

8
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,105
I made during my research
into the ET subject matter.

9
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,983
Sure, it was a hard
one to swallow.

10
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,818
I remember going to
an ET meetup group

11
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,780
at the Flying Saucer
Cafe in Santa Monica.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,490
Some of the experts
there said that they

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,367
had spoken to several
abductees who claimed to have

14
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,286
seen these children on ships.

15
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,247
They said they
were teaching them

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,460
how to do mundane daily tasks,
like go grocery shopping

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,087
and wash dishes.

18
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,382
Well, at the time, I
thought it was ridiculous.

19
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,301
But several years
into my research,

20
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,805
now I know it to be
more true than not.

21
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,683
In fact, all of the
extra dimensional beings

22
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,311
I've interviewed so
far have all confirmed

23
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,065
the programs and the
existence of hybrid children.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,781
Today, I'm meeting with Bridget
Nielsen, a beautiful young lady

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,699
who says she can
communicate directly

26
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,910
with these hybrid children.

27
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,870
She claims that she
can even show me

28
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,207
how to connect to my children.

conscious memory

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,379
of being on board any
ships and having my essence

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,508

to follow along and see

34
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,371
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

35
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,789
life elsewhere in the universe?

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,668
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

37
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,004
My name is Reuben Langdon.

38
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,383
And on March 29th, 2007, in the middle of the day,

39
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,512
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

40
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,014
Coincidentally, I was working on

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,266
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

42
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,603
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

43
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,564
A quest to find out if aliens truly do exist and if so...

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,275
...are they here with us?

45
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,241
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

46
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,076
...what is their purpose?

47
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,787
Why don't they make themselves more known?

48
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,414
Why the secrecy?

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,666
I've asked these questions to many experts,

50
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,336
yet, each seems to have a different theory.

51
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,796
So I thought to myself, 

52
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,382
why not ask the aliens directly?

53
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,426
So that's what I set out to do!

54
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,802
Well, sort of...

55
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,525

the alien hybrids.

56
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,317
>> Woo.

00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:43,157

00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,575

62
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:54,377
>> Yeah, it's the least expected
career path I would have ever

63
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,169
thought, I guess.

64
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,295
>> Career path?

65
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,839
>> Well, it kind of
is a career path.

66
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,800
It's like, well, it's my
passion path, I guess more so.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,969
So it's not what I
would have expected.

68
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,180
And it started
with doing a bunch

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,309
of healing, different
trainings that I was doing--

70
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,728
like I told you earlier--

71
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,939
doing different past
life stuff, Earthbound

72
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,692
spirits, mediumship, of
those kind of things--

73
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,694
angels, guides.

74
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,904
And a part of that
was abduction.

75
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,783
And I thought, I was cool with
all the other inter-dimensional

76
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,993
stuff, but not abduction.

77
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,580
>> And this is helping other
people with their past lives.

78
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
>> Yeah.

79
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,542
So I would channel that through.

80
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,627
So I would, like, connect
with their other lives

81
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,880
and bring that through, or
connect with their guides

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,174
and communicate from them--

83
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,967
those kinds of things.

84
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,054
>> Before we jump ahead,
can you just tell me,

85
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,639
how did you stumble upon
that work in itself?

86
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,729
Because that realm, it's
not common for people to--

87
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,189
it's becoming more
common, I guess.

88
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,109
But what led you into that path?

89
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,237
>> One, being in Los Angeles.

90
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,741
So that opens up that door.

91
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,454
Two-- you know, it was right
after I got out of college.

92
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:16,959
And then I went immediately
into, like, advertising,

93
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,586
big time corporate advertising.

94
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:23,174
And just like really dove
into the corporate world.

95
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:29,097
And then after that experience,
as well as, like, boyfriends

96
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,851
and my own stuff, I just went so deep
into something energetically

97
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,062
that I wasn't, that
I just catapulted

98
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,358
to another extreme of I'm
going, I need to, like,

99
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,570
look at what I really
am passionate about,

100
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,741
and look at what my gifts are.

101
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,661
And, like, fix my
own personal stuff.

102
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,832
Like, why am I experiencing
certain things?

103
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,542
>> And when you say
deep in something you

104
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,293
weren't, that's the
corporate world?

105
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,087
>> The corporate world
and stuff like that.

106
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,506
>> So you were doing
the 9:00 to 5:00--

107
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:09,220
>> Yeah, 24 hour iPhone as
the pillow kind of thing.

108
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,640
>> And then that felt not right,
so then that's the catapult

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,516
you're talking about.

110
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,561
So you went the other direction,
the opposite of 9:00 to 5:00--

111
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,645
the opposite of corporate.

112
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,105
OK, gotcha.

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:24,277
>> And even as a kid, I just
was very attuned to, like

114
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,319
I loved fairies.

115
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,821
I loved nature.

116
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,739
I can sense certain things.

117
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,742
I could definitely feel a
lot more going on with people

118
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,912
than they knew themselves.

119
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,290
And I had those
extra sensitivities.

120
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,917
And then over the years and
years and years of schooling,

121
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,921
they started to dwindle,
and dwindle, go away.

122
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,091
And then once I hit the
extreme of then going corporate

123
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,720
after all the schooling,
it was just so far,

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,473
that I knew exactly where to go.

125
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
I was like, let's
go back to nature.

126
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,643
Let's go back to
my natural self.

127
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,646
And at that time,
too, my dad was

128
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,066
heavy into the metaphysical
community in LA.

129
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,777
So he was going to
Bashar channelings.

130
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,990
And he was doing
channeling-like stuff himself.

131
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,537
And then he was connected
with a shaman in Los Angeles,

132
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,122
and we were doing
family constellation

133
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:22,710
work, which heals family
traumas that are passed down.

134
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,170
And so he was in that.

135
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,256
And I was dabbling
and I knew about it.

136
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,717
But once I had gone
to such an extreme,

137
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,970
I went, OK, well I need to
look more at like who I am,

138
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,849
and where is this originating
from like, in my lineage?

139
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,769
Why am I creating
certain challenge like

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,270
in relationships?

141
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,565
What is the source of
my motivations in life?

142
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,442
And so I started
working with a shaman.

143
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,819
And I worked with
another clairvoyant too.

144
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,240
And I just started learning
all that they were doing.

145
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,162
And then I could see that I
had these sensitivities too.

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,957
Once I could see them
doing all of that stuff,

147
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,042
I went, oh I can do that too.

148
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,419
But it was so natural, that
I didn't know I was doing it.

149
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,295
>> Got you.

150
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:10,216
>> So then I went hmm,
well, let's dive into that.

151
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,843
And so then I did
different healing trainings.

152
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,888
And at that time, I
didn't believe fully--

153
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,184
I didn't have the visceral
experience of other lives,

154
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,270
like other simultaneous
incarnations.

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,147
I didn't really believe
in Earthbound spirits.

156
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,942
It wasn't, like
intellectually,

157
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,319
it wasn't matched
with my experience.

158
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,904
So that was one of
the primary reasons

159
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,282
that I went to do
the training, was

160
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,869
to see if it
actually hit to have

161
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,665
an experience with
these different segments

162
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,419
that people just flippantly,
like, throw around.

163
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,628
Like, 'Oh, my past life.'

164
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,590
And I'm going, no,

165
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,426
how does that relate
to this here and now?

166
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,802
And how do you know?

167
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,804
Like, where's the
knowingness behind that?

168
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,806
So I wanted to know
that for myself

169
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,350
before I just went
around just saying stuff.

170
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,143
>> Right.

171
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:07,690
>> And so then at that training,
I experienced crazy things that

172
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,649
were--

173
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,776
I mean, even backed
up by like Google--

174
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:15,489
certain things I was channeling
of different, like, spirits and

175
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,782
crazy things that were just--

176
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,825
>> When you say
backed up by Google,

177
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,909
what do you mean by that?

178
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,995
You would Google it later after
you've had the experience?

179
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,080
>> Yeah, after I had the
experience, it was like,

180
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,042
what I had brought through was
actually backed up by like,

181
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,212
historically in Google, like
different things that had happened.

182
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,714
>> Can you describe how?

183
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,967
You got us going
here, for example?

184
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,638
>> For example, we were staying
in a retreat center in 

185
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,472
San Diego.

186
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,267
And it, itself, had kind
of interesting energies.

187
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,979
And that day, out of
the two week thing,

188
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,190
we had worked with
Earthbound spirits

189
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,525
and worked with people
that had passed.

190
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,361
And so that night,
my roommate and I

191
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,862
were both going back and forth.

192
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,239
And she was from England,
so she was telling me

193
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,534
about all the ghosts in
all the castles in England

194
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,496
that she would work
with and stuff.

195
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,247
And so we're just dialoguing.

196
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,457
And the door was open.

197
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,334
And the energy was open.

198
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,046
We were kind of like calling
it in, I guess you could say.

199
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:16,509
And then I could perceive, I could
feel beings walk into the room.

200
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,011
And it was three little
girls that I perceived.

201
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,971
And at the same time
I felt that, she

202
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,015
looked in the same direction.

203
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,518
And so I knew that
something was going on.

204
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,729
And we both are going oh,
like, something just happened.

205
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,522
>> Right, right.

206
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,901
>> And so then, at that moment,
we were like OK, this is it!

207
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,528
Like, something's going on.

208
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
And so I got out my pendulum.

209
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,656
And she's channeling too.

210
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,866
So both of us together
were going back and forth.

211
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,120
And what came
through, through me--

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,746
that I could hear from them--

213
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,331
is that there were
three little girls

214
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,000
that had been murdered
on this property

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,505
by this religious
group, by this, like--

216
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,174
I guess he was some kind
of bishop or something

217
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,635
that ran a center.

218
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,388
And he murdered them.

219
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,350
And they just were
stuck in this dimension,

220
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,522
because if it's an abrupt ending
or if it's unfinished, then

221
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,274
of course, you
kind of stay bound

222
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,359
to this until it's complete.

223
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,780
Or if you have a drug overdose,
or you get in a car accident,

224
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,200
those kinds of
things lead to where

225
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,035
those beings need
extra assistance

226
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,288
to move into the light.

227
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,167
And so we worked with
these little girls.

228
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,377
>> Your other friend from
England, she was there too?

229
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,879
Simultaneously getting
the same downloads?

230
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,880
>> Yes, same downloads.

231
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,676
>> So you were able to confirm
with her later the same

232
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
information?

233
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,803
>> Yes.
>>OK.

234
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,015
>>And then at the same time too,
so we sent them into the light.

235
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,683
We assisted them.

236
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,935
And then, I got on
my phone on Google,

237
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,437
and they gave me the year,

238
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,108
they gave that it was some kind
of religious guy that did it.

239
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,069
We knew the location,
three little girls.

240
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,364
And I Googled it, and
it was like on Google.

241
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,533
Like, three little
girls murdered

242
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,452
by this guy at this location.

243
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,370
And I'm like, oh!

244
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,789
So that was like
my first experience

245
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,375
of getting the
information and then

246
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,212
having it instantly
validated to reinforce.

247
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,004
>> Instantly.

248
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,797
Google.

249
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,256
We can do that now on the phone.

250
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,382
You didn't even wait
till you got home.

251
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,217
You went right on the phone.

252
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,301
>> Right on the phone.

253
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,094
I was like, OK.

254
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,970
Am I crazy?

255
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,639
So it was instantly validated.

256
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,431
>> Nice.

257
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,057
>> Yeah.

258
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,642
>> So that led you

259
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,979
 into dabbling into healing others.

260
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,942
You said assisting others
with alien abductions?

261
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,817
>> Yeah.

262
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:43,614
So that was one baby
sliver of the two weeks.

263
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,701
And I thought it was crazy.

264
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,747
But at the same time, I was
open, because I had to be open.

265
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,667
That was my mission, was
to be open, to understand.

266
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,378
>> Open, meaning transparent,
telling friends and family

267
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,170
and the world?

268
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,840
>> Open in the way of like,
I was open to believing it.

269
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,801
I was open to acknowledging
that that was their experience.

270
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,969
>> OK.

271
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,721
Yeah, after you've had that
experience, how could you not?

272
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,138
>> Yeah.

273
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,931
Yeah.

274
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,476
So I mean, it was a
different segment,

275
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,396
but it all fits
into the same thing.

276
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,731
And a lot of people in
the spiritual community

277
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,402
don't translate over to
extraterrestrials, sometimes.

278
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,529
>> A lot of extraterrestrial
people don't translate

279
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:29,994
into other realms and things.

280
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:35,249
Which is, for me, I found
very hard to understand

281
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,083
those people.

282
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,335
Because it's like, if it's one--

283
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,879
I mean, if you're going to
let your brain leak out,

284
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,089
you might as well just let it--

285
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,881
>> Go all the way.

286
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,216
>> --just go full.

287
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,637
Full disclosure, full peanut
butter, go all the way in.

288
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,805
Might as well.

289
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,350
>> I'm with you on
all of that, yeah.

290
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,937
>> Because when you throw
out all scientific logic,

291
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,899
for one thing, why not throw
it out for the other stuff?

292
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,818
>> You've got to be open
to throwing everything out.

293
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,237
And it just spins and spirals.

294
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,448
But the abduction thing
was the last thing

295
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,825
I was going to throw
out. Which you'd think

296
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,951
for a lot of people, it is.

297
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,412
>> So that's meaning the
hardest thing for you to--

298
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:13,871
>> Acknowledge.

299
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,497
>> --acknowledge that
that's the truth.

300
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,249
>> Yes.
>> So ghost, you've got that.

301
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,085
>> Ghost, past lives, good.

302
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,879
Angels, great.

303
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,672
Fairies, awesome.

304
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,548
Aliens, no.

305
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,424
>> Mermaids?

306
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,592
>> Yes!

307
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,886
>> Yes on mermaids
before alien abductions.

308
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,678
>> Yeah.

309
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,220
>> Wow.

310
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,055
OK, never mind.

311
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,847
That's good.

312
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,851
>> I really like mermaids.

313
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,978
>> I figured you would,
that's why I brought it up.

314
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,609
So then, aliens.

315
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,069
>> So, aliens.

316
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,448
>> Aliens, in essence,
aliens or alien abductions?

317
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,200
Was it the abduction phenomenon?

318
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,117
>> Abduction.

319
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,910
I was fine.

320
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,997
See, yet again, it's
like star family is OK.

321
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,916
Alien abductions isn't.

322
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:05,089
And it's nice having had my
own belief dot disconnect,

323
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,300
because now I can see where
it is for other people, which

324
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,761
is just programming.

325
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,014
So in another part
of the training,

326
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,891
we had talked about star beings.

327
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,395
It's like, oh, you have other
lives from Sirius and Pleiades.

328
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,522
And I was good with that.

329
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,565
I'm like, that
sounds really cool.

330
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,525
I'm into that.

331
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,818
And then it's like,
alien abduction?

332
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,652
No.

333
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,197
So I definitely
had a disconnect.

334
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:34,034
But then as I started
doing this and working

335
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,663
with these different clients,
I would have almost all

336
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,541
of them were abductees.

337
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,627
And then I contacted
the different people

338
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,670
that I was trained with--

339
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,546
>> Male and female?

340
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,588
Or was it--

341
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,923
>> Male and female.

342
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,882
Yeah.

343
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,219
And I contacted the other
women I was trained with.

344
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,221
And I said, are you
getting abductees?

345
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,557
And they were like, no.

346
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,060
Like, uh, why am I getting
all the abductees, you know?

347
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,145
I didn't want to.

348
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,524
There was nothing in my, like,
ego or anything that wanted to.

349
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,278
But it was resonance
for some reason.

350
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,113
So you were working with these people.

351
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,115
What did you call
yourself, I guess?

352
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,408
A spiritual healer?

353
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,037
Or did you have a business card?

354
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,663
>> I had a business card.

355
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,415
I was a healer, I guess.

356
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,291
So I was a healer.

357
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,669
I did different shamanic
work, trauma release,

358
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,712
different stuff.

359
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,214
And then, more of the
metaphysical things too.

360
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,425
So it was just like
the full spectrum

361
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,843
of whatever was needed.

362
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,219
>> OK, gotcha.

363
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,429
>> So I was healer.

364
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,642
>> And then you had other, I
guess, coworkers, co-healers,

365
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,063
that were also using the
same modalities to help other

366
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:44,855
people.

367
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,984
And that was colleagues
that you could consult with.

368
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,818
>> Mm-hmm.

369
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,611
>> Got it.

370
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,821
>> Yeah, and none of
them had had this--

371
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,614
>> And none of them
had had an abduction.

372
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,199
>> None of them were
getting abducted.

373
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,076
>> But had they heard of the
abduction phenomenon prior?

374
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:58,494
>> Yeah, yeah.

375
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:58,994
>> OK.

376
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,330
And you had heard of
it, too, from movies?

377
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,874
>> Well, that, and it was
part of the healing training.

378
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,666
>> Oh, it was?

379
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,376
>> Yeah, just like
a small segment.

380
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,462
So it was acknowledged.

381
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,630
And there was a checking.

382
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,340
It was kind of like
a checklist of what

383
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,716
could be out of
alignment, or what

384
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,720
could be the origin of
discomfort or trauma.

385
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,266
And right there is, like,
implants, like alien abduction.

386
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,270
And so I'd have to go through it
every time, and every time that

387
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
came up.

388
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,608
So I thought, hmm,
it's coming up.

389
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,193
I need to look at this.

390
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,027
And so I did.

391
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,278
>> Yeah.

392
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,655
In what way?

393
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:39,076
>> In the way that, well,
my dad was simultaneously

394
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:43,205
in the conspiracy avenue.

395
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,957
And he was like,
there are aliens.

396
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,958
There's evidence.

397
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,209
There's science.

398
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,878
And I'm on this metaphysical,
like, healing side, being like,

399
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,798
there's people saying
they're abducted.

400
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,466
>> The government's
covering it up.

401
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
It's a big thing.

402
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,593
Yeah, I've been down that path.

403
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,678
>> Exactly.

404
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,682
But it was good, because
there was the science evidence

405
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,560
aspect, and then
there was me, like,

406
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,313
having the
experiential situations

407
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,940
going on with these clients.

408
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,568
So we were like comparing and
contrasting notes, you know?

409
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,820
He would be like, well I
watched this abduction video

410
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,446
where they were
taking eggs and semen.

411
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,199
And then the person
would be like, yeah,

412
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,285
I saw myself on the table.

413
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,870
And so I had no context.

414
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,747
And it was just what these
people were telling me.

415
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,543
And so it was two worlds
kind of converging

416
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,337
to support this new idea.

417
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,383
>> About how long ago was
this, I guess, in day and age?

418
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:41,555
>> I guess, this was
about four years ago,

419
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,890
four or five years ago.

420
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,682
>> I see.

421
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,225
>> Yeah.

422
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,437
>> So enough information
is out there,

423
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,480
or had been out
there at that time,

424
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,568
to kind of put the
puzzle pieces together.

425
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,447
And you had different aspects
of the puzzle pieces, I see.

426
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,449
So what happened after that?

427
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,327
How did you help
these people who

428
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:08,874
claim to have abductions
and implants too?

429
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,209
Did they claim to have implants?

430
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:10,626
>> Yeah.

431
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,377
>> So how would you
go about helping them?

432
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:18,467
>> Well, we were told the
greater story of the Zetas.

433
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,969
>> From..?

434
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,181
>> From the woman that was
putting this on, she had that

435
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,893
perspective via Lisa Royal and
different people that she had

436
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,685
studied.

437
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,645
So there was the Zeta--

438
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,107
>> The woman who trained you
in the healing modalities?

439
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:34,900
>> Yeah.

440
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,734
>> OK.

441
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,653
So you actually got
kind of a certification

442
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,654
from her and stuff?

443
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,446
>> Uh-huh.

444
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,280
>> OK, I see.

445
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,742
>> And so she had this
perspective of going, OK

446
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,370
the Grays were this.

447
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,206
And they didn't have
emotion, so there was this.

448
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,416
And then it caused
trauma in people.

449
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,670
So we kind of had the
objective perspective.

450
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,049
I went at it more from
a trauma perspective,

451
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,719
rather than trying to cope
with the idea of aliens.

452
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,305
It was like, OK
this was a trauma.

453
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,934
And it kind of feels like
maybe a sexual trauma.

454
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,311
So like, how can
we look at that?

455
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,523
And part of it, in any
kind of healing modality,

456
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,901
is just acknowledgment,
just for it to be spoken.

457
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,404
And then that energy
is like released.

458
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,740
And so that was probably
like the biggest first step.

459
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,410
And I wouldn't go into
it too much at that time.

460
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,538
I went into more of the
other avenues that were up,

461
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,207
but just acknowledging it and
going through it in the session

462
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,584
was what I did.

463
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,462
>> And by just bringing that
up and acknowledging it,

464
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,048
did you see a transformation in
the people that you're working

465
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,382
with?

466
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,216
>> Yeah.

467
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,886
>> Would they have memories
that they would recall?

468
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,721
>> Yeah.

469
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,722
>> OK.

470
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,224
What was that like?

471
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,270
>> I mean, it was interesting,
because as you know with

472
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:59,776
the abductees, it's like, it's
someone's personal experience.

473
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,694
And that is powerful.

474
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,489
>> And a lot of times, our
sexual organs and our body

475
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,867
parts are very personal to us.

476
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,537
So when those areas get
violated, it hits home.

477
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
>> Yes.

478
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
>> Yeah, absolutely.

479
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,626
>> And so for me, it was just,
like, compassion and going,

480
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,295
whoa.

481
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,757
It just solidified
that reality for them--

482
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,508
because it wasn't my reality--

483
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,843
was real.

484
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,804
And so it just brought that
to a deeper place in me.

485
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,597
>> Yeah.

486
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,431
>> Yeah.

487
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,685
>> And you worked with enough
people to verify that they

488
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,978
weren't making it up.

489
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,812
>> Yeah.

490
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,065
And that's the thing.

491
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,609
No one wants to make up
that they were abducted.

492
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,652
I don't think that this
is like said enough.

493
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,156
There's no catalyst
of popularity

494
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,033
that is gonna come
from saying that.

495
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,992
>> I agree.

496
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,702
I've spoken to--

497
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,079
I think I mentioned
earlier, I've

498
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,458
spoken to probably
over 100 contactees.

499
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,544
Mix match, some
abductees, experiencers,

500
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,798
contactees, there's
whole subcategories

501
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,175
of that whole batch.

502
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,635
It's very hard.

503
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:14,059
Even government people
who have high level positions

504
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,895
and have everything
in the world to lose

505
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,857
by saying something like that.

506
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,984
And they're very brave,
I think, the ones

507
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,862
that do come forward
and speak of it.

508
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,280
And they're very reluctant.

509
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,366
A lot of them that
have kept secrets

510
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:34,496
for 20, 30, 40, 50 years old.

511
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:39,543
>> So you said until that time,
you hadn't associated it with

512
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,753
a personal experience.

513
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,130
Then what happened?

514
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,007
>> Then, I had to
honor the fear.

515
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,801
Because I was like
OK well, I might not

516
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,885
have personal experience.

517
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,472
But am I fearful
of this idea, of ETs

518
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,766
coming and taking
me out of my bed?

519
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,102
Yeah, sure.

520
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,105
It was a hypothetical
situation, still.

521
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,025
And then I watched
"The Fourth Kind".

522
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,695
And "The Fourth
Kind" changed it all.

523
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
>> In a positive, negative way?

524
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,615
>> Surprisingly, a positive way.

525
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,452
Because the show
completely freaked me out.

526
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,164
So you would think that it would
have repelled me even farther

527
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,373
from looking at it.

528
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,042
But I'm strange.

529
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,921
And so then after
watching it, I

530
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,257
knew about the idea
of hybrid children.

531
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:32,053
And so then I went to my
room and I just asked, like

532
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,558
with my full openness,
like full heart--

533
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,769
I will go down whatever
road this leads me.

534
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,980
Do I have hybrid children?

535
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,028
And well actually before
that, it was through the healing

536
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,573
stuff, it showed that
you could be abducted

537
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,745
in another life that was, like,
kind of simultaneous to now,

538
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,871
as well as this life.

539
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:02,584
And so I asked first, do I have
hybrid kids from another life?

540
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,502
Still kind of like
pushing it away.

541
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,379
>> Without asking the
question directly.

542
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,923
>> And then I was
just like..

543
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:08,673
>>Who would you ask?

544
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,801
Is this like a prayer to God?

545
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,553
>> That's a good question.

546
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,554
>> --or the universe?

547
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,139
Because a lot of
people have different

548
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,100
labels for their belief system.

549
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,062
So I'm just curious in how
would you present that.

550
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:22,896
>> Right.

551
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:28,235
So by that time for me, I
had a pretty clear attunement

552
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,948
to many streams of
different beings.

553
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,077
So I mean, I'm like, I had a
very clear awareness of what

554
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,580
an angel felt like, or
what a guide felt like,

555
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,501
or what an ancestor felt like,
these different frequencies

556
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,627
of asking.

557
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,421
And within the healing
work that I did,

558
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:52,759
it was all about creating
a real visceral experience

559
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,054
of your inter-dimensional
support team that you have.

560
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,640
So like everyone
has guardian angels.

561
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,599
Everyone has guides.

562
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,017
>> When you say
inter-dimensional,

563
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,269
that could also be
extra-dimensional?

564
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,103
>> Yes.

565
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,189
>> So just these
otherworldly beings?

566
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,441
>> Otherworldy beings, yeah.

567
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:13,405
And so I cultivated that really
strong communication conduit

568
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:18,118
to my own guidance system,
as well as my higher self.

569
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,204
So it would be my guidance
system and my higher self

570
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,580
that I'd be asking.

571
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,416
And probably for
this question, I

572
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,835
was probably asking Source itself.

573
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,421
Like, all right, let's have it.

574
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,007
>> All of you guides,
and the big cheese.

575
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:32,799
>> Yeah.

576
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,093
Is this the case?

577
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,387
>> And what was your answer?

578
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,558
>> The biggest yes I
have ever received.

579
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,977
Like, it just hit me so hard.

580
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,312
And I just started bawling.

581
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,897
And it opened this
emotional conduit in me

582
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:52,277
that I don't think I had had
this emotional an experience.

583
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,615
>> And up until this, you hadn't
had any conscious sightings

584
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,535
or lost time or
abduction-type things?

585
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,912
>> Not that I remembered.

586
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:06,958
The only thing that was sticky
that I could kind of look back

587
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,169
to was when I was,

588
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,754
I kept on having
this really strong feeling

589
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,424
that I was pregnant, a lot.

590
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,592
And I was a virgin.

591
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:21,306
And so that stuck
with me my whole life,

592
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,516
because I would always
say it to my mom.

593
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,852
And she would say
that I was strange.

594
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,773
And really, like no,
you're not pregnant!

595
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,732
So that stuck.

596
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,443
That was, like, there.

597
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,737
>> So that was always
there, even before you asked

598
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,571
the question?

599
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,323
It was a little kind
of, that was strange.

600
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,574
>> That was strange.

601
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,368
And looking back
on it now, I mean,

602
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,828
a lot of different
memories have come back up.

603
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,040
But another thing that is
strange that I haven't even

604
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,503
put together really, until this
past year, is from about age 8

605
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:56,591
to age 12, I would create
these really large families

606
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,967
of paper dolls--

607
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:03,556
like children and parents of
all different shapes and sizes.

608
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,685
And my cousin and I would create
little videos of these families

609
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,979
in these different scenarios.

610
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:16,236
And just the way that we did
it was not just like playing.

611
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,197
Like, there was some kind
of an intimate relationship.

612
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,326
And there were way too
many kids and certain style

613
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,786
that both of us
were coming from.

614
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,789
It was very odd and interesting.

615
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,960
So I feel like that
was remembrance

616
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,922
and a bringing through of things
I had seen on the ship that

617
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,715
was coming through.

618
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,342
>> So you asked the question.

619
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,053
You got a big knock
on the head, yes.

620
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,973
Immediately, did
memories and visions

621
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,308
start pulling through
of experiences?

622
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,437
Or how did you start to
come to that realization?

623
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,188
What was the
validation, I guess?

624
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,690
If you got a yes,
I'm sure there had

625
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,024
to be some sort of validation.

626
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:55,817
>> Right.

627
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,821
The validation-- I guess
this is almost an answer

628
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,033
to your question-- but
was I could hear them.

629
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,119
>> Could hear the kids?

630
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,913
>> So the yes was from the kids.

631
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,998
And I could hear them.

632
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,040
And it was a portal.

633
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,210
And it was an energy
stream from certain beings

634
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,463
that I had never
heard from before.

635
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,633
And so the full building of
the spectrum of all the beings

636
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,554
that I was connected
to, validated like

637
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:29,434
my communication
and my confidence

638
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,561
with these certain beings.

639
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,981
So by the time these kids
started talking, I'm going,

640
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,149
that's a new branch.

641
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,485
Like, this is a new energy.

642
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,111
This is a new thing.

643
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:45,408
And so that was validating based
on all the other things that

644
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:50,330
had built up my confidence
in this healing extrasensory

645
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,456
arena.

646
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,499
>> So what happened next?

647
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,502
I mean, after that, you
got the hit in the head.

648
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,586
>> After that?

649
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,172
>> Then you started
hearing these voices.

650
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,591
Did you communicate
back with them?

651
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,677
Did you have conversations?

652
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:12,101
>> For the next
probably five months,

653
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:16,231
I had to sleep on it for
five months, pretty much.

654
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,608
I knew that it was true.

655
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,444
But I was not ready to
go forward or do anything

656
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,237
with that.

657
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,990
Like it was just sitting, kind
of like dormant, waiting

658
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,203
to like burst to another level.

659
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,580
So I just kind of
sat with it and let

660
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,123
it digest for that long.

661
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,083
>> I see.

662
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,127
Did you sit on
it with more downloads, or no?

663
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
>> No.

664
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,048
No, I just sat with it.

665
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,424
>> Didn't ask any
more questions?

666
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,300
>> I didn't ask.

667
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,594
That was the only
question that needed

668
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,929
to be asked at that moment.

669
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,514
>> Yeah, gotcha.

670
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,100
>> You found out you
have hybrid children.

671
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,394
You're part of this program.

672
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,605
What is the program, if you can...

673
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,606
what's going on?

674
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,192
>> The program.

675
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,071
It's a program designed
to help wake up humanity.

676
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,158
>> OK, the program designed
to help wake up humanity.

677
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:17,458
>> And connect Earth with
its greater other aspects,

678
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
its galactic family.

679
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,881
So it's to merge galactic
family with the Earth family,

680
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,674
as well as wake up humanity.

681
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,635
And all those are waking
up humanity, that process.

682
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,680
>> So it's a
multi-level type program.

683
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,598
>> Yes.

684
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,642
There's many reasons to it, yes.

685
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,519
>> And one of them, which--

686
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,104
like I said, is the
first time I even

687
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,524
heard it put it that way,
to help wake up humanity.

688
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,902
And I can totally
see that happening.

689
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:49,574
But usually, it's perceived
in a negative context.

690
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,366
>> Yes.

691
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,786
It starts with like
the understanding

692
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,248
of maybe a negative context
through the abduction program,

693
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,126
which most people
know about, which

694
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:04,297
is a connection of
the Zeta Reticuli,

695
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,925
which is a parallel
reality human,

696
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:12,889
and also is part of our
original DNA strand in us,

697
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,973
which is kind of freaky.

698
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,352
So it's like they're
taking themselves,

699
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,438
because it's themselves
in another dimension,

700
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,858
as well as we have
that genetics in us.

701
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,735
So it's like taking family.

702
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,072
So it's much more
intertwined and at home

703
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:33,201
than seems to be some like
beings like from another world,

704
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,994
being like, aaaargh.

705
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,497
It's closer to home.

706
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,749
>> Right, but many aspects.

707
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,504
So it's multi-dimensional as far
as them being an aspect of us

708
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,546
having their DNA.

709
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,756
It's not just one thing.

710
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,799
>> Right.

711
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,300
>> Within that program--

712
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,595
>> --within that program,
within all of that stuff--

713
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,389
>> --intergalactic contact.

714
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,765
>> --that's gonna wake us up.

715
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,934
I mean, that's gonna jostle people.

716
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:03,064
That's gonna like set off every
trigger of the ego perceivable.

717
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:03,898
>> Well, it has.

718
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,820
I mean, if you talk to any of
the thousands of abductees--

719
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,574
hundreds of thousands,
and estimated millions--

720
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,452
then, it's rocked
some worlds out there.

721
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,163
>> Yeah, definitely
rocked some worlds.

722
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,457
>> Sounds like your world
was rocked a little bit too?

723
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,375
>> Rocked my world.

724
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,836
Changed my world.

725
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,798
And in the program,
which is commonly known,

726
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:35,430
semen and eggs, genetic material
is taken from these abductees.

727
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,809
And that is meant to create
other beings, meant to create

728
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,145
the five hybrid civilizations--

729
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,231
five different hybrid
civilizations-- as well as

730
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,985
the hybrid children, also
known as the freelancers.

731
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,112
And these particular
kids are the ones

732
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,530
going to be coming to Earth.

733
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,367
So it's five civilizations
that have their own planets,

734
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,788
have evolved on, as well as
these kids coming to Earth.

735
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:05,626
And all this has taken place in,
give or take, about a 100 year

736
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,961
period of Earth time.

737
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,795
>> Wow.

738
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,797
So, I mean, this is,

739
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,591
 hybrids from us, from humans.

740
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:16,679
So humanity is
responsible for kind

741
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,936
of igniting five other
civilizations on other planets?

742
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,771
>> Yeah.

743
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,938
They each have their own planet.

744
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,398
>> They each have
their own planet.

745
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,235
And so, wow, humans.

746
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,112
>> We're their ancestors.

747
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,197
>> And we don't even know.

748
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,156
>> No.

749
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,785
>> Our DNA is
seeding these others,

750
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,164
which makes you kind of think
how many other civilizations

751
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,373
seeded humanity?

752
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,503
>> Oh, I like that tie-in.

753
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:55,593
>> And if so, were those races
even aware or conscious that

754
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,347
they were seeding another
civilization at the time?

755
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,267
So that's the big
question you always

756
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,813
see on "Ancient Aliens" or something.
Are we - we're aliens!

757
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,439
You know, where do we come from?

758
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,108
The missing DNA chromosome.

759
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,861
We had a genetic
leap from the apes.

760
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,654
What is that?

761
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,405
Where did that come from?

762
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,490
>> Yeah.

763
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,325
We're hybrids.

764
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,620
And distinguishing that-- I
guess at this moment, is good--

765
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,374
is that we're all
hybrids, and that it's

766
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:33,172
a part of the greater galactic
story that we seed each other--

767
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,008
that we seed consciousness,
that we seed beings.

768
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:40,680
So say, the abduction program
taken just in that context,

769
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,514
it might seem weird.

770
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,351
But in a greater context, it's
like, well who seeded us?

771
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,939
And with that, to my
knowledge or what I've gotten,

772
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:54,152
is that there's seven different
extraterrestrial genetics that

773
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,572
are involved in
the seeding of us.

774
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,159
And that have then gone forward.

775
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,412
And so we have those
lineages in us.

776
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,205
And that's why our
genetic material

777
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,293
is awesome for the
Grays to utilize

778
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,379
in creating the hybrid
civilizations, as well

779
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,047
as the hybrid children.

780
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,173
>> So you mentioned Grays.

781
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:20,428
Let's just kind of
identify that a little bit.

782
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:26,142
Grays, meaning, is that the
typical term for the beings

783
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,435
from the Zeta Reticuli?

784
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,269
>> Yeah.

785
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,690
>> And that's mostly these
beings that you see in movies.

786
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,109
>> Yeah, big eyes, big heads.

787
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,360
There's a lot different kinds.

788
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,197
You know, there's ones that are
super negatively-oriented, ones

789
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,450
that have worked
with the government.

790
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,827
There's a few different
kinds, different timelines.

791
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,078
>> So we can say--

792
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,914
and I'm glad you mentioned that.

793
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,167
So we see these Gray
beings, doesn't necessarily

794
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,919
mean just like with humans,
we have different color skin

795
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,170
mean just like with humans,
we have different color skin

796
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,213
humans.

797
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:59,008
Not all the Grays-- even
though they may be grayish--

798
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,302
are there some brown Grays?

799
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,804
>> I think that they're
all pretty gray.

800
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,600
But they could have
different, say motivations

801
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,228
or different energies.

802
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,856
So there are some that are
like incredibly benevolent.

803
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,526
And then there's
some that have really

804
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,280
taken a turn based on
this hybrid program,

805
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,368
and come to a little bit
more of a balanced place.

806
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,330
>> So you think initially,
the ones before they engaged

807
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:36,921
into this hybridization
program, were maybe not as nice?

808
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,590
>> Well, there they're
fifth dimensional beings,

809
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,967
but they're negatively-oriented.

810
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,094
So they have all the technology.

811
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,972
They have of the
genetic know-how.

812
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,139
They have all of that.

813
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,683
But they are
negatively-oriented,

814
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,893
and they're more hive mentality.

815
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,937
And so at the beginning
of the program,

816
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,106
it was a lot more intense.

817
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,901
They didn't know how to work
with humans because they

818
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,862
genetically modified their
emotions out of themselves.

819
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:06,701
But through this program,
we sparked something in them

820
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:11,872
that made them, to the
best of their ability,

821
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,375
understand more of
the emotional body,

822
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,043
and start to
understand how to work

823
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:22,967
with us in a way that doesn't
completely freak us out.

824
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,847
>> So probably the abductions
that are happening now are less

825
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,475
aggressive, a little more
compassionate than maybe some

826
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,271
of the abductions that were
happening 10 or 20 years ago,

827
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,105
in the early days.

828
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:41,152
In the Benny and Barney
Hill, the Whitney Strieber

829
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,822
and some of these early records
that we have of this happening.

830
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,614
>> Exactly.

831
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,407
>> Interesting.

832
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,908
>> Yeah.

833
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,036
>> Are there still bad
ones out there, you think?

834
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,078
>> Yeah.

835
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,371
>> When we say bad?

836
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:56,292
You know, I mean like ones
that aren't as compassionate,

837
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,585
I would say, like that.

838
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,129
>> And for the most part, most
of the Zeta Reticuli have died off.

839
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:00,921
>>Interesting.

840
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:05,134
That's why there was an
urgency to do this, you know.

841
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:10,431
Because they couldn't reproduce.

842
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,560
And so they needed
a way to continue on,

843
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,147
in a way that was continuing
on with them, which is us,

844
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,356
in a different way.

845
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,817
So, yes.

846
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,194
>> Interesting.

847
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:31,327
So we've got more than five,
or around five races out there

848
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,872
with humans kind of
helping to seed that.

849
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,831
What's the next steps?

850
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,874
Where do we go from here?

851
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,876
>> The next steps.

852
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:45,299
The next steps are that
there's many different possible

853
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,843
timelines of what
is going to happen.

854
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,806
So then we get into more of
the timeline metaphysical

855
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:57,603
probability of someone's
personal incarnational choice.

856
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,856
And through that,
there's timelines.

857
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,944
Because right now is when the
Grays split off from human.

858
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,738
This is like us right
now, in the future,

859
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:12,076
in a certain timeline
became a Gray.

860
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,578
Genetically modified
ourselves, went underground

861
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:19,083
in underground tunnels and,
like, evolved in a certain way,

862
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,502
with focus on the
intellect versus emotion.

863
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,338
>> Did they say why they went
to the underground tunnels?

864
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,924
>> Well, because they started
destroying the planet too much.

865
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,469
But my personal opinion is
that it's like the government

866
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,346
underground scenario.

867
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,016
So it's kind of future
government ended up

868
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,434
becoming that.

869
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,688
It's my own kind of take on it.

870
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,189
>> So Grays are humans?

871
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,943
>> Yeah, but just mutated
humans from a different parallel

872
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,362
reality Earth.

873
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,614
So it's not necessarily
like this Earth, you know?

874
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,825
>> So if you go
out to outer space,

875
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,286
you end up bumping
into Earth again?

876
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,788
>> Could be, in a
future timeline.

877
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,291
I mean, it's all so
intertwined, you know?

878
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,169
>> It's kind of starting to
make sense to me a little bit.

879
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,420
I'm seeing different things.

880
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,671
I'm hearing different things.

881
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,632
But we'll let the audience
decide if it makes sense

882
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,925
to them or not.

883
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,636
But I mean, that
totally makes sense.

884
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,638
You know, you have the
whole Denver airport

885
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,725
big underground
tunnel thing, with all

886
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:22,313
the craziness and
underground dulce.

887
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,483
And you have all of
this stuff, you know?

888
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:29,487
And George Bush buying up
all the mountains in Europe,

889
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,949
and like building
caves and caverns.

890
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:38,579
So I can see how
humanity could have gone,

891
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,664
or still, I guess,
could go that direction.

892
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,041
>> Yeah.

893
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,918
And then the other one,
the other direction--

894
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,919
>> The other direction--

895
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,546
>> --which is my
direction, my focus,

896
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:53,677
I would say your focus too,
is the complete and utter

897
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,013
transformation into
the fifth dimension,

898
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:01,769
and the shifting of Earth
to a healed space and like

899
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,605
a united humanity and oneness.

900
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,566
And galactic contact.

901
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,859
So that is the other timeline.

902
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,527
>> So they kind of saw,

903
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,655
since they lived that
timeline, they kind of saw

904
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,324
OK, this is what happens
if we make these choices

905
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,534
and we live in this timeline.

906
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,326
>> Yes.

907
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:22,623
>> So let's go back, and let's
tell ourselves a different

908
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,916
story.

909
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,126
And let's create a
different future,

910
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,671
because living in
underground tunnels

911
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,882
because the world's too
toxic to live in, sucks.

912
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,716
>> Yeah.

913
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,009
It doesn't end up working.

914
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,304
>> Interesting.

915
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,266
>> It hits me really deep
to think that the most kind

916
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,518
of negative-- like, it's
like, oh, the government, oh,

917
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,477
Monsanto--

918
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,772
that they end up
going so far down

919
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:51,777
into the depths of
darkness, that they end up

920
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,030
coming back full
circle, which is

921
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,201
a beautiful exercise in, like,
darkness to light, you know?

922
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,120
And a different
perspective on looking

923
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,290
at this simultaneous
government that we see.

924
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,960
All of the realities are,
like, all jumbled right now.

925
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,795
And then they'll
start breaking off.

926
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,880
But right now, it's like, OK.

927
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm like, wow.

928
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,133
The chemtrails.

929
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,594
Like, you end up saving me,
like, in a different version,

930
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:18,429
you know?

931
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:23,225
And so it puts it
into perspective.

932
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,018
>> Yes.

933
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,854
Many different perspectives,
but yes, a perspective.

934
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,230
>> It puts it into
a perspective.

935
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,773
>> It does put it
into a perspective.

936
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,276
You have a little mothy thing.

937
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,944
There we go.

938
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,112
It's your friend.

939
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:35,946
Hi, friend.

940
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,364
OK, now you can
come say hi to me.

941
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,240
Thank you.

942
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,366
OK.

943
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,161
Do we just keep going?

944
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,287
>> Yeah.

945
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,497
[LAUGHS]

946
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:49,001
So getting back to
the hybrid children--

947
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,046
because that's your
focus right now--

948
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:57,885
can you tell us how that
started, and where are we at?

949
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,472
Catch us up to speed with
the whole children project.

950
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,643
>> Well, how it started was
through the mixing of the DNA

951
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,894
in the abduction program.

952
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,980
So they would use
the human genetics,

953
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,817
and then mix it with the Gray
genetics, do their stuff,

954
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,487
and then create
these kids from that.

955
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,238
And there's been
different generations.

956
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:22,159
The first ones were very
sickly and didn't make it.

957
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,413
The later ones did make
it and are thriving.

958
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,540
>> And what was the
reason for not making it?

959
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,629
>> The reason for not making
it was the lack of humanity.

960
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,923
>> The lack of humanity?

961
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,633
>> The lack of
nurture, you know?

962
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:44,306
It's this idea that science
and genetics, and even

963
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,016
their energetic
know-how of, like,

964
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:51,480
creating an energetic template
vessel for incarnation,

965
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,774
they could do all of that stuff.

966
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,069
But when it came down
to it, these kids

967
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,571
couldn't make it
because of a lack

968
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:05,202
of this missing link of
love, of like emotion

969
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,161
and of connection.

970
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,456
>> So literally, they went
so far in their intellect,

971
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,126
that their lack
of emotions has--

972
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,132
it's like the missing link
that they still, even that far

973
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,968
advanced, even
that far evolved--

974
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,012
thousands, if not millions
of years in the future--

975
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,599
they're missing
the one component

976
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,686
that we all know creates life.

977
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,854
Doesn't matter--

978
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,355
>> --what planet.

979
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,858
>> --what planet we're in,
what religion I guess you are,

980
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,861
from what part of
humanity you're from.

981
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,989
But we all know in
every movie, that's

982
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,325
the big lesson in everything
in all of our stories,

983
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,203
and our religions, and
our science fiction.

984
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,538
Everything is love.

985
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,874
It's all about love.

986
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,793
So that's the missing link.

987
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,919
>> That's the missing link.

988
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,171
>> --that they have forgotten.

989
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,131
>> Yeah.

990
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,716
And the human mothers--

991
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,845
there were some human mothers
amongst the fearful scenario

992
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,681
of being abducted--
could maintain

993
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:12,895
this love for their
alien mutated child.

994
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:17,107
And nurture them to the degree
that they could thrive--

995
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:21,278
well, could survive, and
then eventually thrive.

996
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,323
And so that altered the race.

997
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,492
And it also altered--

998
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,953
I mean, that was a big
shift, I think, even

999
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:34,249
in the human collective,
to be able to love.

1000
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,878
I mean, it is your offspring,
but to love something alien,

1001
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,670
you know?

1002
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,507
And it's this mixing
that's happening.

1003
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:46,094
And much of this is happening
in the sub and unconscious.

1004
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,472
It's like hidden away memories.

1005
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,267
But it is shifting
and now translating

1006
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,604
into the collective
consciousness

1007
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,772
in a really powerful way.

1008
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,398
>> I'm just going to
mention something.

1009
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,943
So actually, I
recently saw TED Talks

1010
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,655
of this autistic boy
who-- or at least, he

1011
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,490
was diagnosed with autism.

1012
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,493
And he got over his autism.

1013
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,539
And I'll put a link
into this video here.

1014
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:18,794
But he actually was able to
overcome his autism by love--

1015
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,003
his parents loving him.

1016
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:24,883
It wasn't any kind of superfood
or anything that they gave him.

1017
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,095
He says, I got
over the hardships

1018
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:33,225
I had because of my
parents taking the time

1019
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,143
to spend the time with
me, and be with me,

1020
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,688
and nurture me, and love me.

1021
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,943
And that's what healed these
autistic traits that he had.

1022
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:43,735
>> Jeez.

1023
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,862
>> And there's
videos of him, like--

1024
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,697
it was hardcore.

1025
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,614
It was messed up.

1026
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,116
>> That's amazing.

1027
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:49,867
>> So it makes sense.

1028
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:50,659
>> Yeah.

1029
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,328
>> Yeah, it's great.

1030
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,914
So now, these
children are thriving.

1031
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,459
And what's going on?

1032
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,377
What are they saying?

1033
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:06,008
>> Well, so now, they're
energetically and physically

1034
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,928
connected to their
parents, which are us--

1035
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,513
who are us.

1036
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:18,770
And it is their sole motivation
to telepathically just inundate

1037
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:23,775
us with these memories, and to
connect with us in dream time,

1038
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:30,991
and to also just implant in
us this reality that we've

1039
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,701
chosen to go towards.

1040
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,288
It's like, OK, go more
in this direction.

1041
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,581
Go more in this direction.

1042
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,834
So they're really,
right now, our guides--

1043
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,752
>> Yeah, OK.

1044
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,047
>> --back to ourselves.

1045
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,508
>> You know, I'm just thinking
about the first humans

1046
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:53,347
to arrive on Earth, if
they came to this planet

1047
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,807
in a similar-type fashion.

1048
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,101
I wonder if there was
that kind of connection

1049
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:03,815
to their home world that
they had to come in and--

1050
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,860
I'm just trying
to imagine trying

1051
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,862
to bring it home, in some way.

1052
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:13,408
So if we can imagine
Earth and humans,

1053
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,994
these first hybrid
humans being here

1054
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,206
and still having,
energetically, their parents

1055
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,417
off world on another planet,
and how that connection would

1056
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,338
happen, it doesn't seem that
far out when you start to think

1057
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,090
of it in those aspects.

1058
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,466
>> Well, and it
is close to home.

1059
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,301
I mean, we're in Sedona.

1060
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:35,097
But the Phoenix
Lights '97, right?

1061
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,182
Shalanaya mother
ship came over--

1062
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,266
>> Wait, Shala--

1063
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,101
>> Shalanaya.

1064
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,561
That's the first hybrid race.

1065
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,355
And they'll be the
first ones to land.

1066
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,147
>> Oh, wow.

1067
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,441
>> The first hybrid race,
but the hybrid kids will be

1068
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:51,571
the first to contact beings.

1069
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:55,867
And the hybrid kids
are on that ship.

1070
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,620
Like, some of them live
on that actual ship.

1071
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,998
And then Shalanaya
ships have actually

1072
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,794
been seen on this property
by one of my good friends.

1073
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:10,966
And so the kids, I mean,
they're right there, you know?

1074
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:16,471
I mean, it's like they're
on an airplane or something.

1075
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,599
Ah, behind the tree.

1076
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,601
I can picture.

1077
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,019
>> Peeking around
the corner, hey.

1078
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:23,812
>> Yeah.

1079
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,604
>> Go back to bed.

1080
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,439
[LAUGHS]

1081
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,358
How does this story end?

1082
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:32,195
>> The story ends, well,
kind of how it begins.

1083
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,073
Well, you can see how it
ends by the trajectory of how

1084
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:40,746
it has started, that
I was told that I confirmed

1085
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,956
that I have hybrid kids.

1086
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,209
And after that session,
about three hybrid moms

1087
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,836
came up to me.

1088
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,380
And they already knew
that they had kids.

1089
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,550
And at that time, it
was very like, whisper

1090
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,718
about having hybrid kids.

1091
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,387
It was very like,
tucked away and not

1092
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,391
really outspoken about this.

1093
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,311
And there were maybe
like different abductees

1094
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,187
who knew about it.

1095
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,899
But it wasn't like a
known out there thing.

1096
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,610
And that next day,

1097
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,905
it became very clear
that my soul's dedication

1098
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:19,826
was to make the
hybrid children known.

1099
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,870
And so for the rest
of that summer,

1100
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,623
I didn't do anything else.

1101
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,917
I stopped all other work.

1102
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,921
And I just started
creating the hybrid website

1103
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,838
for the community.

1104
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,757
And I started
connecting with my kids,

1105
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,842
because I couldn't
connect with anyone else.

1106
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,761
I didn't even know that
I was going to connect

1107
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,012
other people to their kids.

1108
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,305
I didn't know that.

1109
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:43,016
All I was starting
with was, like, OK.

1110
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,309
I'm the parent.

1111
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,686
I'm going to start
connecting with my children.

1112
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:52,275
And I wanted a space to
be made for other parents

1113
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:57,114
to have this be known, and
for it to be findable-- like,

1114
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,200
for it to be known in that way.

1115
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,327
And then later, I
found out that I

1116
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,954
was designed to do that,

1117
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,331
that there would be those 
online platforms

1118
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:06,998
that people would come to.

1119
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:07,791
>> Interesting.

1120
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,667
>> Yeah.

1121
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,960
So then, it started.

1122
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,424
And then, the first month, it
was like 100 unique visits.

1123
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,552
>> 100 unique visits?

1124
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,761
>> Per month, to the website.

1125
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,554
>> Oh, I see.

1126
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,764
>> Just very, very small.

1127
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:26,852
And within a year,
it hit 20,000.

1128
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,356
So in one year, hybrid alien
children went to 20,000.

1129
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,440
And now--

1130
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,942
>> Is this the Facebook page?

1131
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:34,943
>> This is the website.

1132
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,444
>> The actual website, OK.

1133
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,446
>> So it's like
exponential growth.

1134
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,157
>> I'll put a link in
here for everybody,

1135
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,616
so they can see that.

1136
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,492
Insert link.

1137
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,702
>> Yeah.

1138
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,955
So it's the exponential growth
has been the fascinating thing

1139
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,375
for me to watch,
and how a few emails

1140
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,793
trickle in here and there.

1141
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:56,047
And then it's just like,
I'm inundated every day

1142
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,299
with people messaging me.

1143
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,677
And so the wake up
process and the next step,

1144
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,306
as you were asking, is that
people are gonna remember.

1145
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,600
People are gonna have
dreams about these kids.

1146
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,978
People are gonna have
memories about all of this.

1147
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:15,692
Know the next stages of moving,
of the assimilation of moving

1148
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,152
to these sacred sites.

1149
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,154
All of this
information is coming

1150
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,906
and is already happening.

1151
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,824
And I see these people.

1152
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,703
It's amping up in the collective
in such a big and powerful way.

1153
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,916
It's really fun and crazy
for even me to watch.

1154
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,918
Like, I didn't know
where this was going.

1155
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,211
And so I'm just kind of--

1156
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:39,799
I'm the driver, but I'm
also like the observer.

1157
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,509
>> Absolutely.

1158
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,012
It's great to acknowledge that.

1159
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,765
So your work right
now is in addition

1160
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,684
to working with
your own children,

1161
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:54,064
you're kind of this
conduit, this go-to person

1162
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:58,526
for people to connect.

1163
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,612
And how do you explain
your work in that sense?

1164
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,449
How do you help people connect
with their hybrid children?

1165
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,578
>> I help them
connect by, I guess,

1166
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:13,458
you can picture it as like a
cord, like a plug-in cord--

1167
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,335
that, like, I have the cord.

1168
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,546
And I just, like,
plug it in to them.

1169
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,257
And somehow, I was
given the cord.

1170
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,676
And it's a kind of
a hard cord to find

1171
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,011
because it's deeply
buried in the subconscious

1172
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,304
and unconscious.

1173
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,099
So I just connect it.

1174
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,519
So there's an energetic
cording that I connect,

1175
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,190
that is more of like
a astral activity.

1176
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,026
I don't do it consciously,
but it just happens.

1177
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,405
And then I also bring through--

1178
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,616
I get the clairvoyant
image of the child.

1179
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,787
Or they talk to me through
all the different senses

1180
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,746
that I perceive.

1181
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,709
And I deliver whatever messages,
deliver about their essence,

1182
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,210
deliver their image--

1183
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,212
whatever the parent
needs to know that's

1184
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:02,173
going to benefit them in the
next stage of their connection

1185
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,758
with their child.

1186
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,385
That's what I bring through.

1187
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,177
>> Excellent.

1188
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,139
And for every person, it's a
different message, I assume.

1189
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:09,931
>> Yeah.

1190
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,642
It's very different,
and it could be things

1191
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,812
that they might
not want to hear.

1192
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,065
>> Well, for example,
has anybody not received

1193
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,485
the information very well?

1194
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,405
In what case when you say,
not what they want to hear?

1195
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:31,161
>> Well, I guess, maybe
that wasn't even accurate.

1196
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,871
Because every person--

1197
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:37,751
I've probably done about
50 in the past few years.

1198
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,545
And every person
has completely--

1199
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,548
like, it's really hit
them on a very deep level.

1200
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,718
And they've all resonated.

1201
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,928
Maybe the not what
they want to hear

1202
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:55,393
is the shifting that they need
to do to be able to meet them.

1203
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,897
Because it's not like you can
just stay at your 9:00 to 5:00

1204
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,734
job, like, chowing down
on a burger, and, like,

1205
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,737
they're going to move into
your house in the neighborhood.

1206
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,948
>> So, explain, for example,
what are some of the shifts

1207
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,325
that need to take place?

1208
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,410
>> Some of the shifts that
need to take place are,

1209
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,664
one is for the human parents
to follow their excitement--

1210
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,626
to, like, really align
themselves with their passion.

1211
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
Because only in
that state will they

1212
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,924
be able to shift to where
they can actually meet them.

1213
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:32,222
So one is the transition to
having them be more themselves,

1214
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,391
which is a lot.

1215
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,852
In some cases, it could be
visiting certain places,

1216
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,563
that they need to go visit
certain places to make

1217
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,606
a certain connection.

1218
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,192
They might need to
go to a sacred site.

1219
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:48,988
They might need to move
to a different place.

1220
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,658
>> And the children actually
come through and say this?

1221
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,700
>> Yeah, in some cases.

1222
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,124
I use my own filter
in the way of knowing

1223
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,250
how much is too much.

1224
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,627
Because the kid would
push them all the way.

1225
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,296
The kid is like, go, you know?

1226
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,799
>> You look at the person and
you're like, where they're at.

1227
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,467
And you're like, OK,
are they resonating

1228
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,385
with this information?

1229
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,011
Or are they are they
taking steps back?

1230
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,804
>> Yeah.

1231
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:16,224
So I give as much as
is going to be helpful.

1232
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,643
Because if say, like,
give up your whole life

1233
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,603
and go to Tibet--

1234
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,731
>> Then they're going to throw
the whole out not listen to any

1235
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,149
of it.

1236
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:24,524
>> Exactly.

1237
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,775
And the kid understands that.

1238
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:30,363
And I have dialogues
with them too.

1239
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,241
>> Do they knock on your
door afterwards and say,

1240
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,492
why didn't you tell them this?

1241
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,076
Or, why didn't you
tell them that?

1242
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,411
And then you say,
well, because this.

1243
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,287
And they say, oh, OK.

1244
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,705
Do you do have those kind of?

1245
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,289
>> Kind of, yeah.

1246
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,206
>> The kind of
conversation, how it goes?

1247
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,166
>> Yeah.

1248
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,418
So I'll give you a scenario.

1249
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,253
One of my childhood friends--

1250
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,631
well, our families
were friends, I

1251
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,092
met him maybe once
when I was, like, five.

1252
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,510
And I never met
him, but we always

1253
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,554
knew about each
other-- similar age.

1254
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,724
And he's an artist
too, very creative.

1255
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,977
And finally, there was something
when this hybrid children

1256
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:01,811
thing started.

1257
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,105
It was like, you need
to go back to Utah

1258
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:11,112
and connect with this guy that
I had never met in person.

1259
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,198
And so we connected.

1260
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:19,162
And within 10 minutes, he starts
telling me about these things--

1261
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,623
abduction experiences that
started happening right

1262
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,832
when he hit puberty.

1263
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,667
I'm like, OK.

1264
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,752
I knew that.

1265
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,047
And I very quickly
heard and felt

1266
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,175
that he had these hybrid
kids, and that we particularly

1267
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,343
had hybrid kids together.

1268
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,969
And we were just
friends and stuff,

1269
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,805
but they used our genetic
material together.

1270
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:42,185
And so then I told him about
the hybrid kids and stuff.

1271
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,521
But I didn't tell him
that I felt that yet.

1272
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,022
It wasn't time.

1273
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,523
And so I went back to LA.

1274
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:52,070
And I actually channeled the
kids that I saw that were ours.

1275
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,905
And there was a boy and a girl.

1276
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,573
And then I went back
two weeks later,

1277
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,785
and he said that since
he had been around me,

1278
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,955
he had been having these
experiences at night where

1279
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:06,376
these two kids would come
and knock on his door.

1280
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,629
And every night
that week, his dog

1281
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,548
had been needing
to go out at night.

1282
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:16,636
And he would go into
this kind of dream state.

1283
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:21,140
And these kids, like,
who he was terrified of,

1284
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,350
would just knock on his door.

1285
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,978
And he had these dreams
of, like, pushing the door

1286
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,981
shut as these kids
were trying to get in.

1287
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,608
And it was like,
no, don't come in.

1288
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,903
And at that same time right
before I knew that in LA,

1289
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,572
I tried to tune into the kids.

1290
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,116
And they were like, we don't
need to be with you, Mom.

1291
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,993
Like, we need to
take care of Dad.

1292
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:40,785
>> Oh, wow.

1293
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,121
>> So all of this was happening.

1294
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,872
And like, it was
confirmed by him.

1295
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:48,001
So there are some people
that, they're just like--

1296
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,168
>> They're not ready for it.

1297
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,211
>> No.

1298
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,045
No, you know?

1299
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:57,093
>> Well, after our session,
it's a lot to throw on you.

1300
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:02,181
It's like all day yesterday,
I kept talking to Daniel--

1301
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,892
my cameraman here--
about, like, yeah.

1302
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,145
Maybe I don't know if
I'm ready for real kids

1303
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,479
here in this third dimension.

1304
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,816
But I might be ready for--

1305
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,650
>> --for an alien.

1306
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,277
>> --for an alien kid.

1307
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,737
[LAUGHS]

1308
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,197
As crazy as that sounds.

1309
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:22,619
So yeah, I guess most people
would kind of the other way

1310
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,579
around.

1311
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,583
Even if you had regular
kids on this dimension,

1312
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,919
even contemplating another
kid, that's like a major--

1313
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:32,795
>> It's a major thing.

1314
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,131
>> That's a thing
that you just, like--

1315
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,092
I don't need that
worry/responsibility.

1316
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,345
But it sounds like
these kids can kind of

1317
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,346
take care of themselves.

1318
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:45,224
If they're guiding us along,
they're more of the parents,

1319
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:53,107
and we're the kids,
in many aspects.

1320
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:57,445
But do they have basic needs?

1321
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,072
Do they need to
be potty trained?

1322
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,158
How does that work?

1323
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,203
>> Their caretakers, the
other ETs that they're with,

1324
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,872
they're taking care of them.

1325
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,833
>> They're getting them up
to speed with how to lift up

1326
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,668
the toilet seat.

1327
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,585
>> Yeah.

1328
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,961
They're being trained for Earth.

1329
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,505
That's their classroom.

1330
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,884
So they don't go to school, they
go to like Earth 101, yeah.

1331
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,346
>> Which I've actually talked
to several abductees who--

1332
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,641
>> --the classroom?

1333
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,059
>> --or even, yeah,
the classroom.

1334
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,811
And they're on ships.

1335
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,772
And they see classrooms
where they're

1336
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,525
teaching them how to buy
stuff at the supermarket.

1337
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:41,531
And it's like-- and I heard that
like three to five years ago,

1338
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:45,660
abductees talking about
this and having the same.

1339
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,037
And it's not just one, but
several of these abductees

1340
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,247
saying, hey, I was on a ship,

1341
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,415
and I saw that too.

1342
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,125
And that's so bizarre.

1343
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,668
What does that mean?

1344
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,128
It means there's
something coming.

1345
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:55,753
>> Right.

1346
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,546
>> Right.

1347
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,550
So it looks like all the dots
are getting connected here.

1348
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,509
Something's coming.

1349
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:01,759
>> Yeah.

1350
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,010
>> So is that what's
going to happen?

1351
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,095
Are they going to join us?

1352
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,140
You said they're in another
dimension on another planet.

1353
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,724
Are they going to join us here?

1354
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:09,559
>> Yes, they are.

1355
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,601
>> That's the grand plan.

1356
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,605
The Freelancers are going
to join us on Earth.

1357
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,942
So the other civilizations,
they're on their civilizations.

1358
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:22,989
But there were kids that were
held out of time, in a sense.

1359
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,407
So they're not aging.

1360
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,368
They're just, like,
held in time--

1361
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:32,373
continuing on, but they're going
to be inserted into our reality

1362
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,250
when the time is right.

1363
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,087
And they will be introduced
to Earth as our children.

1364
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:43,634
And they will be the
first step and conduit

1365
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:48,222
into contact with
other civilizations.

1366
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:52,101
>> Right, which makes it a
little easier on humanity

1367
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:56,773
if there's an actual
alien that is part human--

1368
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,690
>> --and their child.

1369
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,649
>> --and their child.

1370
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,609
>> --and is a child.

1371
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,067
>> --and is a child.

1372
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,986
So you're not going to
blow it out of the sky,

1373
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,488
or we're being
attacked by aliens!

1374
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,698
How can kids be attacking us?

1375
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,283
>> Right.

1376
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,994
Unless they're maybe perceived
through a negative filter,

1377
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:12,330
which would be the
Black Eyed children.

1378
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,916
>> OK, I'm glad you
brought that up.

1379
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,001
Because I was thinking
of bringing that up,

1380
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:20,630
but I didn't want to bring any
negativity into this session.

1381
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,759
So, Black Eyed children.

1382
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,677
What are they?

1383
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,595
>> Well, I mean--

1384
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,847
>> People can go online and
search all the Black Eyed

1385
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:30,640
children stuff.

1386
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,476
But what is your interpretation?

1387
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:37,563
>> I think it is my belief
that Black Eyed children are

1388
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:41,734
a hybrid children perceived
through a negative ego filter.

1389
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:46,656
There could be some
freak creepy children

1390
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,033
coming into this dimension
or something that

1391
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,409
are Black Eyed children too.

1392
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,954
But after hearing that
experience with the guy

1393
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,831
that I just told you
about, that the kids are

1394
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,751
knocking on his door, and he
perceived their eyes as black--

1395
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,879
like black kind of scary eyes--

1396
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,465
and I'm going, OK, I
know where his ego is at.

1397
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,844
He does not want
to look at this.

1398
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,430
And then he is then perceiving
them as super creepy

1399
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,182
and super scary.

1400
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,061
And so I'm going, yeah.

1401
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,856
Like, I'm thinking
that that is--

1402
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,692
>> So the Black Eyed children
aren't necessarily negative,

1403
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,860
it's the people who are
perceiving them have those

1404
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,698
negative projections
that are giving to them.

1405
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,826
So therefore, they're
telling the world,

1406
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,327
I don't want you
to open the door.

1407
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,370
They're going to come in.

1408
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,624
And they're going to kill
you and cut you to pieces,

1409
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,835
and put you in the freezer.

1410
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,545
[LAUGHS]

1411
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,048
Sorry, so don't do it.

1412
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,675
Don't open the door.

1413
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:52,388
Even though they're like
kind of cute and they need

1414
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:57,727
help, and they're super
pysch, and everything else.

1415
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,894
But they need your blood.

1416
01:04:58,894 --> 01:04:59,729
>> Yeah.

1417
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,105
>> They're going
to suck you dry.

1418
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,064
[LAUGHS]

1419
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,111
Because that's how, typically,
the Black Eyed children

1420
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,446
are perceived, in a lot of ways.

1421
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,780
>> They are.

1422
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,035
And maybe there are
creepy, like-- you know,

1423
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,871
there are dark energies and
spirits that I've worked with.

1424
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,498
>> You think of maybe a few in
the first batch didn't quite go

1425
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:19,957
a certain way?

1426
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:20,750
>> Maybe.

1427
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,293
Yeah, they dropped them off.

1428
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,670
And they're like, let's just
make this a horror show.

1429
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,423
>> Yeah, let's just throw
them back at the parents.

1430
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,215
Let's not deal.

1431
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,800
So even up in the
craft, they're like,

1432
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,844
we can't deal with these kids.

1433
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,388
>> Genetic experiment
went wrong.

1434
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:37,141
>> We gotta drop those humans--

1435
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:41,187
yeah, especially the ones
that really aren't accepting

1436
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,355
this information very much.

1437
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,566
Let's just give
them a little taste.

1438
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,943
>> Maybe.

1439
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,735
I mean--

1440
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:48,653
>> Oh my goodness.

1441
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,487
>> Who knows?

1442
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,407
>> Thank you.

1443
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,702
I like that perspective on
the Black Eyed children.

1444
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,412
It kind of makes sense.

1445
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:01,040
So this other guy
you're talking about,

1446
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,126
his perception was kind of the
standard Black Eyed children

1447
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:04,919
perception?

1448
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:05,419
>> Yeah, it was.

1449
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,629
That's how he described it.

1450
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,673
>> But you, at the same
time, were getting direct

1451
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:14,637
communication from them saying,
we just want to communicate.

1452
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:19,350
>> And like, darling
energies, you know?

1453
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,434
Like, really sweet.

1454
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:24,021
And I know dark
energies, you know?

1455
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,232
I used to clear
poltergeists in houses.

1456
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,693
Like, I'm OK with that energy.

1457
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,695
And if it was that, that's cool.

1458
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,154
I'd honor that, you know?

1459
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,447
But it isn't.

1460
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,783
But in some cases,
maybe, you know?

1461
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,284
Like we said, it's a little--

1462
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,955
>> I mean, and even if it is,
I think you can transmute it

1463
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,039
in a sense by--

1464
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,750
again, we create
our own realities

1465
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,585
with wherever we
project on whatever it

1466
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,461
is we're going to do.

1467
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,879
So if we're going
to project that,

1468
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,007
we're going to create
that in our own heads,

1469
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,633
even if it's not really that.

1470
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:53,634
And same thing.

1471
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,886
It could be totally negative,
and you can transmute it

1472
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,763
to something positive.

1473
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,223
And that's a good thing.

1474
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,892
I don't see anything negative
with transforming the negative

1475
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:02,518
into positive.

1476
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,310
>> Right.

1477
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,231
>> So even if these demon
kids, black eyes, fangs,

1478
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,441
and blood sucking--

1479
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,360
even if you did show
love and compassion,

1480
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:16,032
you can still transmute
it into something lovely.

1481
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:16,824
>> Yes.

1482
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,869
>> So there is no negative.

1483
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,537
Even if it's negative,
you can still

1484
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,747
transmute it into a positive.

1485
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:27,334
So whichever scenario you go
down, why not open your arms

1486
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,503
and give these kids a big hug?

1487
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:34,050
>> And a cup of juice.

1488
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,426
>> And a cup of juice.

1489
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,510
A cup of juice.

1490
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,470
Every child--

1491
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,971
>> I was going to
say glass of milk,

1492
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,806
but we're going away from--

1493
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,475
we're going to go
with a glass of juice.

1494
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,393
>> Glass of juice.

1495
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,020
Not from concentrate.

1496
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,605
>> Not from concentrate, fresh.

1497
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,397
>> Fresh juice.

1498
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,190
>> We can do that.

1499
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,942
>> Non-pasteurized, very good.

1500
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:52,735
>> Organic.

1501
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,153
>> Organic juice.

1502
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:54,987
I like that.

1503
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:55,821
Cool.

1504
01:07:55,821 --> 01:08:00,284
Well, that's a lot
of information,

1505
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,578
and a lot to chew on.

1507
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,083
It might be a good
place to wrap this up.

01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,292
Thank you very much, Bridget.

see how this develops
