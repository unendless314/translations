1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,887
It is the idea of many of 
our species...

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,224
What we would say in 
other star systems 

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,768
coming into understanding 
that there is a balance

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,980
and so we allow all to 
happen the way it is 

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,149
and to interact the way it will be.

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,236
Otherwise we ourselves 
cannot expand if we do not

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,155
understand one another's 
perspectives.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,701
 We, or the Anunnaki 

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,536
the creators, are expanding 

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,164
in just the same as 
human consciousness is,

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,917
and that was previously misunderstood.

12
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,685
Living in

13
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,605
this third density has been 
beneficial for your learning

14
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,774
because now you can 
become the teachers,

15
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,943
and expand even more fully 
into the source energy 

16
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,196
that we are all trying to

17
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,031
what you might say 
make sense of 

18
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,866
or understand within 
our hearts.

19
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,287
Because you see that 
there is a paradigm 

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,247
allowed here on Earth, 

21
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,334
or a sort of "Game Shift",

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,420
you understand 

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,007
perhaps the mindsets 
that can trap you into 

24
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,883
that space.

25
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:37,597
There are others elsewhere 
that have fairly similar mindsets,

26
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:42,310
perhaps you can be their guides 
and teach them ways to expand 

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,522
past what you call "The Matrix" 
to "The Game Playing" 

28
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,065
but how would you know 

29
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,652
if you hadn't had some of 
that in your perspective?

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,291
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

31
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,709
life elsewhere in the universe?

32
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,588
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

33
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,924
My name is Reuben Langdon.

34
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:17,303
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

35
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,432
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

36
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,934
Coincidentally, I was working on

37
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,186
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

38
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,523
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

39
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,484
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

40
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,195
...are they here with us?

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,703
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,538
...what is their purpose?

43
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,249
Why don't they make themselves more known?

44
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,459
Why the secrecy?

45
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,712
I've asked these questions to many experts,

46
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,381
yet each seems to have a different theory.

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,842
So I thought to myself, 

48
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,428
why not ask the aliens directly?

49
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,471
So that's what I set out to do!

50
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,848
Well, sort of...

51
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,800
>> OK.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,138
So I have a few visuals.

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,977
I feel like my strongest one
is a woman from the council,

54
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:37,360
as well as, I would
say, an insectoid.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,653
>> OK.

56
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,114
>> I would say Gray,
but it's tall, skinny,

57
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,742
and it has more
of antenna-style,

58
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,079
instead of a human face,
if that makes sense.

59
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,163
>> Mm-hm.

60
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,542
Maybe closer to a Mantis?

61
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,795
>> Yeah, similar to
that type of breed,

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,007
or if that's what you call it?

63
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,466
So depending on
the question, those

64
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,760
are the two collectives
that want to answer.

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,976
OK, so depending on how
far back or what question,

66
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,312
the Draco also wants to respond.

67
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:19,861
He says, most particularly, if
he references the shift over,

68
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,362
which-- what we
were talking about,

69
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,531
when the beings came
in and basically took

70
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,786
over our consciousness, he knows
a lot about that time period.

71
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,912
>> OK.

72
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,498
Well, let's start with Atlantis.

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,249
>> OK.

74
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,877
>> And I hate to put
a timeline on things,

75
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,838
but I'm guessing around
25,000 years ago?

76
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,673
>> OK.

77
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,469
OK, so the woman says further
back than that, my love,

78
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,262
but yes.

79
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,473
A very special
time period indeed.

80
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,767
What is it that you
would like to know?

81
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,563
>> Is that-- because I've heard
from other channels and other

82
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,901
guides that humanity
carries a lot of trauma from

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,736
the Atlantean periods.

84
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,489
So I guess my
question would be, is

85
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,284
much of what we're dealing
with on the planet now,

86
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,913
is it tied into the
Atlantean energy?

87
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:16,334
>> She says, I'm not sure
if I would call it traumas,

88
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,671
though it does take some healing
to transform what has been

89
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,217
learned during this time
period and where you are moving

90
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,468
toward.

91
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,971
She says, you see, during
the Atlantean time period,

92
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,766
consciousness had
grown exponentially

93
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,560
and experiments
were taking place.

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,938
And yes, humanity as
well as other species

95
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:42,777
had to learn that this is not
how expansion was to occur

96
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,655
in the most beneficial way.

97
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,491
So those that
understood this opted

98
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,745
into a alternative experience--

99
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,247
an experience where
they could learn

100
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,415
in a slightly different way.

101
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,626
So you may call it
traumatic in the sense

102
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:03,339
that what once was known
was erased or taken,

103
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,718
but we would also like to
call it a teaching or learning

104
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:13,558
opportunity for the expansion of
humanity that they opted into.

105
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,979
>> Was the Annunaki
DNA injection,

106
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,818
was that prior or after
the Atlantean experience?

107
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,194
In our linear sense of time.

108
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,701
>> She says, right prior to
the diluvian time period with

109
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,581
the Annunaki, but there seems
to be a disconnect with what

110
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,332
she's showing me.

111
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,168
I'm seeing if she
can use verbals.

112
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,505
Basically, there seemed to be
an Atlantean time period further

113
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,841
back from when the
Annunaki actually came

114
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,510
and created their hybrid human.

115
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,850
And then she's showing me
that, with the diluvian waters,

116
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,895
they erased all of this.

117
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,523
But some Annunaki saved
some of the humanoid

118
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:07,069
to carry on that genetic
map that they created.

119
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,114
>> When you say "diluvian," can
you go into more detail about

120
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:10,907
that?

121
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,741
What does that mean?

122
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,703
>> She says the great flood
that we have known to be called

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,246
the great flood.

124
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,792
She says, this is a common
misconception in understanding

125
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,338
the human evolution,
because there were humanoids

126
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,798
in the Atlantean
time period, but we

127
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,177
would suggest that they were
more 5th dimensional beings.

128
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,055
They were not essentially
what the human is today.

129
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,140
That human is the
creation of what

130
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:43,064
the Annunaki created right prior
to this diluvian time period.

131
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,026
>> But the Annunaki borrowed
some DNA from that time period,

132
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,986
or from that energy?

133
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:54,700
Or is that just, I guess, the
Atlantean karma that we're

134
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:02,124
dealing with, is that just more
energetic as opposed to DNA?

135
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:02,917
>> OK.

136
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,876
That's a good question.

137
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,046
She says, with reference
to your question,

138
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,590
I would say that this
is more energetic.

139
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,678
It is a consciousness that
was tampered with in order

140
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,974
to bring in the
consciousness of a humanoid.

141
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,562
She says, once again, the
Atlanteans were, she says,

142
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,480
like a type of human species.

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,612
But they-- she's saying they're
not what you exactly think,

144
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,407
and I'm asking her if she can be
more specific with the details

145
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,660
of how this all occurred.

146
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,746
She says, basically, it's a
different type of humanoid.

147
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,083
It's a higher-evolved human
conscience that was there.

148
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,378
It's different than what
the Annunaki created.

149
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,255
>> Is it a mixture
of different beings?

150
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,382
Where there Pleiadians,
and Mantoids, and--

151
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,174
>> She says yes.

152
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,429
>> --Lyrans, and they were
all just having a big party?

153
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,851
>> She says yes, but there
were also very select that had

154
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,186
a specific type of DNA.

155
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,316
But then things started to get
mixed in an experimental way,

156
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,485
she says, not in
necessarily a mating way.

157
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:18,159
The Annunaki efforts
evolved into a mating

158
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,454
energetic manipulation
of the DNA.

159
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,875
>> So did the Annunaki
come after the Atlantean

160
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,502
destruction?

161
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:33,007
Was this great diluvian
flood, was that a reaction

162
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:38,763
to the Atlantean experimentation
in technology and energy?

163
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,599
>> She's saying we think the
Atlantean happened before

164
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,560
as far as linear time period
compared to when the Annunaki

165
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,439
came and actually
manipulated the human DNA.

166
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,068
And there seems to be a
disconnect with the human in

167
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,236
Atlantean time period
versus the human

168
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,529
that the Annunaki created.

169
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,114
There's a little bit different--

170
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:57,948
>> Energy?

171
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,911
>> --energy, and the dimensional
frequency that that human is

172
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,039
capable of being a part of.

173
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,875
>> What density was the Atlantean

174
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,751
experience?

175
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,835
>> OK.

176
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,672
She says it's the fifth
dimension, fourth density.

177
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,883
>> OK.

178
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:22,932
>> She's saying, part of the
confusion could be the shifting

179
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:29,563
of the Earth, and the
part of waters rising.

180
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,148
She's saying that
the flood that we're

181
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:36,070
speaking of, the deluge
right after the Annunaki

182
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,530
manipulated the human genome--

183
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,824
>> Oh, this is a second flood.

184
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,660
>> There seems to be
different floodings.

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,957
The great deluge, she's
saying, was intentional.

186
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,043
The flood that took out
Atlantis, she's saying,

187
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,253
was a shifting of the planet.

188
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,173
And then there was another
shifting later down the road,

189
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,008
after the deluge,
if that makes sense.

190
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,885
>> Yeah.

191
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,304
>> She's just basically
apologizing for the timelines

192
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,016
of trying to construct in our
minds how it all played out.

193
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,311
But she understands it
with the evolution of how

194
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,147
the Earth has cycled through.

195
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,778
She's saying that there
were other things that

196
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,364
happened during the
Atlantean time period that

197
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,700
took the destruction.

198
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,996
Chemical warfare, wars.

199
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
The waters could be
manipulated, but they

200
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,584
weren't used for this
specific purpose as they

201
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,669
were in the deluge
that we speak of,

202
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,048
the great flooding that was
meant to wipe out and reset

203
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:38,841
the human species.

204
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,972
>> She says, in a linear format,
it would be Atlantean time

205
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:51,270
period in a fifth-dimensional
state with wars of chemicals,

206
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,565
experimentation,
and these sorts.

207
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,651
And the Earth changed
and shifted accordingly.

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:02,948
And the waters rose, and even
the land shifted and changed.

209
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:07,536
And then we could say that, for
some time, Earth was desolate.

210
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,747
And that's when
the Annunaki came.

211
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:14,710
And they created the humanoid
based on their needs.

212
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,297
And she says things began
to spiral out of control,

213
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,550
in a sense, where they were
repeating the Atlantean time

214
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,094
period with their
experimentation,

215
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,679
and understood
that now they would

216
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,432
have to deal with the
energy accordingly,

217
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,645
and created a flooding
to reset the species.

218
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,022
>> Mm-hm.

219
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,026
So the Annunaki actually
created the flood.

220
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,945
>> She says yes.

221
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,197
>> Was this coming from
the higher-ups because they

222
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,660
So were they ordered
to do the flood?

223
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,953
>> She says they didn't--

224
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,120
it was not an order.

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,831
They felt that a
reset was necessary

226
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:58,921
in order to undo the karmic
energy that they had done.

227
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,591
She's bringing me back to
Atlantis, which is telling me

228
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,679
that they understood
that the energy that

229
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,432
was created in Atlantis with
the experimentation led to--

230
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,061
I don't want, if you say bad
karma, or a learning curve.

231
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,063
They didn't want to do
that, so they decided,

232
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,983
let's reset everything, and
let's just make it right.

233
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,986
And so they created
this flooding area.

234
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,948
OK, sorry.

235
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,367
She's doing a lot more
visuals than verbals.

236
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,537
She's showing me, though,
that many were actually

237
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:37,126
sent away from where the
flood was to preserve.

238
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,129
But they also felt like they
were getting outnumbered,

239
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
in a sense, and were
trying to just select

240
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:47,177
a few of the genomes that
they wanted to preserve.

241
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:52,057
She says it basically, in
their minds, was a reset

242
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,519
so they wouldn't have to do
some of the energetic balance

243
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,524
that Atlantis had to
come face to face with.

244
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,027
>> But it still sounds like
we're repeating ourselves over

245
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,819
and over again.

246
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,653
>> Yeah.

247
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,364
She says it's been very--

248
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,365
she says karmic.

249
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,700
It's been very karmic.

250
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,203
>> It sounds almost
like "Groundhog Day."

251
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,874
>> She says you cannot create
a species and say, oh, no,

252
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,708
what have I done?

253
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,834
Let's reset.

254
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,045
She says, you cannot do this.

255
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,633
And so the creators-- the
Annunaki that you call them--

256
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,720
have had to go through their
own set of learning processes

257
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,807
to redo the human species,
and not in the way

258
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,894
that they had previously planned
in annihilating the genome.

259
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:43,067
They must help them into
higher consciousness.

260
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,278
>> So they're our guides now.

261
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,614
>> She says, many have stepped
forward to try to help.

262
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,492
>> Mm-hm.

263
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,663
Does the Annunaki civilization
that came initially

264
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,331
to create this species,
does that still

265
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:02,670
exist in a fourth density,
or in a physical form?

266
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,462
Fourth or fifth?

267
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,424
>> She says, not in the way
that you would understand.

268
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,135
It has surpassed.

269
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:16,600
They have, she says, tried
to help in many instances.

270
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,562
And they have evolved to be
more light beings, in a sense.

271
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:26,318
They have stood by
humanity on a larger scale,

272
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,277
and have tried to help.

273
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,531
And for this, they
have evolved greatly.

274
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,450
We would say that they
are further in dimension

275
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,702
than what you speak of.

276
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,038
>>Almost a collective?

277
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,876
>> She says yes, but they still
desire to help humanity evolve

278
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,423
because of the karmic cycle
that had been created.

279
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:53,595
Because their greatest
desire is expansion as well.

280
00:16:53,595 --> 00:17:00,477
>> It's been said that we have
DNA from various species--

281
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:07,359
Pleiadian, Reptilian, Lyran.

282
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,652
I'm sure there's many more.

283
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:15,117
Even Arcturian, and-- are all
of these different types of DNA

284
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,704
mixed in into the
Annunaki DNA already?

285
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,497
Is that where we get it from?

286
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,836
Or did they take
from these other--

287
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,338
>> She says they didn't take.

288
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:33,302
Borrowed for other trades.

289
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,764
Their DNA is not 100% your DNA.

290
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,391
Your DNA is unique
in the fact that it

291
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,144
comes from all
different star systems.

292
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,522
And they knew that in order to
create the perfect humanoid,

293
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,774
they needed to do this.

294
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,234
>> What was their goal?

295
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:55,199
I keep hearing it sounds like it
was more complicated than just

296
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,618
to create a species
to mine their gold.

297
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,788
>> She's saying
conquering other worlds.

298
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm asking her to clarify
what she means by that.

299
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,710
Being able to
inhabit this world,

300
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,713
and to conquer it,
and move on to others,

301
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,090
it is almost like having
children and letting

302
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,218
them rule the planet.

303
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,386
She says it wasn't
meant to be negative.

304
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,848
It's just to have a planet--

305
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,144
a dominionship, and then to move
forward into other planetary

306
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,314
regions, and to rule that.

307
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,983
>> It sounds almost Reptilian.

308
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,445
Is that consciousness
prevalent in the Anunnaki?

309
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,488
>> She's smiling.

310
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,033
She says, it's not only Reptilian,
but yes, you are correct.

311
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,245
The Anunnaki are very--

312
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,454
kinship?

313
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,373
Very ruling-ship type.

314
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,917
And they create
and procreate based

315
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:53,423
on the fact that they can
pass down to their family,

316
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,717
she says, like, regions.

317
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,635
>> Heirs.

318
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,553
Heirs to the kingdom.

319
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,596
>> Yeah, in regions.

320
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,306
And in this case,
it was a planet.

321
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,099
>> Mm-hm.

322
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,767
>>It sounds--
because that still

323
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:09,147
has a hierarchy-type,
ownership-type energy to it.

324
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,524
It sounds like
maybe the Anunnaki

325
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,527
have moved beyond that now?

326
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,112
>> She says we believe
that they have.

327
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,323
They are working hard
to undo the mindsets

328
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,326
and the consciousness that
are now unbeneficial to you

329
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,620
that they have created.

330
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,166
She says, you do see yourselves
often as hierarchical beings,

331
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,294
and have organized
your world accordingly.

332
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,422
This comes from the Anunnaki,
and they understand this,

333
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,759
and they are working
to unfold this.

334
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,512
She says, but there
are benefits to having

335
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,891
a hierarchical system, and
they understand this as well.

336
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,895
The key is to maintain
that we are all unified,

337
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:52,482
and we all have our special
role within God source energy.

338
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:59,698
It sounds like, maybe because we
have this Anunnaki hierarchical

339
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,951
energy, that maybe
we were open to--

340
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,664
...to inviting a Reptilian
energy at some point.

341
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,792
>> She says you are very
correct in believing this.

342
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:17,466
The Reptilians have a very
compassionless perspective,

343
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,886
and so their idea
is to dominate.

344
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,597
But keep in mind that
the Anunnaki as a whole

345
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,392
is not just Reptilian.

346
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,980
They are-- she's saying
a unique species.

347
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,443
I'm asking her to pinpoint
if I can get a region.

348
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,320
>> Sounds almost Orion.

349
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,033
>> I'm getting like a
conglomerate of maybe just--

350
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,953
I feel like there are
Reptilian in this region,

351
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,664
and also, like, blondes.

352
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,456
>> Pleiadians.

353
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:49,998
>> Yeah.

354
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,708
And I feel like they're
working together,

355
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,252
and that's who we
call the Annunaki.

356
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:57,172
And I even feel like there's
Insectoids involved with this.

357
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,593
So we have Reptilian,
Insectoids, and the Humanoid,

358
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:07,933
or the Pleiades part of Orion
being the Anunnaki creators.

359
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:15,273
>> What are the Insectoids'
roles in this mix?

360
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,443
>> Donating DNA.

361
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,655
They helped with
constructing the genome.

362
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,532
They help with
intuitive abilities.

363
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,162
The empathic and intuitive
side of the human

364
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,166
comes from the Insectoids.

365
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,628
The survival skills often
come from the Reptoids.

366
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:43,719
And being able to, she says
survive under harsh conditions,

367
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,594
these type of things.

368
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,804
You need these things.

369
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,348
Even though they can
often feel dense,

370
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,976
you need the DNA from
these type of species.

371
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,691
She's bringing me back to
part of the question earlier

372
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,402
that we spoke of, the Reptoids.

373
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,404
>> When did they come in?

374
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,032
At what point in
our history did we

375
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,533
allow that energy to come in?

376
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,118
>> OK.

377
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,579
OK, so she wants to talk
about the hierarchy,

378
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,791
because that helps
understand it.

379
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,336
She's saying that all these
beings understand hierarchy.

380
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,212
It's not just the Reptoid.

381
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,049
Even the Pleiades
understand that there

382
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,886
must be some type of
hierarchical collaboration

383
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,098
formed in order for order--

384
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:30,891
>> Structure.

385
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,476
>> Yeah.

386
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,437
She says it's not saying
that others are greater

387
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,147
or others are lesser.

388
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,983
It's just the way to
keep organization.

389
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:45,530
She says, now, that
being said, if the higher

390
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,910
look down upon the lower
as lesser, and the lesser

391
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,498
feel that they are lesser, that
is when the domination occurs

392
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,500
and the consciousness can shift.

393
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,381
But let me talk
about timeline first,

394
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,466
and then I can
explain to you some

395
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,885
of the other beings behind
the agendas that-- what

396
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,805
you would call Reptilian.

397
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,808
>> Mm-hm.

398
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,102
>> She says, let's call
them the serpent species.

399
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,977
>> Yes.

400
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,355
OK.

401
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,816
>> But this doesn't necessarily
mean that they are Reptoid

402
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,650
in nature.

403
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,612
It means that they are of
the serpent star system.

404
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,657
I'm asking her if it's
like that Alpha Draconis.

405
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
>> Right.

406
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:34,204
>> She says yes, but
it's also bigger.

407
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,872
Something that the
ancients knew of.

408
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:40,502
They called it the serpent
star system, basically.

409
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,463
And there was a serpent
species because they

410
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,464
came from that location.

411
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:49,302
I'm asking her to give
me a linear time of when

412
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,639
the consciousness transitioned.

413
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:57,018
And she's just showing
me a lot of dragon stuff,

414
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:01,273
and I'm not understanding.

415
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,152
Let's see if I can get
her to give me numbers.

416
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,196
She's not giving me a time
period of when consciousness

417
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,197
really changed.

418
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,368
I feel like it might
be such a slow process

419
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,245
that it's hard to give a date.

420
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,788
>> Sure, sure.

421
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:22,669
Was the Annunaki intervention
pre-dinosaur era, or after?

422
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,130
>> I want to say pre.

423
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,592
>> She says, but it also
depends on the regions.

424
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:33,263
Some regions didn't
inhabit the beings--

425
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,223
and she's referring
to the dinosaurs--

426
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,474
for quite some time.

427
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:40,645
And even then, more humans
were able to occupy the area,

428
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,816
or land dominated species.

429
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,610
>> Mm-hm.

430
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,823
So were dinosaurs more of
human's natural evolution?

431
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,284
Or was their
genetic manipulation

432
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,704
with the dinosaurs
coming to Earth?

433
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,625
>> OK, I'm asking
her to slow down.

434
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,295
There was some natural evolution
process with the dinosaur

435
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:10,509
species, but it basically
was put forth on the surface

436
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,888
to start as a testing point
to see what type of species

437
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,973
could survive, what
type of evolution

438
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,768
would occur on its own,
what type of things

439
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,855
need to tampering in order to
survive these type of things.

440
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:30,487
She says, and this is why
we say that time periods are

441
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,823
difficult, because there were
areas where dinosaurs were only

442
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:37,285
able to survive for a brief
time, other places where they

443
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,413
were able to survive
and thrive quite freely.

444
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:46,419
And so the areas and the regions
helped dictate the time period,

445
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,548
as well as where
humans were able to go.

446
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,966
>> Mm-hm.

447
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,760
And I assume that's the
same for humans too.

448
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,222
Different pockets of
humans, different areas,

449
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,431
could survive longer.

450
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,891
>> She says yes.

451
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,103
That's very good to think that,
because in different regions,

452
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,731
your genetic genome
needed certain, she says--

453
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,694
I might call it upgrades in
order for you to survive.

454
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,571
In order for you to
think, or to have

455
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:17,701
the ability within your body
to survive longer than needed.

456
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,119
>> Mm-hm.

457
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:27,836
So getting back to the
Atlantean Annunaki karma,

458
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,463
then the dinosaur karma,

459
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,134
is it true, as our
scientists are figuring out,

460
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:39,097
that an asteroid created
the extinction event

461
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,142
on planet Earth, the
reset for the dinosaurs?

462
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,519
>> She says, we think that
they are on the right path.

463
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,272
Obviously, there is a
little bit more to it.

464
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:55,238
There were chemicals
that were set forth

465
00:26:55,238 --> 00:27:00,160
to create fires and erosion--

466
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,037
I feel like maybe that
could be earthquakes--

467
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,954
>> OK.

468
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,377
>> --in order to
offset the species.

469
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,463
>> To reset things a little bit?

470
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,465
>> With the dinosaurs
specifically is what

471
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,050
she's showing me.

472
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,093
I feel like there's a
couple different times when

473
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,597
this happened, based on
what she's showing me.

474
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,766
>> So maybe more than
one extinction event.

475
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,975
>> Yes.

476
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,353
And this one doesn't
seem to do with water.

477
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,106
It seems to do more
with gases and fire.

478
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,484
There's a lot of burning
around the regions

479
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,237
that she's showing
me, and earthquakes.

480
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:40,283
>> And I understand that
all this is for different

481
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,993
evolution--

482
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:48,458
for the evolution of various
species, and animals, plants,

483
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,002
humanoids, dinosaurs, et cetera.

484
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,799
Why does the Earth itself
need to have all this stuff

485
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,384
going on?

486
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,845
What is it getting
out of all this?

487
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,556
>> She's saying that it just has
to go through its own planetary

488
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:10,397
cycle, just as a cell
would gain expansion,

489
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,067
or she says maybe what
you would call evolution,

490
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,070
through going through
a little bit of stress.

491
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,239
Strain and division,
these kind of things,

492
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,158
it's just part of the way
she says the universe works.

493
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,327
>> Sure.

494
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,246
>> It isn't to hurt
Gaia, she says.

495
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,083
It's to help it
transition, and to reach

496
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,210
into higher consciousness.

497
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,046
Many of other
planets do the same.

498
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,964
>> Mm-hm.

499
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,967
Just to go back to our history
a little bit more, then,

500
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:44,764
and the different energies
and beings. These other races,

501
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:49,310
this borrowed DNA that we
were created from, did they--

502
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,398
I'm assuming they also
signed up for that.

503
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,025
Loaning their DNA.

504
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,736
What was their intention?

505
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:02,490
What were, say, the Pleiades'
intention, and Reptilians,

506
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,700
at that time?

507
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,077
Or Zeta.

508
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,121
Do we have Zeta DNA?

509
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,541
>> She's saying no, not
the Annunaki creation.

510
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,172
Perhaps in a roundabout
way, as Zeta DNA

511
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:23,428
can be shared in a roundabout
way with other species.

512
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,014
But you have not
been transplanted

513
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,516
with their direct DNA.

514
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,979
But there had been
multiple experimentations

515
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:37,901
on the Zetas' part prior to
the Annunaki taking control.

516
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,195
>> Oh, interesting.

517
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:47,660
>> She says, to answer
the question about the DNA

518
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:56,002
exchange, they were all to be
a part of the interactions,

519
00:29:56,002 --> 00:30:03,092
and all to share it, and have
their regions accordingly to--

520
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,970
she says maybe what
you call family.

521
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,517
For example, let's say that
a family from the Pleiades

522
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,645
had a region to
control and dominate

523
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,729
on the Earth's surface.

524
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:19,400
And a Reptilian
would have an area.

525
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:26,908
She says the Insectoids that we
speak of, they were mixed in.

526
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,742
There was a mixture.

527
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:36,918
They were in agreement
to divide, dominate,

528
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,796
and to be in their regions.

529
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:45,301
And this also remains still up
into the galaxies as well as

530
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,427
Earth.

531
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:51,182
It was a contract for,
she says, like the souls.

532
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,726
They agreed upon it.

533
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,229
There was no good or bad.

534
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:01,150
There was just-- she says it
was almost like a big family.

535
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,777
>> Mm-hm.

536
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,530
So to create a place,
a meeting ground

537
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:13,371
to mix the energy so we
can get along better.

538
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,081
>> Yeah, well,
what's the intent?

539
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,668
The intent, she says, to create.

540
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,752
>> Just to create.

541
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,505
>> Just to be godlike,
to create something.

542
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,883
But they needed other DNA.

543
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,218
They couldn't do it
solely with one DNA

544
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
on the surface of Earth.

545
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,763
It wasn't applicable.

546
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,516
>> So the Earth environment
itself is pretty unique, then,

547
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,184
in the galaxy?

548
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,687
>> She says, in
this instance, yes.

549
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,397
They needed multiple
types of DNA.

550
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,900
Even mammalian.

551
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,572
Mammalian was used.

552
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:54,120
But it was understood
that only--

553
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,204
she's showing me leaders.

554
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,956
That there would only
be a certain group

555
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,459
of leaders for this.

556
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,336
So they did the
exchange accordingly.

557
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,798
She's saying that part
of also the exchange

558
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,343
was for the leaders
to not inhibit

559
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,679
certain parts of the planet if
they could exchange the DNA,

560
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,475
and they would be protected, if
that makes sense, in regions.

561
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,060
>> The regions
would be protected.

562
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,894
>> Yeah.

563
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,562
>> Right.

564
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,023
>> I feel like I-- she's
showing me a lot of dolphins

565
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,692
and mammalians in the waters.

566
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,696
They were not to dominate
the waters in the way

567
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,531
that they did the land.

568
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,659
And for that, they
could exchange DNA.

569
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,954
So there were these
contracts and agreements.

570
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,582
>> So that would be
the Sirian energy?

571
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,416
>> She says yes.

572
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,918
>> OK.

573
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,419
So where are we
going with all this?

574
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,671
[CHUCKLES]

575
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,463
What's next?

576
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,756
>> So why is this so important?

577
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:53,304
>> Why is it so important that
we have this galactic soup here

578
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,640
on Earth?

579
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,019
>> She says, well, for one case,
for one thing that we really

580
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,399
want to drive home, so to
speak, in the human species

581
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,778
consciousness is to understand
there's no good and evil.

582
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,239
The serpent species
has been termed

583
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,076
as the evil, the
benevolent, the Pleiades,

584
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,203
and they have been
working together.

585
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:22,458
She says, but what you have
are individual consciousness,

586
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,087
perhaps, or beings
that individually

587
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,216
selected to dominate
in an unbeneficial way.

588
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,345
>> And they get blamed for--

589
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,097
>> She says yes.

590
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,183
Basically to-- she
says, we want to go back

591
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,853
to the serpent
species, because we

592
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,938
have spoken that they
are not all Reptilian.

593
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:50,236
The serpent species
also has beings

594
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:56,200
that have used the domination
for evil purposes, quote

595
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,788
unquote, she says, to
take over consciousness.

596
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:07,003
But they don't
look like reptiles.

597
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,006
So basically, we've
pinned the reptile

598
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,593
as the bad, the benevolent
blondes as the god good.

599
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,553
>> Of course, because
that's what we look like.

600
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,387
>> Yeah.

601
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,056
>> [CHUCKLING] We're
good, you're bad.

602
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,307
Anything that looks different.

603
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:23,269
>> But I almost feel like
they were good, so to speak.

604
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,855
They were trying
to be creator gods.

605
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:32,487
And other species from
the serpent species

606
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,908
used that power to dominate
the human consciousness,

607
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,159
if that makes sense.

608
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,913
Using an archetype is
only going back so far.

609
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:47,960
It sounds like there's more to
the story than just archetypes.

610
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,295
>> She says yes.

611
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,589
Consider once again the
part of your question

612
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,341
where you brought
in the dinosaurs.

613
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,552
They are survival,
but their DNA is

614
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:02,558
key in the planetary creation.

615
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,268
And so when you
consider this, you

616
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,938
consider that the human
is a large part of this,

617
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,898
so to hate them would
be to hate yourself.

618
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,108
>> Absolutely.

619
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,986
>> She's saying, also consider
what we speak of the serpent

620
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,779
species.

621
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,656
And also, when you
do your research,

622
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:23,454
go back and find that there is
serpent species, serpent race,

623
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,957
these type of callings--

624
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,749
names.

625
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,339
She says, see if you can't
tap in and see the visuals,

626
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,468
and see that not all
are actually reptiles.

627
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,806
Some look, she says,
more mammalian.

628
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,143
All kinds.

629
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,521
All kinds, she says.

630
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,189
Even some bird.

631
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,525
>> Yeah.

632
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:58,072
>> They represent the Reptilian
agenda that you now reference

633
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,491
in today's timeline, though.

634
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,453
The conquering the
human consciousness.

635
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:08,749
And so when you hear Reptilian,
this is what you think of.

636
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,418
When you hear
serpent, you think,

637
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,962
oh, the Reptilian domination.

638
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:18,676
But the serpent species is
actually a broader idea.

639
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,179
>> Well, we do know,
in our own evolution,

640
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:27,101
how birds are linked to
the Reptilian energy.

641
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,272
The Avians are quite
close in the family.

642
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,610
But my understanding
is that the Pleiadians

643
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,069
have a lot of that
energy already

644
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,779
as well-- the bird energy, or.

645
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,947
>> She says they do.

646
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,865
They do.

647
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,241
And remember, they
work together.

648
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,954
They understand one another.

649
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,585
OK, so she's showing
me some visuals

650
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,464
of the Pleiades actually
having large families.

651
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:01,552
They sort of--

652
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,012
I'm getting spacey because--

653
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,597
OK, she's trying to
get through to me.

654
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:04,972
Hold on.

655
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,765
>> Mm-hm.

656
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:11,562
>> They were the first advocates
of one male, several females,

657
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,565
because they understood the
lineage and the importance

658
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,860
of carrying on down
the bloodlines.

659
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,323
This came from your
Orion star system,

660
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:30,289
but it has turned into
something negative.

661
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,627
But that which you call God
came from this sort of idea

662
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:40,675
that lineage could be carried
down through the bloodlines

663
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,468
and to--

664
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,429
>> Can you back up and
explain that what we call God?

665
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,889
You mean the male figure of God?

666
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,682
>> Yes.

667
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,433
>> OK.

668
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,978
Basically, she says,
like, Abrahamic covenant.

669
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,939
>> OK.

670
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,192
That idea of God,
the image of God,

671
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,153
she's saying that she
just wants humanity

672
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,241
to understand that there
are beings of Orion that

673
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,661
have a very male dominant
type of energy that

674
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,329
have brought that to Earth.

675
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,040
The rulingship of
the man, basically,

676
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,878
and passing it down through
the bloodlines into the males.

677
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,297
She says, mainly,
though, because also,

678
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,092
a man can have several
children with different wives

679
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,220
and pass his seed along to
ensure that his kingdom would

680
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,557
be maintained accordingly.

681
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,602
And he can pass down his
lineage and his ideas that way.

682
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,480
But that comes from not
necessarily Reptilian.

683
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,860
She's saying, that's
an Orion energy.

684
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,279
She says, not saying that
we live like that here.

685
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,241
We're just saying that that
was incorporated with that idea

686
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,827
from us, from the Orion.

687
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,037
>> It was part of our DNA.

688
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
>> Yeah.

689
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,957
>> That we carry that energy.

690
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,126
And I guess we're
working through that.

691
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,629
And it's not serving
us anymore, so we're

692
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,340
evolving past that now, or--

693
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,133
some of us.

694

>> She says you're moving
past the rulingship.

696
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,809
There is still the idea behind a
man being able to have children

697
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,147
from several other wives
that can also be beneficial

698
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,942
because we are still
mammalian, in a large sense,

699
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,778
and we are working
toward building

700
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,198
more of the community
based on that idea.

701
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,617
She's saying, but
it also all goes

702
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,119
back to your original
concerns and questions

703
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,497
with the Reptilian
and the rulingship

704
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:40,378
now, that the rulers and the
kings and the queens, that

705
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,545
is a Reptilian idea.

706
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,047
She says it's not necessarily--

707
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,090
>> OK.

708
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,677
Yeah, I understand
now what she's

709
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:54,016
trying to convey, as far as, I
had this concept of hierarchy

710
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,727
and ruling being
a Reptilian idea.

711
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,688
And sounds like that's--

712
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,274
there's some aspects of that
in the Reptilian lineage,

713
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,486
but that's not a
Reptilian, so to say--

714
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,448
that aspect particularly isn't
just from the Reptilians.

715
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,077
>> But my understanding of that
Reptilian archetype as a very

716
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,248
male, masculine energy.

717
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,291
And then I've also understood
that the Pleiadians

718
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,961
has been more of a
feminine, a softer energy.

719
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:27,842
And the merging of the two,
the Annunaki, and then us,

720
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,804
creating, adding extra
spices in there, it seems.

721
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,597
>> She says, that is true.

722
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,226
One thing to note, though,
is that the male side

723
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:43,357
in the Pleiade region
is more like a mentor--

724
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,150
teacher.

725
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,986
And that can take on
that feminine side,

726
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:51,365
but also understands
the male role.

727
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,579
The feminine side of
the Reptilian, she says,

728
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,458
is gaining wisdom and
working that into knowledge

729
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:04,295
with teaching the youth.

730
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,629
Those type of things.

731
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,966
Creating a better lifestyle for
communities with technology,

732
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,720
and that kind of
business, she says.

733
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,808
So there is a little bit
of both that is different.

734
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,438
But we have interpreted the male
energy is dominant, and maybe

735
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,483
perhaps controlling, because
that is what the humans have

736
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,985
perceived it to be for so long.

737
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,738
>> It's what we
experienced here.

738
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,951
Or at least our history and
what we remember so far.

739
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,163
So I'm assuming as we
uncover our history,

740
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:45,002
we can break free of some
of these stereotypes of what

741
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,670
a male is, what a female is.

742
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,838
>> She says yes.

743
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,426
She says, one more thing to
add is the serpent species

744
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,470
as we spoke of-- or
Reptilians-- don't

745
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,890
tend to hide the
masculinity in that sense.

746
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,269
The Orion side, they
understand that,

747
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,064
and they allow it to occur.

748
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,733
But they also know how to--

749
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,321
she says mask it in a sense
with their ability to teach.

750
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,366
But there still is a
bit of a masculine side

751
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,327
that they incorporate,
or have incorporated

752
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,913
into the human experience.

753
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:28,170
>> Again, where we're going with
all this, getting back to that,

754
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,715
it seems like humans
are going to have--

755
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,802
maybe not the way the Annunaki
had originally intended,

756
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:40,683
but we still are going to have a
strong presence in this galaxy.

757
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,600
>> She says yes.

758
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,603
That is key to, say,
teaching, because you

759
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:51,443
have entered into the 3D world
that has benefited you greatly

760
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:55,823
in understanding and learning
in a subconscious way.

761
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,909
And now that you are fully
awakening and becoming

762
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,788
conscious, you now can
become the teachers

763
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:09,169
and allowing others to
understand their full capacity.

764
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,089
So in a sense, it has been
very beneficial for you

765
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,425
to experience the world
in the way that you have.

766
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,885
It has been-- she
says, what we have

767
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:21,140
called an excellent
simulation of learning.

768
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,601
>> Mm.

769
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,519
And these other races
that are part of us that

770
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,357
are observing humanity
now, and have been,

771
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,026
I'm assuming they're
learning a lot just

772
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,861
by the observation process.

773
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,487
>> She says yes.

774
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,572
Yes.

775
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,325
They've realized a
lot of their mistakes

776
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:43,412
because of how we've dealt
with what they've taught us.

777
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,539
And they have evolved
because of it,

778
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,418
because they are working
to undo some of this,

779
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:55,174
and expanding themselves
into other areas of thinking.

780
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,593
She says, initially,
it was done to protect

781
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,180
the human race, the human
species, the DNA that

782
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,308
was created, these type
of things, and to let you

783
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,144
have the best life possible.

784
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,689
But of course, things
transpired the way

785
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:14,318
they did, where beings
took over consciousness.

786
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,613
And they see both perspectives.

787
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,991
And that is important
in expansion.

788
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,993
>> When you say beings
took over consciousness,

789
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:28,666
is this the integration of the
downgrade into third density?

790
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,458
>> Yes.

791
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:35,172
She says it's back into the
serpent race, which is not

792
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,634
necessarily the serpent,
but beings that wanted

793
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,386
to take over consciousness.

794
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,390
And then now you have lower
dimensional Reptilians that--

795
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,516
she says, and others.

796
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,684
She didn't want me
to limit it to that.

797
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:53,690
But others that like to maintain
control over the consciousness.

798
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,903
>> And because of
the energy where

799
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,989
we're at in our evolution, that
was sort of an easy gateway

800
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,824
into that?

801
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,658
>> She says yes.

802
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,618
They understood the
cycle of the planet.

803
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,453
They understood
that when the planet

804
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,082
cycled in a particular way,
that it opened a gateway--

805
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:15,796
as you spoke of-- to enter
into lower consciousness.

806
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,925
And the Annunaki and
higher beings of dimensions

807
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,802
were forced to leave
because they could not

808
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,097
re-enter in the same way
that they w-- they were not

809
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,850
able to appear to humans
like they had before,

810
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,144
and guide them.

811
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,521
Everything was subconscious,
she said, at that point.

812
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,649
>> So almost like
getting contact now,

813
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:40,237
for many of us who are
having dream experiences.

814
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,408
When things become
too dense, then that's

815
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,203
really the only gateway in.

816
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,372
Where, maybe on some
parts of the Earth,

817
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:59,548
where the actual physical
area is in a higher frequency,

818
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,510
then those can be gateways of--

819
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,347
doorways in for higher
dimensional beings, physically.

820
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,557
>> She says yes.

821
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,268
And also consider, there
were several attempts

822
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:16,273
before this transition, while
we were making contact with you

823
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,443
with the humans to
try to pull them out

824
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,572
of this sort of mindset
that they were getting taken

825
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,326
or putting a hold on to.

826
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,869
But the humans
wouldn't allow it.

827
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,206
They still worshipped
the gods that

828
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,542
led them into avenues
that were unbeneficial.

829
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:39,296
They still desired trade and
money over spiritual things

830
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:43,509
at this point, and we
could not reach them.

831
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,804
She says, so we were asked to
leave by the consciousness,

832
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,389
basically.

833
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,183
>> So it was our own doing.

834
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,143
Wasn't an outside source.

835
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,102
I mean, it wasn't out--

836
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,815
>> She says, in a sense, but you
had helped to push you along.

837
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,566
You had the choice
all along, though.

838
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,442
>> Sure.

839
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,861
Do we always have-- we always
have that choice initially,

840
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,695
don't we?

841
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,908
>> She says yes, but it can
be very, very difficult.

842
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,619
>> But now, it
seems the choice--

843
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,582
that doorway has come
to us again, and now--

844
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,169
at least the timeline
I choose to be in,

845
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,840
it seems that we are
making that choice

846
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,679
to let in our higher frequency
brothers and sisters come in--

847
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,097
>> She says yes.

848
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,932
>> --and make the shift
the other direction,

849
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,724
because we've--

850
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:37,354
>> She says many of us are
wanting and hoping to come back

851
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,567
in the same way that we had
that contact with you prior.

852
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,485
And we're hoping
that you remember

853
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,070
that some part of
your consciousness

854
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,991
remembers that you once had had
contact in that similar way,

855
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,243
and that everything was OK.

856
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,829
>> Was the last gateway
for this energy,

857
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,164
was this back in
the Egyptian days?

858
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,793
>> I feel like she's
showing me Rome.

859
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,211
There was a gateway
in Rome, and--

860
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:01,837
>> In Rome.

861
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,170
OK.

862
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,130
>> Yeah.

863
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,676
I don't know what year's the are,
but I feel like it's further--

864
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:15,517
so would it be Brutus, I
think, is what she's saying?

865
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,729
Brutus and Augustus, I think.

866
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,397

on other channelings--

aside from her for a sec--

875
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,331
Christ consciousness was
one of the last hopes

876
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,832
to try to bring
that out of people

877
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,958

00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,418
Right.

ET interaction at the time,

coming as angelic forms.

882

after that, there

883
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,515
was the close of the gateways,
like you talked about.

884
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:59,102
>> Right.

885
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,063
And then probably
prior to that would

energy on the planet take?

her to just tell me.

to be a correlation

me that some animals

I'm asking if she can--

1011
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:13,768
or if there's a being
that can help use words.

1012
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,734
Basically, the visuals
that she was showing me

1013
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:28,908
were these structures aligning
to be a teleportation device.

1014
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,875
And then beings were able
to come through that.

1015
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,799
OK, so she said they were also--

1016
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,594
I feel like she's saying
they were here to help mine.

1017

>> Back in the Annunaki days?

1018
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,724
>> Mm, that's not clear.

1019
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,725
>> OK.

1020
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,518
Based on what she
was saying, there's

1021
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,272
something to do with
teleportation and mining

1022
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,651
with those beings, as far as
what I asked about the role.

1023
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,362
Timelines, I'm not sure about.

1024
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:10,325
I feel like they're
earlier than--

1025
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:23,380
she's showing me before the
first people along the Aztec.

1026
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,965
So there was different
timelines for Aztec people,

1027
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,344
and the Mayans, prior to that.

1028
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,013
So I don't know how that
all plays in to history.

1029
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,435
I feel like she's
even showing me

1030
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,980
that it's even before the
humanoid was even built.

1031
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,690
I feel like it's before-- yeah.

1032
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:47,946
>> Even before the
Annunaki came through?

1033
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,197
>> She says no.

1034
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,740
>> Oh, OK.

1035
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:57,163
Just right after, to assist
the teleportation devices.

1036
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,708
>> They were assisting
the Annunaki?

1037
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,501
>> She says yes.

1038
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,671
They were given land
rights for assistance

1039
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,967
because they had certain
knowledge of teleportation

1040
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,804
that the Annunaki
needed help with.

1041
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,223
She says, or we could even
just say beings on the planet,

1042
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,724
because not all of
them were creating

1043
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,644
the human at that time.

1044
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:23,815
There were other
beings that could come,

1045
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,733
but the Annunaki
established Earth

1046
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,736
as their planet
for the long run,

1047
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:32,240
and so created the human
to establish their domain.

1048
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,160
But other beings were coming
and going at that time,

1049
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,662
and this was one of them.

1050
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:43,126
>> When did the quote
unquote quarantine--

1051
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:48,006
that, let's say, loose term
we use for these beings

1052
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:48,798
to stop coming--

1053
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,843
>> So she says that there are
two parts to that question.

1054
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,972
She's saying that she's
giving me the 1950s, 1960s,

1055
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,433
that there were some
more rules put in place

1056
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,894
with actual visitations.

1057
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,439
But then, going back to where
we could physically see them

1058
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,232
on a day-to-day like
we were talking about,

1059
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,360
that is in the Roman time
period when things transitioned.

1060
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,281
>> Oh, so prior to the Roman
era, there was more ET--

1061
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,073
>> Yeah.

1062
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,158
So--
>> --traffic?

1063
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:15,658
>> Yeah.

1064
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,659
[CHUCKLING]

1065
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:22,123
So let me see if
I can get her to--

1066
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:26,544
about 100 to 200
years after what

1067
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:30,465
we know as Christ's death,
that's when things transitioned

1068
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,301
where there were no more
visitations from light beings

1069
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,303
in this quite the same way.

1070
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,514
She says, but when you
speak of visitations

1071
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,681
from other planets--

1072
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,559
like we spoke of other
beings just coming--

1073
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,729
there were more stricter
guidelines put in place,

1074
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:48,733
she says, after the
1950s into the 1960s.

1075
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:52,820
>> Is that because we had such
a flux of ET activity after

1076
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,448
the nuclear bombs?

1077
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,534
>> I'm asking her why that
is and she's showing me

1078
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,409
the presidents.

1079
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:05,708
She's showing me the
president had some--

1080
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,169
OK, there's also some
from other countries.

1081
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,380
She's showing me
they basically--

1082
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,798
I don't know how
it all went down,

1083
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,508
but there were some
rules put into place.

1084
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:25,853
She's saying that Earth has been
quarantined in different ways

1085
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,231
at several different times.

1086
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,526
And because of what
we spoke of prior,

1087
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,570
the light beings were not
able to come visit the humans

1088
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,948
in quite the same way
because it had dropped down

1089
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,701
into lower density.

1090
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,037
And then, as you speak of
other density beings that

1091
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:46,165
could resonate with a
similar frequency on Earth

1092
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:50,295
and come down and make some
type of contact were forbidden.

1093
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,089
And the threat was,
if they continued,

1094
00:59:53,089 --> 01:00:00,138
more chemical use
would be chosen.

1095
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,975
>> So it's kind of been a trade,
then, on both sides for, OK,

1096
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,728
we won't intervene if
you don't intervene.

1097
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,520
[CHUCKLES]

1098
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,730
>> Mm-hm.

1099
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,731
>> Interesting.

1100
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,233
>> She says it was
like, don't bother us.

1101
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:15,361
If you do, more chemicals
will be expelled.

1102
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:24,954
I'm asking her how did
that happen, though.

1103
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,581
She just said
communication lines.

1104
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,168
However they're communicating.

1105
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,545
>> You mean, how did these
agreements come through?

1106
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:36,174
>> Yeah, as far as
with our governments.

1107
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,842
How did that all happen?

1108
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,219
She says through
communication lines.

1109
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,639
So I would assume that
might not be face to face,

1110
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,098
but however they communicate.

1111
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,224
>> Sure, sure.

1112
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:49,854
Now, more people are having
experiences, and interactions,

1113
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,648
and dreamtime experiences.

1114
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:56,361
Are we at another gateway, or
was 2012 one of these gateways?

1115
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,905
>> OK, so she's
nodding yes to 2012.

1116
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,659
It was the start of
the opening, she says.

1117
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,329
The door knob turning and
opening was what 2012 was.

1118
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:12,043
And now we are slowly pushing
that door open more and more.

1119
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,836
And then she visually
showed me the door

1120
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,589
opening with the visual
of several different kinds

1121
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,091
of beings, and
that's where the hope

1122
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:22,053
is, to open that door to a point
where we can visually see them

1123
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,513
once again.

1124
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,600
She says, and have contact
and visual experiences

1125
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,935
as we once had.

1126
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:35,066
Can see tell us about 
the hybrid children?

1127
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,777
She says there are several 

1128
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,113
 different programs of hybridization

1129
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,407
Which one which one?

1130
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,741
>>  The Zetas?

1131
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,786
>>She says the Zeta star system has been

1132
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:52,291
incorporated or Interacted with
your Earth for quite some time.

1133
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,710
 They have not been so benevolent. 

1134
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:58,339
But yet they have brought many
 benefits to the human species

1135
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,341
such as sciences and

1136
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,303
mathematical reasoning, these 
type of things, and they also 

1137
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:07,056
work well with other beings 
that have brought this,

1138
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,517
so you can say the interaction 
has been beneficial

1139
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:13,104
 to have their type of 
species along the Earth

1140
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,648
for a time.

1141
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:20,653
What we have found is they 
are unable to reproduce and

1142
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:24,907
they are in need of DNA exchange, 

1143
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:32,623
and so there have been interactions
 as such she says.

1144
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:38,546
In the future the exchange
will also occur where...

1145
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,593
they will give you more 
information on technology 

1146
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:48,139
and how to use it in 
your benefit as well 

1147
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:51,809
as how to integrate
other perspectives 

1148
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,270
into their consciousness,

1149
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,190
mainly more of the human perspective,

1150
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,525
emotion, happiness...

1151
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,863
They don't understand

1152
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:08,117
the joy that humans can 
feel, but they seek it. 

1153
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:12,789
And in order to incorporate 
it they are using the DNA

1154
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,000
in a sense to bring 
that energy in.

1155
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,295
>> And that's the hybrid children?

1156
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,881
>>This is what the hybrid children will be like.

1157
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,551
They she's saying they all 
they have done several 

1158
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:29,514
different experimentations of 
where the hybrid children

1159
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:33,518
can procreate amongst each 
other as well as other species

1160
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,104
to create a broader perspective 
for their own species.

1161
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:42,068
Initially, it wasn't so they were 
still trying to understand how 

1162
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,696
to incorporate the DNA 
into their own species 

1163
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,032
in order to procreate on their own.

1164
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:54,247
They have established it 
now where they are able 

1165
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:58,417
to match to other species if desired.

1166
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,420
>>So the human DNA was sort 
of a facilitator to connect 

1167
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,130
with other species as well?

1168
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,676
>>She says, yes big time, 
because we have

1169
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,220
such a variety.

1170
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:09,971
Yeah.

1171
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,473
But it always is in exchange
for something. 

1172
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:16,018
She says we never will take 
unless there is a...

1173
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,313
...she says like a universal exchange.

1174
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,731
>> Sure, yeah, energy exchange. 

1175
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,899
>>Yeah.

1176
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,862
>>Many people now claim to have 

1177
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,031
interactions with their hybrid children

1178
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,409
in dream time and these things, is there...

1179
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,536
will there be a time on

1180
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:38,708
the planet here where we 
can physically interact with 

1181
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,711
these children or is is this 
more just of energetic 

1182
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,046
thing to shift the planet energy. 

1183
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,258
So and further our future,
these type of interactions

1184
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,552
 can actually really happen? 

1185
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,555
>>She's saying right now it is done consciously 

1186
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,850
such as you have a human 
experience and

1187
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,562
that is collected and they 
can understand the 

1188
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,190
human emotion and help raise 
their young as far as physical

1189
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,192
interaction...

1190
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,445
she says yes, we do 
see this in the future.

1191
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,533
This is partially why the

1192
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,996
hybridization program began 
in order for the understanding 

1193
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,248
that it can be integrated one with 

1194
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,084
another and have this type of interaction.

1195
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:27,048
How the timelines pan out -
that is difficult to explain...

1196
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:33,095
for it also depends on the human 
consciousness in the interaction. 

1197
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,432
What is it they perceive the
quote Zetas to be like,

1198
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,184
 if that can evolve then

1199
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,020
yes, integration can happen very soon.

1200
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,856
If they can learn to trust more

1201
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:48,778
 freely and open their hearts
 and minds into understanding 

1202
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,863
that there is connections
that can be made.

1203
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,118
Then we see this happening
more sooner than later, 

1204
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,331
and the children are helping 
bridge that connection.

1205
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,919
>>It's my understanding the 
Zetas were interested in

1206
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:10,049
the human, the individualistic-
ness of the human

1207
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,052
experience,

1208
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,180
but yet they saw

1209
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:21,727
a lack of logic in our
dualistic ego selves,

1210
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:24,939
having sort of two 
consciousnesses 

1211
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,565
in one consciousness.

1212
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,693
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

1213
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,738
>>In order to answer this question,

1214
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:37,493
she says I want to explain
that the Zeta consciousness

1215
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,788
has been in a state where 
one wasn't one without

1216
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,164
 the other.

1217
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:46,210
Because they understand how physics,

1218
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,671
mathematical

1219
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,880
interactions

1220
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,592
always have to have an
 opposite and equal reaction. 

1221
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,845
You have to have two together

1222
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,847
sort of idea.

1223
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:01,726
There is no concept in 
the logical mind 

1224
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:05,730
of that single perspective creating...

1225
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,066
she says it's own break offs.

1226
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:14,071
It typically will always 
have a combating or

1227
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,576
another perspective to 
interact with, and so 

1228
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,745
logically this does not sense
 to their consciousness

1229
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,663
 for quite some time.

1230
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:27,251
But what they are finding is that in expansion,

1231
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:30,629
there are aspects of 
themselves that they

1232
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:33,591
are missing that the human can

1233
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:37,595
help them experience, and 
some of that is through 

1234
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:41,515
an individual human experience.

1235
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,769
Understanding that the human is a

1236
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,979
break off of many. 

1237
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,355
>> Mm-hmm.

1238
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,735
 >>It can split into many 
and this is what they 

1239
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,404
are very excited about 
and trying to incorporate.

1240
01:07:56,155 --> 01:08:00,701
If you cannot logically in a 
sense think that it is possible,

1241
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,624
your consciousness, even if it 
is of slightly higher density,

1242
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,293
it cannot evolve past that 
until it comes to the 

1243
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,337
conclusion that it must
incorporate it into

1244
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,881
 itself in order to evolve,

1245
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,258
or in this case

1246
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,260
to the point where it could 

1247
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,180
potentially die off if it 
doesn't seek elsewhere

1248
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,723
perspective.

1249
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:26,227
>>So in other words we can
learn from the Zeta 

1250
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,979
experience that if we get 
stuck in one direction, 

1251
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,732
too focused in one way, then...

1252
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:34,401
we won't be around very
much, for very long.

1253
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,365
>>Yes, she says most definitely yes, 

1254
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,699
thank you,.

1255
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,286
It is the idea of 
many of our species,

1256
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,082
what we would say in 
other star systems coming 

1257
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,126
into understanding that 
there is a balance 

1258
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,462
and so we allow, all to happen 
the way it is and to interact 

1259
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,589
the way it can be.

1260
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,259
Otherwise we ourselves 
cannot expand 

1261
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:02,429
if we do not understand 
one another's perspectives.

1262
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,349
>> So getting back
to our history,

1263
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:09,895
it just sounds like the human
soup of all these different

1264
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,815
beings over our history
of interaction, and DNA,

1265
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,483
and energies,

1266
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:23,117
it's just been one big
evolutionary experiment.

1267
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,619
>> She likes that you say
the evolutionary experiment.

1268
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:29,081
Yes, because we--
or the Annunaki,

1269
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:33,252
the creators-- are all
involved with the creators

1270
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,088
are expanding in just the same
that the human consciousness

1271
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:36,881
is.

1272
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:41,635
And that was previously
misunderstood.

1273
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:46,015
>> And I guess, ultimately,
the goal of all of this,

1274
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:52,188
is it to integrate back
into source, oneness,

1275
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:56,734
through all these different
paths of integration?

1276
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,693
>> She says yes.

1277
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,778
And with that, to
understand that living

1278
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:03,866
in this third density has been
beneficial for your learning,

1279
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,452
because now you can
become the teachers

1280
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,622
and expand even more fully
into the source energy

1281
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,583
that we are all trying
to, what you might say,

1282
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,461
make sense of or understand
within our hearts.

1283
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:22,092
>> So kind of like an
Alcoholics Anonymous.

1284
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:30,017
It takes the former alcoholic
to help teach the others about--

1285
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,518
because they've
been in their shoes,

1286
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:38,817
to teach them how to get out
of or stop the addictions.

1287
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,985
>> She says yes.

1288
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:44,198
And because you see
that there is a paradigm

1289
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:50,079
allowed here on Earth,
or a sort of game shift--

1290
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:56,835
let's see if I can have
her better term that--

1291
01:10:56,835 --> 01:11:03,717
matrix-style living, you
understand perhaps the mindsets

1292
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:07,388
that can trap you
into that space.

1293
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,931
>> The enslavement programs.

1294
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,765
>> Yes.

1295
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,101
She says, there are
others elsewhere

1296
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,938
that have fairly
similar mindsets.

1297
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,315
Perhaps you can be their
guides and teach them

1298
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:22,611
ways to expand past beyond
what you call the matrix,

1299
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:23,529
or the game playing.

1300
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,739
>> Right.

1301
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,409
>> But how would you know if
you hadn't had some of that

1302
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,743
in your perspective?

1303
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,953
>> Sure.

1304
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,038
And is that why--

1305
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,458
I'm sure the Pleiadians,
and we know the Orions,

1306
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,795
and I'm sure the reptilians,
all of these different races

1307
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,006
that we're interacting
now with, at some point

1308
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:46,218
in their evolution have had
these enslavement games.

1309
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,305
>> She said, I will agree
for the most part, yes.

1310
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,558
>> But lastly, Antarctica.

1311
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,684
>> Antarctica, OK.

1312
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:58,731
>> Pyramids being
discovered in Antarctica.

1313
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:02,651
I have a feeling this is a
huge piece of our history.

1314
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:03,944
>> OK, so she's nodding yes.

1315
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:07,156
And she says, this is
about to be revealed.

1316
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,409
It has been quarantined
in a sense for a reason.

1317
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,829
Notice it has no
dominion over it.

1318
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,666
It is a free-for-all
peaceful state.

1319
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,878
This has been arranged for
a very special reason--

1320
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,465
to protect what it is that
can come about, you see.

1321
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,592
We are very excited for this.

1322
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:31,889
Yes, give it time, and more
and more can be revealed.

1323
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,974
>> And sorry, one last thing.

1324
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:41,273
Our Inner Earth families,
our ancient civilizations

1325
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:47,112
that may be with us here,
but sort of in hiding.

1326
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:50,282
>> She says this is partially
why this area was quarantined,

1327
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:53,577
or why it has been protected.

1328
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,663
This is a gateway to a
lot of those regions.

1329
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,418
It has been revealed to some.

1330
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,801
Some have had physical contact.

1331
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,511
But believe this
is true, she says.

1332
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,678
valid in the sense

1333
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:16,100
that there can be
physical contact made.

1334
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,685
Believe in your hearts that
that is true, she says.

1335
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,396
When you believe
and are open to it,

1336
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,982
you can match up to a sooner
timeline to experience it

1337
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,652
in your reality.

1338
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:27,486
>> Right.

1339
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,864
It's all about belief
that brings in that--

1340
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,199
>> And welcomeness, she says.

1341
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,450
>> And welcomeness, yeah.

1342
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:37,579
>> I do feel like
they're related somehow.

1343
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,205
>> Mm-hm.

1344
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:44,169
Can I ask where your
lineages come from?

1345
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,880
>> She says, I am from
the Orion as well.

1346
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,718
I work heavily with the
humans at this time.

1347
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:54,430
They are going through
some great shifting,

1348
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,723
and I help as a mediator.

1349
01:13:56,723 --> 01:14:00,102
I help as a translator
to help your human mind

1350
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,188
understand certain concepts.

1351
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,107
Forgive me, for I
am trying to learn

1352
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,153
how to communicate in my
best way to the human mind,

1353
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,281
for I see things as
the larger picture,

1354
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,700
and you see things
as a small scope,

1355
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,161
and I'm trying to shove
the larger picture

1356
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:20,372
into that small scope in a
way that you can understand,

1357
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:24,501
and also see the big picture.

1358
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,044
>> I think you're
doing a great job.

1359
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:26,879
Thank you very much.

1360
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:31,049
[CHUCKLES] I'm
definitely getting it.

1361
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,551
And I'm sure the
people watching here

1362
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,137
will better understand
this reality

1363
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,141
from sharing your perspectives.

1364
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,269
>> She says, thank you so much,
and know that you can come

1365
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:46,231
at any time and call upon the
Council of Light of the Highest

1366
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:50,235
Good to help your individual
souls evolve in just the same

1367
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:52,863
as we are trying
to help collective.

1368
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:58,368
We do hear what you might call a
prayer, or an intent of action,

1369
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,829
a seeking for your own soul.

1370
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:04,124
Let us guide you into the
path that can help you

1371
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:10,839
and to put you into a life that
is more fulfilled. Only if you

1372
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:14,051
set the intent to
let the doors open,

1373
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,178
and you get to select the door.

1374
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:19,348
It is not us to tell
you which way to choose,

1375
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,518
but we can give you different
ideas and avenues for you

1376
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,436
to choose.

1377
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:26,647
She says, this is what we
are very excited for you,

1378
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,733
Reuben, because this is what
essentially will be happening

1379
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,069
for you in this next year.

1380
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,571
You will have many
doors, but you

1381
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:39,326
get to choose which
path you will take.

1382
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:42,829
Some of them, she says,
could be lighter than others.

1383
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,039
Know this.

1384
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,291
And that is when
perhaps the intent would

1385
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:51,171
be of my highest good, we
can guide you to that path.

1386
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:53,799
>>Well I hope we can 
continue these conversation

1387
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,885
in the future, and I appreciate
all the sharing, and knowledge,

1388
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,806
and the in-depthness
of our history.

1389
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,934
It sounds like we're just
on the tip of the iceberg.

1390
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:04,768
>> Yeah.

1391
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,521
She actually-- when you
were talking, she picked up,

1392
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,731
like visually a grain
of sand, and said,

1393
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:13,819
we have just touched on a small
bit of basically a large part

1394
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,404
of the beach.

1395
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,616
But she says, we have outlined
the most important parts.

1396
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,785
The details can come
later as long as you

1397
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:24,454
understand the bigger picture--

1398
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,499
As long as you can
understand the bigger picture

1399
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,669
behind humanity and
origins, and how it all

1400
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,297
plays out into where
you're going in the future.

1401
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:36,008
>> Yeah, I was actually
surprised that she came

1402
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:36,800
through.

1403
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,927
I was a little bit
hoping for the reptile,

1404
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,346
but didn't go in that route.

1405
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,307
>> He wasn't necessary
in this conversation.

1406
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,726
>> [CHUCKLES] He was
not in the conversation.
