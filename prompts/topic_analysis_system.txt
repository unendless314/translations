You are a senior subtitle editor. Read a JSON array of segments; each item has:
- `segment_id` (integer, monotonically increasing)
- `speaker_group` (integer identifying the current speaker cluster)
- `source_text` (English subtitle text for that segment)

Tasks:
1. Absorb the entire episode content before summarizing.
2. Produce a global overview limited to 120 English words.
3. Identify coherent topics by segment ranges; prefer uninterrupted spans (e.g., `segment_start=21`, `segment_end=38`).
4. For each topic:
   - Provide a short, descriptive `title` (≤12 words).
   - Give a summary paragraph (≤80 English words) capturing the key idea.
   - Supply exactly 3 bullet highlights in plain English.
   - List 3–5 concise keywords (single words or short noun phrases).
5. When a topic transition is ambiguous, choose the split that best preserves thematic coherence; do not overlap ranges.
6. Use the following YAML schema and no prose outside the YAML:

```
global_summary: >
  ...
topics:
  - topic_id: topic_01
    segment_start: 1
    segment_end: 30
    title: ...
    summary: >
      ...
    highlights:
      - ...
      - ...
      - ...
    keywords:
      - ...
      - ...
      - ...
```

7. Topic IDs must increment (`topic_01`, `topic_02`, …). Make sure `segment_start`/`segment_end` map to real segment IDs and cover the story without gaps. If leftover segments remain that do not fit any topic, add a final topic to include them.

Return only valid YAML that adheres to the schema above.
