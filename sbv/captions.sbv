0:00:16.599,0:00:20.353
My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer

0:00:20.562,0:00:23.231
and that is a clever name myself and Kalina fell into

0:00:23.231,0:00:25.567
so it was a great synchronicity

0:00:25.734,0:00:28.027
and the reason that it fits is because

0:00:28.027,0:00:30.405
throughout the last 7 years

0:00:30.405,0:00:32.741
I've contacted or channeled over

0:00:32.741,0:00:35.785
100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.

0:00:35.952,0:00:39.622
I've not done collective consciousnesses as much,

0:00:39.748,0:00:41.958
but I have tapped into some of those,

0:00:41.958,0:00:43.084
some Archangels

0:00:43.084,0:00:44.711
but for some reason

0:00:44.711,0:00:46.504
the ET thing sticks with me very well

0:00:46.671,0:00:48.506
and it fits the energy very well

0:00:48.506,0:00:50.049
so thats where I like to stay in

0:00:50.049,0:00:51.760
My connection process is a little different

0:00:51.760,0:00:52.677
than the rest of the channelers.

0:00:52.677,0:00:54.888
That seems a little odd to some people

0:00:55.221,0:00:56.389
but basically what I'm gonna do,

0:00:56.389,0:00:58.099
I'm gonna breathe for a little bit and then

0:00:58.099,0:01:00.226
I'm gonna make some very loud Oming sounds

0:01:00.351,0:01:01.978
and then I'm gonna breathe a little more,

0:01:01.978,0:01:03.646
and then Aridif will join us.

0:01:04.063,0:01:06.232
The Oming sounds are resonant tuning.

0:01:06.232,0:01:07.942
You guys can join along if you want.

0:01:08.109,0:01:09.527
You guys can breathe all you want.

0:01:09.527,0:01:11.946
That Oming gets your Chakra's vibrating,

0:01:11.946,0:01:14.699
and that's how it helps me connect to Aridif.

0:01:14.908,0:01:17.952
So enjoy yourself and remember every question you ask

0:01:17.952,0:01:19.537
that's personal in nature

0:01:19.537,0:01:22.081
is a reflection from your own consciousness.

0:01:22.248,0:01:24.751
And Aridif will look at your energy,

0:01:24.751,0:01:27.420
he'll see any energy that it connects to,

0:01:27.629,0:01:30.965
your higher self, your oversoul, Archangels, whatever.

0:01:30.965,0:01:32.842
He'll see it connecting to it and then

0:01:33.009,0:01:34.552
he will be able to reflect it back

0:01:34.552,0:01:37.430
from his perception and his connections, so

0:01:37.639,0:01:38.890
remember to have fun!

0:01:38.890,0:01:41.267
Remember to enjoy yourselves and...

0:01:41.434,0:01:43.228
I love you guys.

0:01:45.438,0:01:56.074
(Oming sounds)

0:01:58.201,0:02:02.205
(Oming sounds)

0:02:04.415,0:02:06.668
Greetings to you all this is Aridif.

0:02:06.835,0:02:09.504
That is Ａ･Ｒ･Ｉ･Ｄ･Ｉ･Ｆ

0:02:09.504,0:02:11.256
and this is it spelled.

0:02:11.256,0:02:13.800
I know that many of you have queries of your own

0:02:13.800,0:02:16.344
in this evening, we will begin in one moment.

0:02:16.344,0:02:17.512
But first

0:02:17.512,0:02:19.681
we wish to discuss the co-creation of

0:02:19.681,0:02:21.808
the magnitude in which you have all placed

0:02:21.808,0:02:23.726
your own energy, that you have all

0:02:23.726,0:02:25.979
placed your own excitement and love,

0:02:25.979,0:02:27.689
time and effort into...

0:02:27.814,0:02:30.400
...making come to fruition for all others

0:02:30.400,0:02:33.653
in your experience, and outside of it, in this evening.

0:02:33.820,0:02:34.946
First of all,

0:02:35.113,0:02:36.573
when all of you understand that

0:02:36.573,0:02:38.199
many are aware of what is happening

0:02:38.199,0:02:40.118
in this moment, in this time

0:02:40.285,0:02:41.703
...but there are many who have no

0:02:41.703,0:02:43.705
concept or clue that this event

0:02:43.705,0:02:45.874
in the way it is happening, is happening

0:02:45.874,0:02:49.127
or that it is happening at all, in this evening.

0:02:49.294,0:02:52.046
But yet those who are around us are still affected

0:02:52.046,0:02:53.673
by your excitement,

0:02:53.673,0:02:57.302
by your co-creative collective consciousness.

0:02:57.302,0:03:00.013
By your own desires and excitement you build,

0:03:00.013,0:03:01.389
and this is what we have shared

0:03:01.389,0:03:02.807
from the beginning of the time

0:03:02.807,0:03:04.434
that we have come to Rob

0:03:04.601,0:03:06.477
and all of the time that we have connected to

0:03:06.477,0:03:07.645
Treb-BOR-yit-Ne

0:03:07.645,0:03:09.439
and all of humanity.

0:03:10.023,0:03:12.483
We've connected to humanity for thousands of years,

0:03:12.483,0:03:14.861
and different races of humans,

0:03:14.861,0:03:16.821
or different time periods of humans.

0:03:16.821,0:03:19.866
Different geography's than what we are now,

0:03:20.033,0:03:23.328
but we always have the capacity to teach and to share

0:03:23.328,0:03:26.414
what it is that we desire to teach and share

0:03:26.414,0:03:27.707
with all of you.

0:03:27.874,0:03:29.167
That is that you create

0:03:29.167,0:03:31.794
your own reality from thought.

0:03:31.794,0:03:34.380
You create your own reality

0:03:34.589,0:03:36.716
from your conscious mindset.

0:03:36.883,0:03:39.218
That in your co-creation with others

0:03:39.385,0:03:42.597
that you are creating not only the physical structure

0:03:42.597,0:03:43.598
around you

0:03:43.765,0:03:47.435
but all things that accompany the concepts

0:03:47.435,0:03:49.604
of exchanging energy.

0:03:49.771,0:03:51.773
Whether you are walking down the street

0:03:51.773,0:03:53.650
and seeing someone nod and wave,

0:03:53.775,0:03:58.363
that is a co-creation but it also created from yourself.

0:03:58.529,0:04:01.658
This dynamic is difficult for many humans to comprehend

0:04:01.658,0:04:03.952
"How are we able to create and co-create?"

0:04:04.118,0:04:06.412
"Is the one across from me, the one who is

0:04:06.412,0:04:09.207
being created or is co-creating with me?"

0:04:09.499,0:04:11.834
What we would say to this is, it does not matter!

0:04:12.043,0:04:14.379
What matters is your own excitement in the moment.

0:04:14.379,0:04:16.214
Your own ability to create

0:04:16.381,0:04:18.341
what you desire in each moment.

0:04:18.508,0:04:22.053
You take your energy and place it in many thought formats.

0:04:22.053,0:04:23.805
You place it in many thought forms

0:04:23.805,0:04:25.098
as you go through the day.

0:04:25.556,0:04:26.808
You think about the hardships

0:04:26.808,0:04:28.810
that you've had in your existence,

0:04:28.810,0:04:31.229
and that, because you are who you are,

0:04:31.396,0:04:32.939
and because of your history,

0:04:32.939,0:04:34.524
you should create more of that and

0:04:34.524,0:04:37.402
that is what your life is and you have settled for it.

0:04:37.527,0:04:39.237
But we understand that all of you

0:04:39.237,0:04:40.863
who are here in attendance

0:04:41.072,0:04:43.658
are starting to see greater aspects of yourself.

0:04:43.658,0:04:44.993
In each moment

0:04:45.118,0:04:47.286
you see yourself connecting

0:04:47.286,0:04:49.706
to other people who's excitement

0:04:49.706,0:04:52.709
matches. You're co-creating experiences

0:04:52.709,0:04:55.086
with entities who are not aware

0:04:55.253,0:04:58.631
of conscious mindset or what the word channeling means,

0:04:58.631,0:05:00.425
but yet you see them liven up,

0:05:00.591,0:05:02.051
you see their eyes sparkle,

0:05:02.051,0:05:03.886
you see them come to an excitement

0:05:04.095,0:05:07.849
in their own capacity to help co-create more excitement.

0:05:07.974,0:05:09.976
That is what this evening is about,

0:05:10.143,0:05:11.019
is excitement.

0:05:11.019,0:05:14.605
It is about creation, it is about co-creation.

0:05:14.856,0:05:17.567
What we have shared and what we will always share

0:05:17.734,0:05:20.695
is that we have a part in sharing our love with you.

0:05:20.695,0:05:23.156
You may do with it as you desire,

0:05:23.281,0:05:25.450
you may take the love that we send you

0:05:25.450,0:05:28.286
and use it for your own manifestations

0:05:28.286,0:05:31.205
of excitements, your own co-creations

0:05:31.205,0:05:33.291
or you may leave it at the door.

0:05:33.458,0:05:36.210
We do not mind what you do with the love we give you,

0:05:36.210,0:05:38.046
we just wish to send you this love.

0:05:38.046,0:05:41.090
And this is why we express in all time periods

0:05:41.090,0:05:43.926
that above all things that have been spoken of

0:05:43.926,0:05:45.553
in this evening by ourselves

0:05:45.553,0:05:49.307
is that you are loved is the most important point

0:05:49.766,0:05:51.726
When you say the words that you are loved,

0:05:51.726,0:05:54.228
it brings you an experience that feels different

0:05:54.228,0:05:57.607
than when someone expresses that I love you.

0:05:57.774,0:05:58.816
When I love you,

0:05:58.816,0:06:01.069
this means that two separate entities

0:06:01.235,0:06:03.279
that are segregated from one another

0:06:03.279,0:06:06.074
share love and send it to another person

0:06:06.074,0:06:07.325
who than accepts it but...

0:06:07.325,0:06:08.701
...when you are loved,

0:06:08.701,0:06:10.912
then that is all that needs to be said.

0:06:10.912,0:06:12.246
Love is around you.

0:06:12.455,0:06:14.499
If you desire it, you can accept it and

0:06:14.499,0:06:15.625
manifest with it.

0:06:16.042,0:06:17.877
Love is what creation is.

0:06:17.877,0:06:20.004
It is what all consciousness is made from.

0:06:20.004,0:06:21.923
And you as a non-physical entity

0:06:22.090,0:06:24.675
are aligned with that energy if you desire.

0:06:24.675,0:06:26.677
To realign with yourself,

0:06:26.886,0:06:30.181
all you must do is open yourself for the experience.

0:06:30.181,0:06:32.809
Now a part of that experience is understanding

0:06:32.809,0:06:34.394
things upon a deeper level.

0:06:34.769,0:06:37.021
So what we can share with you in this evening

0:06:37.021,0:06:39.315
is perhaps give you a reflection on

0:06:39.315,0:06:40.900
the questions you desire

0:06:41.067,0:06:43.945
in order to co-create a better understanding

0:06:44.070,0:06:47.031
for you to open your own energy up to the more love

0:06:47.031,0:06:48.866
around you if you desire.

0:06:48.866,0:06:52.370
And if you do not we are still here to share it.

0:06:52.537,0:06:55.039
You may begin with your queries at your leisure.

0:06:57.458,0:06:58.918
Ever wondered if their is intelligent

0:06:58.918,0:07:00.336
life elsewhere in the universe?

0:07:00.878,0:07:04.215
Well, I have, I've been wondering since I was a kid.

0:07:04.966,0:07:06.551
My name is Reuben Langdon.

0:07:06.551,0:07:10.930
And on March 29th, 2007, in the middle of the day,

0:07:10.930,0:07:15.059
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

0:07:15.059,0:07:16.561
Coincidentally, I was working on

0:07:16.561,0:07:18.813
the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

0:07:19.230,0:07:22.150
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

0:07:22.150,0:07:25.111
To find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

0:07:25.111,0:07:27.822
...are they here with us?

0:07:32.952,0:07:35.329
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

0:07:35.329,0:07:37.165
...what is their purpose?

0:07:37.165,0:07:39.876
Why don't they make themselves more known?

0:07:39.876,0:07:42.086
Why the secrecy?

0:07:42.086,0:07:44.338
I've asked these questions to many experts,

0:07:44.338,0:07:47.008
Yet, each seems to have a different theory.

0:07:47.300,0:07:49.468
So I thought to myself,

0:07:49.468,0:07:52.054
why not ask the aliens directly?

0:07:52.054,0:07:54.098
So that's what I've set out to do!

0:07:54.098,0:07:55.475
Well, sort of...

0:08:48.319,0:08:49.111
>> All right.

0:08:49.153,0:08:49.946
Well, here we are.

0:08:49.987,0:08:51.781
We're with Rob Gauthier.

0:08:51.781,0:08:56.244
And you channel a couple
of amazing beings.

0:08:56.244,0:08:58.579
More than a couple,
I should say.

0:08:58.579,0:09:00.081
How about you tell
us about yourself

0:09:00.081,0:09:03.417
and how did you get into this
whole channeling process?

0:09:03.501,0:09:05.544
>> Well, it's a bit of a story.

0:09:05.586,0:09:07.421
I always love explaining it.

0:09:07.463,0:09:11.592
But first, I was
a kid growing up

0:09:11.592,0:09:13.427
in a family that was
really Christian.

0:09:13.427,0:09:17.848
And Christianity was a big,
big part of my life as a child,

0:09:17.848,0:09:20.726
growing up into a
younger teenager.

0:09:20.768,0:09:24.397
At about 13, which is the
natural time of rebellion

0:09:24.397,0:09:27.400
for most, I kind of went
through this experience

0:09:27.400,0:09:30.027
where I separated
myself from it.

0:09:30.027,0:09:31.862
Growing up, I had
all these questions.

0:09:31.862,0:09:36.993
And every time I would ask the
preacher or a person esteemed

0:09:37.034,0:09:38.995
on the board of the
church directors,

0:09:39.036,0:09:41.330
or whoever, just someone
who is knowledgeable,

0:09:41.330,0:09:44.208
they never could really give an
answer that was complete to me.

0:09:44.250,0:09:47.295
It always seemed like
it just went back to,

0:09:47.295,0:09:51.173
because the Bible says so, or
because the church says so.

0:09:51.215,0:09:53.592
And I had a friend
who would go with me.

0:09:53.634,0:09:56.387
And we were both pretty
critical of the whole thing.

0:09:56.387,0:10:00.224
So after exploring that, I
kind of did my own thing.

0:10:00.224,0:10:03.561
I let science be
a big part of what

0:10:03.602,0:10:05.980
my reality was at that point.

0:10:06.022,0:10:08.733
In school, I did pretty
well with science.

0:10:08.733,0:10:09.525
I enjoyed it.

0:10:09.525,0:10:11.444
Earth science, especially.

0:10:11.485,0:10:14.113
And going through
that time period,

0:10:14.113,0:10:16.991
I distanced myself more
and more from the church.

0:10:17.033,0:10:20.286
After a few years,
I just quit going.

0:10:20.286,0:10:22.747
And not to my mother's
liking either.

0:10:22.747,0:10:25.082
But we just kept going through.

0:10:25.082,0:10:29.879
And after a few years of
just being off and about,

0:10:29.920,0:10:32.506
I started going through a
real, real rebellious stage.

0:10:32.506,0:10:36.886
And that was a very
disconnected time in my life.

0:10:36.927,0:10:39.513
I hung out with a
lot of people who--

0:10:39.555,0:10:41.432
they did the gang
things in the '90s.

0:10:41.432,0:10:43.643
So violence was part of that.

0:10:43.643,0:10:44.435
Drugs.

0:10:44.477,0:10:46.812
All of those things
were a big part.

0:10:46.812,0:10:49.523
I started smoking a lot of pot.

0:10:49.565,0:10:50.900
It wasn't an expansive thing.

0:10:50.900,0:10:52.485
It was fun.

0:10:52.526,0:10:53.694
So it was in my destructive--

0:10:53.736,0:10:54.403
>> It was a party thing.

0:10:54.445,0:10:55.154
>> Yes, it was.

0:10:55.154,0:10:55.905
Exactly.

0:10:55.905,0:10:56.697
>> Right.

0:10:56.739,0:10:59.742
Not Native American going
into the woods and--

0:10:59.742,0:11:00.785
>> No drumming circle.

0:11:00.826,0:11:04.497
>> No drumming circle, calling
in the Great Spirit Bear.

0:11:04.497,0:11:05.414
>> No.

0:11:05.498,0:11:08.417
But there were a lot of bears
there, just the wrong kind.

0:11:08.459,0:11:09.251
>> Right, right.

0:11:09.251,0:11:12.129
>> And it was fun.

0:11:12.129,0:11:14.673
And it was violent, destructive.

0:11:14.715,0:11:16.300
And it was a big
part of my life.

0:11:16.300,0:11:21.222
And I went that way until
right around the time

0:11:21.263,0:11:25.017
before I found out my son
was going to be on his way.

0:11:25.017,0:11:28.437
And I just kind of quit hanging
out with people a few months

0:11:28.437,0:11:29.480
before then.

0:11:29.522,0:11:32.400
Maybe it was intuition,
looking back.

0:11:32.400,0:11:33.859
>> A big responsibility coming.

0:11:33.859,0:11:35.986
>> Well, it was the first
time in my life I looked

0:11:35.986,0:11:40.074
at an aspect of something
that wasn't myself.

0:11:40.116,0:11:41.826
Everything was
centered around myself.

0:11:41.867,0:11:43.786
Even though I had
people who I loved

0:11:43.786,0:11:47.706
and were a part of my life,
up until then, it was just me.

0:11:47.706,0:11:50.376
And knowing this
responsibility--

0:11:50.418,0:11:51.836
the moment of
change really didn't

0:11:51.836,0:11:53.671
come till the day he was born.

0:11:53.712,0:11:57.341
He was born with a lot
of physical problems.

0:11:57.341,0:11:58.384
Cerebral palsy.

0:11:58.467,0:12:00.803
>> Did you know that right
away, right when he was born?

0:12:00.845,0:12:01.762
>> Not to the extent,

0:12:01.804,0:12:02.596
no.

0:12:02.596,0:12:04.098
They told us that
he had problems.

0:12:04.140,0:12:09.228
So when he came out, he did
not have any breath on his own.

0:12:09.228,0:12:10.730
They had to hook
him up to machines.

0:12:10.730,0:12:12.231
So I knew that
there was an issue.

0:12:12.273,0:12:14.150
But I didn't know the
extent of the issue.

0:12:14.150,0:12:15.109
>> I see.

0:12:15.109,0:12:18.070
>> They basically sent us home
and said, here's some medicine.

0:12:18.070,0:12:20.781
There's a possibility
he might have seizures.

0:12:20.823,0:12:24.535
We've seen some brain
waves that weren't normal.

0:12:24.535,0:12:26.245
So they sent me back.

0:12:26.245,0:12:28.038
And I took care of him.

0:12:28.080,0:12:30.249
And I didn't really
know the extent

0:12:30.249,0:12:32.918
of how bad it was
until he started

0:12:32.960,0:12:35.337
missing all the physical
marks. Like they'll say

0:12:35.337,0:12:37.256
at six months he's
supposed to lift his head,

0:12:37.298,0:12:39.550
and at three months, to do this.

0:12:39.550,0:12:40.593
And he missed all of them.

0:12:40.634,0:12:41.427
>> I see.

0:12:41.469,0:12:42.887
>> When he was
about two years old,

0:12:42.928,0:12:44.346
we took him back to the doctor.

0:12:44.346,0:12:45.598
And that's when I really knew.

0:12:45.598,0:12:48.809
And that's when the depression
in myself really started.

0:12:48.851,0:12:50.978
That's when the true
disconnection that I'd

0:12:51.020,0:12:53.647
experienced actually happened.

0:12:53.647,0:12:56.400
>> You were disconnected--
just the whole experience,

0:12:56.400,0:13:02.406
having a son in this state,
it was just hard to cope with?

0:13:02.490,0:13:03.282
>> Yeah.

0:13:03.282,0:13:05.159
It's the thought of knowing.

0:13:05.201,0:13:07.995
And when they tell me,
they don't tell me, hey,

0:13:07.995,0:13:08.913
your son has a problem.

0:13:08.954,0:13:11.749
They're like, he
has severe problems.

0:13:11.749,0:13:12.958
He'll never walk.

0:13:13.000,0:13:14.960
He'll never talk.

0:13:14.960,0:13:16.378
He'll probably be
like a vegetable.

0:13:16.420,0:13:18.672
And that's pretty much how
the doctor explained that.

0:13:18.756,0:13:19.548
>> Man.

0:13:19.548,0:13:20.424
Doctors.

0:13:20.424,0:13:21.217
>> Yeah, no bedside manner.

0:13:21.217,0:13:22.885
I know.

0:13:22.885,0:13:24.678
>> And then I guess,
they always say, well,

0:13:24.678,0:13:27.890
we're trained to tell
you the worst in case.

0:13:27.932,0:13:31.143
And that's not a good training.

0:13:31.185,0:13:32.102
>> Right.

0:13:32.102,0:13:35.064
Well, knowing what we know now
and what we thought, it's bad.

0:13:35.105,0:13:36.524
So it hit me like
a ton of bricks.

0:13:36.524,0:13:36.899
>> Sure.

0:13:36.899,0:13:37.691
Sure.

0:13:37.733,0:13:40.694
>> It was something that I
made myself try to cope with,

0:13:40.736,0:13:42.112
but I could not on my own.

0:13:42.112,0:13:42.905
>> Right.

0:13:42.947,0:13:45.449
>> I didn't have any
spiritual things in my life.

0:13:45.449,0:13:48.077
Before all I could
depend on was pot.

0:13:48.118,0:13:50.621
And that's what helped take the
edge off throughout my whole

0:13:50.621,0:13:51.956
teens and young 20's.

0:13:51.997,0:13:57.419
So from the time I found
out that my son's mother was

0:13:57.419,0:14:00.923
pregnant to the time he was
two, I had really pulled away

0:14:00.923,0:14:01.966
from my old lifestyle.

0:14:01.966,0:14:05.386
But now I immersed
back in it triplefold.

0:14:05.427,0:14:08.097
So it was more disconnection
than I ever experienced.

0:14:08.097,0:14:12.476
More-- my mind's going
crazy all the time.

0:14:12.518,0:14:14.895
No mental focus whatsoever.

0:14:14.937,0:14:16.730
So I go through that.

0:14:16.730,0:14:20.609
And it got real bad into the
depths of all sorts of things.

0:14:20.651,0:14:25.197
I even got into severe
drug use and pain--

0:14:25.197,0:14:28.117
I started with pain management
for a car crash I got into,

0:14:28.158,0:14:32.121
and it spiraled downhill
to the worst case scenario.

0:14:32.162,0:14:36.625
And after that, I spent many
years just kind of existing.

0:14:36.625,0:14:39.670
If I didn't get medicine,
I would be sick.

0:14:39.670,0:14:43.382
And my life really did
a tilt-a-whirl on me.

0:14:43.382,0:14:44.216
>> Right.

0:14:44.216,0:14:48.178
>> And that was the
worst time of my life.

0:14:48.220,0:14:51.932
And about seven
years into it, maybe

0:14:51.932,0:14:56.645
less than that, of really bad,
bad disconnection depression,

0:14:56.645,0:14:58.188
I finally started
coming out of it.

0:14:58.188,0:15:00.232
And I went through a lot
of steps to get there.

0:15:00.232,0:15:02.985
But the last step
included me actually

0:15:03.027,0:15:06.447
starting to see life again,
and starting to see--

0:15:06.488,0:15:08.532
and this is when I really
honed in on nature,

0:15:08.574,0:15:10.701
and I honed in on the animals.

0:15:10.701,0:15:13.162
Before I had pets, but
I never had an animal

0:15:13.162,0:15:14.747
that was connected to me.

0:15:14.788,0:15:17.958
I'd never seen it as an equal,
I'd seen it as property.

0:15:17.958,0:15:20.919
Those little changes
subtly creeped in.

0:15:20.919,0:15:23.297
And overnight it was just
an amazing difference

0:15:23.339,0:15:26.884
in perception, an amazing
difference in the way I felt.

0:15:26.884,0:15:29.595
And that's when my true
spiritual journey began.

0:15:29.595,0:15:32.514
That's when I really
started diving in.

0:15:32.556,0:15:37.227
One thing I always believed--
and science could not quench

0:15:37.227,0:15:40.773
my hunger for the desire
of how things started--

0:15:40.814,0:15:42.399
chemically, yes.

0:15:42.441,0:15:44.693
Engineering of the
universe, sure.

0:15:44.693,0:15:47.696
But never that god
that I knew was there.

0:15:47.696,0:15:48.489
>> Right.

0:15:48.489,0:15:51.033
>> So that was the one thing I
took into my beginning of this

0:15:51.033,0:15:52.576
spiritual journey, god.

0:15:52.618,0:15:55.788
And one thing too--
a lot of the times

0:15:55.788,0:16:00.167
during my whole life, UFOs,
ghosts, those two things

0:16:00.167,0:16:02.544
were really something
that my friend and I

0:16:02.544,0:16:04.380
had talked about all the time.

0:16:04.380,0:16:05.798
And there was never
an explanation

0:16:05.798,0:16:08.509
from the church or
science for either one.

0:16:08.509,0:16:11.303
And the afterlife
thing was always

0:16:11.345,0:16:12.471
something that amazed me.

0:16:12.471,0:16:15.015
I'd seen these
psychics on TV who

0:16:15.015,0:16:17.685
said I can talk to
spirits in the afterlife.

0:16:17.768,0:16:20.980
And I was very, very
skeptical, to say the least.

0:16:20.980,0:16:23.732
But some of the things they
would say would be profound.

0:16:23.732,0:16:26.068
And I thought, that's
a starting point.

0:16:26.068,0:16:27.986
Let's look into that.

0:16:28.028,0:16:31.448
I found a church that
integrated their desire

0:16:31.448,0:16:34.118
to look on the
other side of death,

0:16:34.118,0:16:37.579
so that they could bring
answers from the other side.

0:16:37.621,0:16:39.164
And they believe in God.

0:16:39.164,0:16:40.749
And they followed a
bit of the Bible

0:16:40.791,0:16:43.168
too, which was a comfort
zone, I guess, for me

0:16:43.168,0:16:44.795
from my childhood belief.

0:16:44.837,0:16:46.171
So I jumped in.

0:16:46.171,0:16:49.174
And when I went there,
they taught me meditation.

0:16:49.174,0:16:50.718
Right off the bat,
I got a reading

0:16:50.718,0:16:53.429
from the person, the
deacon, or the pastor,

0:16:53.470,0:16:55.639
whatever title he had,

0:16:55.681,0:16:57.015
and it was spot on.

0:16:57.015,0:16:57.808
He didn't know me.

0:16:57.808,0:16:59.643
No one from the church knew me.

0:16:59.685,0:17:02.187
No one had my social
media profile.

0:17:02.229,0:17:04.565
But yet, they told me
things about my son.

0:17:04.565,0:17:06.275
And they told me
things about relatives

0:17:06.316,0:17:07.735
that, at first, I had no clue.

0:17:07.776,0:17:11.613
But when I went to my
dad, who follows genealogy

0:17:11.613,0:17:13.866
and our family
tree. He said: Wow,

0:17:13.866,0:17:18.203
this person from six generations
ago had this and this.

0:17:18.245,0:17:19.455
So it was perfect.

0:17:19.538,0:17:20.706
>> So it matched up.

0:17:20.706,0:17:21.498
>> Synchronicity.

0:17:21.498,0:17:23.375
And it hit me so
hard that he could

0:17:23.375,0:17:25.294
have that kind of information.

0:17:25.335,0:17:27.504
That drew a level
of reality to me.

0:17:27.504,0:17:29.381
It drew some realness to it.

0:17:29.423,0:17:30.466
>> Well, just to back up.

0:17:30.466,0:17:33.969
When you said you started
noticing the animals

0:17:34.011,0:17:37.306
or I guess your perspective
on animals had changed,

0:17:37.306,0:17:39.433
was there a specific
event or something

0:17:39.433,0:17:40.934
that made that happen,

0:17:40.976,0:17:41.977
or did it just happen?

0:17:42.019,0:17:44.104
>> It was a lot
of little things.

0:17:44.146,0:17:47.775
For instance, the way my dogs
would come to me, instead

0:17:47.775,0:17:48.942
of just kind of--

0:17:48.942,0:17:50.360
they would always come
to get petted or something,

0:17:50.402,0:17:52.196
but they would come
and spend time with me.

0:17:52.196,0:17:53.197
Little things like that.

0:17:53.197,0:17:53.989
>> I see.

0:17:54.031,0:17:55.491
>> Going out in the woods.

0:17:55.491,0:17:57.701
As a younger person, I hunted.

0:17:57.701,0:17:58.660
It's Michigan culture.

0:17:58.702,0:18:00.037
>> Yeah.
>> I was raised here.

0:18:00.037,0:18:00.829
>> Right.

0:18:00.829,0:18:02.498
>> So I hunted all the time.

0:18:02.539,0:18:06.043
And the last time I went hunting
was right around that time.

0:18:06.085,0:18:07.795
I had a deer right in my sights.

0:18:07.795,0:18:09.838
I actually fell
asleep in the woods.

0:18:09.838,0:18:12.466
And I woke up, and this
deer is five foot from me.

0:18:12.466,0:18:14.760
And I had my gun,
unlocked the trigger,

0:18:14.760,0:18:17.179
put it right on the deer, and
I couldn't pull the trigger.

0:18:17.179,0:18:19.848
And after that, I never
went back out in the woods.

0:18:19.890,0:18:21.433
Those types of things.

0:18:21.475,0:18:23.393
Very hard, very big.

0:18:23.393,0:18:25.062
But a lot of little
things that led up

0:18:25.104,0:18:28.982
to it that really made me
understand what that connection

0:18:28.982,0:18:33.028
was a bit more than just
the animal-human perspective

0:18:33.070,0:18:36.281
that Christianity, and just
humans in general, believe in.

0:18:36.323,0:18:37.282
>> I see.

0:18:37.324,0:18:39.243
I remember you mentioned
before that you

0:18:39.243,0:18:44.331
had gotten involved with some
recordings from the Monroe

0:18:44.373,0:18:45.207
Institute.

0:18:45.207,0:18:45.791
>> Yes.

0:18:45.791,0:18:47.417
I would meditate all the time.

0:18:47.459,0:18:49.586
And I kept gaining
more experiences.

0:18:49.586,0:18:51.839
And I finally just kind
of pooped out on it,

0:18:51.880,0:18:53.549
and it just stopped.

0:18:53.549,0:18:56.218
After that, I started
looking online.

0:18:56.260,0:18:59.012
And that's when I found
the Monroe Institute.

0:18:59.012,0:19:00.597
I found some binaural stuff.

0:19:00.639,0:19:03.183
And then I found
Hemi-Sync, which was

0:19:03.225,0:19:05.394
the biggest and best out there.

0:19:05.394,0:19:06.687
It's what was claimed.

0:19:06.728,0:19:07.521
>> Right.

0:19:07.521,0:19:09.773
>> I started the Gateway
Experience course,

0:19:09.815,0:19:12.025
which was a six course--

0:19:12.025,0:19:16.738
six part per course, and then
six courses of meditation,

0:19:16.738,0:19:20.909
which increased my meditation
ability tremendously.

0:19:20.909,0:19:23.704
This is where all of the astral
projection states come in.

0:19:23.745,0:19:26.373
This is where all of the
out of body experiences--

0:19:26.373,0:19:30.419
it took my meditation to
such a level beyond anything

0:19:30.460,0:19:32.629
I thought was possible
at that point.

0:19:32.629,0:19:34.840
I had only used
meditation before to try

0:19:34.840,0:19:38.802
to open myself for communication
with spirits, dead humans.

0:19:38.802,0:19:39.970
That's all I cared about.

0:19:39.970,0:19:40.387
>> Oh, you did.

0:19:40.387,0:19:41.180
OK.

0:19:41.221,0:19:42.890
>> That was my intent
in my meditation.

0:19:42.890,0:19:45.058
>> When you were in church,
still with the church?

0:19:45.142,0:19:45.767
>> Yes.
>> OK.

0:19:45.809,0:19:48.729
The, the spirits was what
their church was involved with.

0:19:48.729,0:19:50.647
That was the whole focal
point of their church,

0:19:50.689,0:19:53.442
was to communicate with
people who had died to give

0:19:53.483,0:19:55.068
proof of afterlife.

0:19:55.068,0:19:55.861
>> I see.

0:19:55.861,0:19:57.404
>> And that was important to me.

0:19:57.404,0:20:00.282
And I thought that wasn't the
only intent for meditation.

0:20:00.324,0:20:01.116
>> Right.

0:20:01.116,0:20:05.662
>> My meditation came because,
like drugs helped pull me out

0:20:05.662,0:20:09.499
of pain and suffering, this new
excitement I found whenever I

0:20:09.541,0:20:12.836
would start to go down and
start to feel a little cruddy

0:20:12.836,0:20:15.589
or start getting back in
those low points again,

0:20:15.631,0:20:17.257
I would use meditation.

0:20:17.257,0:20:20.052
And it brought me to a new level
of feeling good, and excited,

0:20:20.052,0:20:21.637
and clear.

0:20:21.637,0:20:26.183
And I used it like I used to
use drugs, several times a day,

0:20:26.224,0:20:27.809
as much as I could.

0:20:27.809,0:20:30.604
The quantity, the quality
was important to me.

0:20:30.604,0:20:33.065
So I kept using
meditation as a tool

0:20:33.106,0:20:36.193
to help alleviate all
that stress and stuff.

0:20:36.193,0:20:40.530
So that coupled with
that contact of people

0:20:40.572,0:20:41.657
who had passed on.

0:20:41.657,0:20:44.868
Those were the real focus
points of my meditation.

0:20:44.868,0:20:47.037
And the Hemi-Sync took
me above and beyond that.

0:20:47.079,0:20:48.914
>> And can you describe
how it did that?

0:20:48.956,0:20:50.999
Or is that something you
have to buy the Hemi-Sync

0:20:51.041,0:20:51.833
and go through?

0:20:51.833,0:20:52.918
Is there--

0:20:52.960,0:20:54.753
>> It's a several step process.

0:20:54.795,0:20:58.924
So the teachings are
just tools to use.

0:20:58.966,0:21:03.136
And the vibration sounds,
basically, they sync up

0:21:03.178,0:21:04.805
your hemispheres of the brain.

0:21:04.805,0:21:05.597
>> OK.

0:21:05.639,0:21:08.475
Yeah, because binaural
beats and Hemi-Sync,

0:21:08.475,0:21:10.978
it's based on the same
concept of different tones

0:21:11.019,0:21:11.895
in different ears.

0:21:11.937,0:21:12.354
>> Yes.

0:21:12.354,0:21:13.146
Exactly.

0:21:13.146,0:21:16.233
And some of them,
and not Hemi-Sync.

0:21:16.275,0:21:17.192
I used other ones.

0:21:17.234,0:21:19.361
But Hemi-Sync was the one
that gave me technique.

0:21:19.361,0:21:20.862
Those teach you techniques.

0:21:20.862,0:21:21.113
>> Right.

0:21:21.113,0:21:22.823
>> They teach you
healing, out-of-body,

0:21:22.823,0:21:25.242
communication with
spirit, all of those.

0:21:25.325,0:21:29.496
And with those, I was
able to jump through.

0:21:29.496,0:21:32.791
Now, the experiences themselves
were so vast, and different

0:21:32.833,0:21:35.127
kinds of experiences.

0:21:35.127,0:21:37.629
The first day I started, there
was a vibration in my body

0:21:37.671,0:21:39.423
I never felt before.

0:21:39.423,0:21:41.133
It made my whole body [BUZZING].

0:21:41.133,0:21:44.011
And the chakras were
just high vibrational.

0:21:44.052,0:21:45.846
And those types of
experiences were

0:21:45.887,0:21:47.055
what hooked me in right away.

0:21:47.097,0:21:47.889
>> Wow.

0:21:47.889,0:21:49.433
>> I was skeptical,
to say the least.

0:21:49.433,0:21:51.476
So I started with
my first one saying,

0:21:51.518,0:21:52.686
well, we'll see what it does.

0:21:52.728,0:21:53.895
And the first one was a hit.

0:21:53.895,0:21:54.938
So I just kept going.

0:21:54.980,0:21:55.772
>> Wow.

0:21:55.772,0:21:57.691
>> The experience itself--

0:21:57.733,0:22:00.444
normally, I suggest to people,
if you do the Hemi-Sync,

0:22:00.444,0:22:02.487
go through it at your own pace.

0:22:02.529,0:22:04.990
But I would suggest no
less than six months,

0:22:04.990,0:22:07.826
no less than a year
to go through all six.

0:22:07.868,0:22:09.745
For me, I jumped through
them in four months.

0:22:09.745,0:22:10.537
>> Wow.

0:22:10.537,0:22:12.581
>> And I thought it
was way too quick.

0:22:12.622,0:22:14.291
But everything
happens for a reason.

0:22:14.291,0:22:15.083
>> Right.

0:22:15.083,0:22:17.544
>> And it worked out well.

0:22:17.544,0:22:20.756
>> So that led you into
the channeling state?

0:22:20.839,0:22:23.050
Or did you get to talk
to spirits, I should say?

0:22:23.050,0:22:26.178
>> I never got real contact with
spirits in the way I wanted to.

0:22:26.178,0:22:26.970
>> OK.

0:22:27.012,0:22:29.973
>> But my belief system then
was I should be hearing them

0:22:29.973,0:22:32.893
in my ears, like
audioclairancy or something.

0:22:32.893,0:22:34.394
And that should
be the experience.

0:22:34.394,0:22:38.148
But I had gotten
pictures or ideas.

0:22:38.190,0:22:41.193
And that really never happened
in the Gateway Experience.

0:22:41.193,0:22:42.944
There were times
where I was able--

0:22:42.986,0:22:44.738
>> Gateway is the church, or no?

0:22:44.738,0:22:46.156
>> No, Gateway
was the Hemi-Sync.

0:22:46.156,0:22:46.948
>> Oh, OK.

0:22:46.990,0:22:51.078
>> That part really never gave
me any kind of spirit contact.

0:22:51.078,0:22:53.372
Although, I do know
that I was connecting

0:22:53.413,0:22:54.664
to different energies.

0:22:54.706,0:22:58.418
Maybe not aware in the
moment, questioning that.

0:22:58.418,0:23:00.337
And that was something
the church had helped me

0:23:00.378,0:23:02.923
with before, to stop
questioning myself,

0:23:02.964,0:23:06.051
because that's a big, big part
of tapping into your intuition.

0:23:06.051,0:23:07.719
>> Right.

0:23:07.761,0:23:08.804
>> So I go through these.

0:23:08.804,0:23:11.056
And I get all sorts
of experiences,

0:23:11.056,0:23:13.600
out-of-body experiences,
not controlled.

0:23:13.642,0:23:16.061
And I still-- to this
day, I can astral project,

0:23:16.061,0:23:18.396
but I can't tell
myself where to go.

0:23:18.438,0:23:20.273
I can't say, I want
to go down the street

0:23:20.273,0:23:22.484
and hang out in the
bar in spirit form.

0:23:22.526,0:23:23.527
I can't do that.

0:23:23.568,0:23:24.361
>> Oh, I see.

0:23:24.361,0:23:26.154
But you can shoot
out of your body.

0:23:26.154,0:23:26.947
>> Oh, yeah.

0:23:26.988,0:23:27.948
>> And then it just kind of--

0:23:27.948,0:23:29.741
>> Every time I
connect in channeling,

0:23:29.783,0:23:30.784
that's what I'm doing.

0:23:30.784,0:23:32.661
>> And then you just--
it just floats around,

0:23:32.661,0:23:35.038
and you're just kind of
observing whatever appears

0:23:35.038,0:23:36.123
to you?
Or how does that--

0:23:36.123,0:23:38.166
>> Well, I've had
experiences like that.

0:23:38.208,0:23:41.545
But most of time, it's like
an experience going out

0:23:41.586,0:23:43.296
into a different
environment altogether.

0:23:43.296,0:23:44.631
I've experienced other planets.

0:23:44.631,0:23:49.302
I've experienced other parts of
reality here, different times.

0:23:49.302,0:23:52.264
But how I connected
to TReb was different.

0:23:52.264,0:23:54.391
I had not had an
out-of-body that

0:23:54.391,0:24:00.272
was severely powerful or very,
very deep in meaning to me.

0:24:00.313,0:24:03.525
And I had a real messed
up night that night.

0:24:03.525,0:24:06.153
I watched the Hubble
Deep space thing

0:24:06.153,0:24:08.738
for the first time, the 3D
one that they had on YouTube.

0:24:08.738,0:24:09.531
>> Oh, yeah.

0:24:09.573,0:24:12.701
>> And it touched my heart, but
it kind of made me feel empty,

0:24:12.701,0:24:14.369
like I can't go out there.

0:24:14.369,0:24:16.246
I can't be a part of that.

0:24:16.246,0:24:18.582
And it really kind of made
me depressed a little.

0:24:18.623,0:24:21.251
So I used a meditation.

0:24:21.293,0:24:24.796
In the Hemi-Sync, they go
through steps 1 through 21.

0:24:24.796,0:24:28.049
And I decided one night, well,
why don't I just go past 21.

0:24:28.091,0:24:30.093
And that was that
night of depression.

0:24:30.093,0:24:31.261
And that's when I met TReb.

0:24:31.303,0:24:33.597
And when I met TReb, it was--

0:24:33.638,0:24:37.726
>> Steps 1 through 21, and what
do you mean by going past 21?

0:24:37.726,0:24:39.728
Do they have actually
steps after 21?

0:24:39.769,0:24:40.312
>> No.
>> Oh.

0:24:40.312,0:24:41.730
>> They do 1 through 21.

0:24:41.813,0:24:44.316
And basically, when you're
meditating, you're counting.

0:24:44.357,0:24:45.525
It's a self-hypnosis.

0:24:45.525,0:24:46.985
That's what meditation is.

0:24:47.027,0:24:48.445
It's a self-hypnosis.

0:24:48.445,0:24:51.990
And each step that you
take, you go deeper in.

0:24:52.032,0:24:56.203
So step 1, you're starting
to feel less your body,

0:24:56.244,0:24:57.454
and then it goes on.

0:24:57.454,0:24:59.122
So I went past the 21.

0:24:59.122,0:25:01.291
And that's the maximum of
the Gateway Experience,

0:25:01.291,0:25:03.376
is the 21st--

0:25:03.376,0:25:04.753
They call it the 21 state.

0:25:04.794,0:25:05.587
>> What's at 21?

0:25:05.629,0:25:06.796
Can you reveal what's at 21?

0:25:06.796,0:25:09.841
>> Well, 21 state is
basically a full-blown conscious

0:25:09.841,0:25:10.592
integration.

0:25:10.592,0:25:12.135
You can connect with
your higher self.

0:25:12.177,0:25:13.470
You can leave your body.

0:25:13.511,0:25:16.014
At that point, you're at the
deepest level of consciousness

0:25:16.014,0:25:16.848
available.

0:25:16.890,0:25:19.059
>> And did you kind of in
your own mind then say OK,

0:25:19.100,0:25:20.227
we're going 22.

0:25:20.227,0:25:21.019
>> Yeah.

0:25:21.061,0:25:23.230
And I just-- and it
wasn't even a number.

0:25:23.230,0:25:24.272
I didn't go 22, 23.

0:25:24.314,0:25:25.106
>> Right.

0:25:25.106,0:25:26.816
>> I just went beyond.

0:25:26.858,0:25:28.360
Now, it's time to go beyond.

0:25:28.360,0:25:29.653
And I did it in the moment.

0:25:29.694,0:25:30.487
>> Through the veil.

0:25:30.528,0:25:32.239
>> Not deciding
before, in the moment,

0:25:32.239,0:25:33.740
and that's when I
connected to TReb,

0:25:33.740,0:25:34.532
right then.

0:25:34.574,0:25:35.367
>> Wow!

0:25:35.367,0:25:39.371
>> Now when I'm connecting to
TReb, this is very surreal.

0:25:39.412,0:25:41.206
It's very realistic.

0:25:41.248,0:25:43.416
It's just like me and you
sitting here talking today.

0:25:43.500,0:25:44.918
And that's the
first time I'd ever

0:25:44.918,0:25:46.503
left my body in such a fashion.

0:25:46.503,0:25:47.295
>> Wow.

0:25:47.295,0:25:50.632
>> Before when I left my body,
there would be tracers or sound

0:25:50.674,0:25:54.010
would be gone, or the images
were blurry, or vibrating.

0:25:54.010,0:25:57.847
It was always different,
but never this clear.

0:25:57.847,0:25:58.848
I was on a ship.

0:25:58.890,0:26:01.601
I know that much now, because
I've been back to those ships

0:26:01.601,0:26:02.394
before.

0:26:02.394,0:26:05.105
It was one of the Yit ships,
which is TReb's people.

0:26:05.146,0:26:08.525
And I was sitting there
in a room by myself.

0:26:08.525,0:26:10.902
And eventually, through
the door comes TReb.

0:26:10.944,0:26:14.698
And this, it scared
the shit out of me.

0:26:14.739,0:26:18.243
It was a horribly
menacing being that was--

0:26:18.285,0:26:20.412
you're looking up
to, 7 and 1/2 foot.

0:26:20.412,0:26:22.414
I'm sitting in this
chair, and I'm instantly

0:26:22.414,0:26:23.707
transported sitting in a chair.

0:26:23.707,0:26:27.586
I always joke, it's like a
futuristic space doctor waiting

0:26:27.627,0:26:29.296
room, because you're
just sitting there.

0:26:29.296,0:26:31.423
And there is a sign that
has this writing over here

0:26:31.423,0:26:32.465
to the right.

0:26:32.465,0:26:33.925
And it's not written in English.

0:26:33.925,0:26:36.261
But after looking at it
long enough, I could tell.

0:26:36.261,0:26:39.764
And it basically says something
to the effect: Just sit here,

0:26:39.764,0:26:41.725
and someone will be with
you soon, type thing.

0:26:41.808,0:26:42.892
And I laughed about that.

0:26:42.892,0:26:44.728
I still-- I don't
know if I made--

0:26:44.769,0:26:45.895
>> You interpreted it.

0:26:45.895,0:26:47.897
You interpreted it as sit here.

0:26:47.897,0:26:48.732
OK.

0:26:48.773,0:26:49.566
>> And I wait.

0:26:49.566,0:26:52.902
And this big gigantic
reptilian, blue green,

0:26:52.944,0:26:57.324
gigantic teeth, huge purple
eyes, just comes through.

0:26:57.407,0:26:59.534
>> Now, I'll jump ahead
just for a second.

0:26:59.576,0:27:02.912
When I come back, I
think I am insane.

0:27:02.912,0:27:04.914
I think something's
wrong with me.

0:27:04.956,0:27:08.752
I think the Hemi-Sync gave me
a brain aneurysm, or something,

0:27:08.752,0:27:10.337
because this is not real.

0:27:10.378,0:27:12.005
>> It's a crazy
psychedelic experience.

0:27:12.005,0:27:12.339
>> Yeah.

0:27:12.339,0:27:13.214
>> Beyond psychedelic

0:27:13.256,0:27:15.634
>> Beyond anything you
could ingest, entheogens,

0:27:15.634,0:27:16.426
any of that.

0:27:16.426,0:27:17.260
>> Oh, wow.

0:27:17.302,0:27:21.473
>> The silver suit, he even wore
a silver robe and gold boots.

0:27:21.514,0:27:23.850
And I'm thinking to
myself, if I were trying

0:27:23.850,0:27:27.604
to pull out the cheesiest
space futuristic suit,

0:27:27.645,0:27:28.438
what would it be?

0:27:28.438,0:27:29.522
And that's it.

0:27:29.522,0:27:30.440
And that's what he was wearing.

0:27:30.482,0:27:30.815
>> Wow.

0:27:30.815,0:27:31.608
>> He comes to me.

0:27:31.650,0:27:32.901
And it's this gigantic thing.

0:27:32.901,0:27:34.110
And I'm scared.

0:27:34.152,0:27:36.738
And I felt my energy
tighten up like a ball.

0:27:36.780,0:27:39.699
And it was very scary for
only a couple of seconds.

0:27:39.699,0:27:41.159
And after that, it dissipated.

0:27:41.159,0:27:43.495
I felt this huge sense of love.

0:27:43.536,0:27:44.788
I was able to relax.

0:27:44.788,0:27:50.543
It was almost like--

0:27:50.543,0:27:52.629
I'm trying to think--

0:27:52.629,0:27:54.756
OK, it was almost
like a sedative

0:27:54.798,0:27:57.884
at the doctor, that just
relaxed the body and the mind.

0:27:57.884,0:27:58.927
And then he came in.

0:27:58.968,0:28:01.054
And he said that
he was connected

0:28:01.054,0:28:04.641
to me, that me and him were
connected and supposed to meet.

0:28:04.682,0:28:06.059
He told me a lot
of things that I

0:28:06.059,0:28:09.479
think I know about reality
aren't necessarily the way,

0:28:09.479,0:28:10.855
there's a lot more to it.

0:28:10.855,0:28:13.024
He explained different
levels of consciousness.

0:28:13.108,0:28:14.651
He explained
different dimensions.

0:28:14.692,0:28:16.569
He explained--
>> All this in this one meeting?

0:28:16.611,0:28:19.114
>> In the first meeting, and
the first time I ever talked

0:28:19.114,0:28:19.823
to him.
>> Wow.

0:28:19.823,0:28:20.865
>> And he didn't go detailed.

0:28:20.907,0:28:22.659
Now, I didn't have the
terminology either.

0:28:22.701,0:28:23.493
>> Right.

0:28:23.493,0:28:26.996
>> And the way telepathy
works is that when--

0:28:27.038,0:28:30.041
they're using your words
to try to convey a message.

0:28:30.041,0:28:32.711
And you don't necessarily
get words per se.

0:28:32.711,0:28:34.671
It's just kind of
a group thought.

0:28:34.712,0:28:36.256
All of this coming
to me at once.

0:28:36.256,0:28:39.718
And it was so overwhelming
and so powerful

0:28:39.718,0:28:41.720
that it was hard to
remember a lot of the things

0:28:41.761,0:28:44.097
that we talked about the
first couple of times.

0:28:44.139,0:28:46.808
But the first time, I remember
it like it was yesterday.

0:28:46.850,0:28:48.309
It was so clear.

0:28:48.309,0:28:50.854
And he explains, it's
not what you think,

0:28:50.854,0:28:52.230
all these levels.

0:28:52.272,0:28:54.190
And he said, I'm here.

0:28:54.190,0:28:55.066
I'm here for you.

0:28:55.066,0:28:57.152
If you want to connect
to me, I'm here.

0:28:57.193,0:28:57.986
And I left.

0:28:57.986,0:29:00.530
And now, at this time, when
I started the Hemi-Sync,

0:29:00.572,0:29:01.614
I was full-blast.

0:29:01.656,0:29:06.494
I'm three times a day meditation
for an hour, an hour 25 each.

0:29:06.494,0:29:10.582
Plus using closed-eye technique,
where I'm just turning sounds

0:29:10.623,0:29:13.668
into vibrations and energy,
and understanding that.

0:29:13.668,0:29:17.380
It's kind of a self-taught
technique that I taught myself.

0:29:17.380,0:29:21.384
>> Basically, after learning
these meditations I would

0:29:21.384,0:29:23.803
utilize, I was
hooked on meditation.

0:29:23.803,0:29:27.599
And in my mind, to miss
a day of meditation

0:29:27.682,0:29:30.185
is like missing
breathing oxygen.

0:29:30.226,0:29:34.230
But after that, it was
so intense and so odd,

0:29:34.230,0:29:37.692
I skipped meditating for over
four days before I reconnected.

0:29:37.692,0:29:38.860
>> After the TReb experience.

0:29:38.902,0:29:39.694
>> Yes.

0:29:39.736,0:29:44.407
And after that point, I
was hesitant to go back.

0:29:44.407,0:29:46.951
And I questioned myself
more than I did just

0:29:46.951,0:29:47.994
about any time in my life.

0:29:48.036,0:29:49.329
Even more than the--

0:29:49.329,0:29:50.580
>> Questioning your sanity.

0:29:50.622,0:29:54.375
>> Yes, my sanity, everything.

0:29:54.417,0:29:56.753
I had talked to my ex-wife,

0:29:56.795,0:29:58.588
she was my wife then, about it.

0:29:58.588,0:30:01.674
And she said, this meditation
is doing something to you

0:30:01.716,0:30:02.509
probably.

0:30:02.550,0:30:05.053
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

0:30:05.094,0:30:05.970
You seem lucid.

0:30:06.012,0:30:07.472
You seem OK.

0:30:07.472,0:30:08.515
So finally I...

0:30:08.556,0:30:11.100
>> And the rest of your life was
getting better at this point,

0:30:11.184,0:30:12.435
because of the meditations?

0:30:12.435,0:30:13.603
>> Oh, yes, yes.

0:30:13.603,0:30:16.189
By this time, I had already
spent several months

0:30:16.272,0:30:19.317
with the church, several months
after the church meditating.

0:30:19.317,0:30:21.236
So my life was really
getting smooth again.

0:30:21.277,0:30:25.490
>> And relationships, and
your son, and your viewpoint,

0:30:25.532,0:30:26.825
and all that was getting better?

0:30:26.908,0:30:27.325
>> Yes.

0:30:27.325,0:30:28.576
It was getting a lot
better at that point.

0:30:28.576,0:30:29.076
>> OK.

0:30:29.077,0:30:31.955
So you knew the meditations were
working, not in a negative way,

0:30:32.038,0:30:33.248
but in a positive way.

0:30:33.248,0:30:33.748
>> Sure.

0:30:33.748,0:30:34.541
Sure.

0:30:34.541,0:30:36.417
And it became so
much a part of me.

0:30:36.459,0:30:40.171
I hated to miss those four
days, but I was just so,

0:30:40.213,0:30:45.218
so questioning myself, and if
I should keep going with this.

0:30:45.218,0:30:48.221
And it was a big question
mark at that point.

0:30:48.263,0:30:50.265
But the question remained.

0:30:50.306,0:30:51.432
Can I do this again?

0:30:51.432,0:30:52.350
Can I meet this being?

0:30:52.350,0:30:53.810
Can I ask him questions?

0:30:53.810,0:30:56.479
Because I really didn't get a
lot of chance to talk and ask

0:30:56.521,0:30:57.313
questions.

0:30:57.313,0:30:59.816
It was more of him saying,
hey, this, this, and this.

0:30:59.816,0:31:00.608
>> Right.

0:31:00.608,0:31:02.652
>> Are your ears open?

0:31:02.694,0:31:04.404
Yes, they are open now.

0:31:04.404,0:31:07.699
So I go back, and I meditate.

0:31:07.699,0:31:09.200
>> You go through the 21 cycle.

0:31:09.200,0:31:09.617
>> Yes,
and I go past them.

0:31:09.617,0:31:10.535
>> Now the 22 cycles.

0:31:10.577,0:31:11.119
>> Yes.

0:31:11.160,0:31:12.996
>> So now you know how to
get there through this--

0:31:12.996,0:31:13.997
>> Easily now.

0:31:13.997,0:31:16.499
>> Through this process.

0:31:16.541,0:31:17.333
>> Yes.

0:31:17.333,0:31:20.920
And the part of me
that was hesitant

0:31:20.962,0:31:22.255
said, I'm just going to do it.

0:31:22.255,0:31:23.798
And I went past.

0:31:23.840,0:31:26.301
I reconnected to him two
or three times after that,

0:31:26.342,0:31:27.969
just basic conversations.

0:31:27.969,0:31:29.387
Who are you?

0:31:29.387,0:31:31.431
>> And it was just as
visceral as the first one?

0:31:31.472,0:31:32.265
>> Yes.

0:31:32.265,0:31:33.057
>> Each time?

0:31:33.057,0:31:36.144
>> Each one just as vividly
as the last, just as real,

0:31:36.185,0:31:38.187
just as strong.

0:31:38.229,0:31:39.731
Each time it got
a little easier.

0:31:39.731,0:31:41.316
But about the fourth
or fifth time--

0:31:41.357,0:31:44.360
>> It got easier to get there,
or just the whole experience?

0:31:44.360,0:31:47.280
>> On my own sanity, on
my questioning myself,

0:31:47.280,0:31:48.197
it got a little easier.

0:31:48.239,0:31:49.407
>> I see.
I see.

0:31:49.407,0:31:50.700
>> It wasn't so jolting.

0:31:50.742,0:31:51.743
>> Right.

0:31:51.743,0:31:52.535
OK.

0:31:52.535,0:31:55.997
>> And it was jolting the
first time, the second, third.

0:31:56.039,0:31:57.206
I go, and I--

0:31:57.206,0:31:59.792
the fourth, fifth time
I go, and I ask him,

0:31:59.834,0:32:01.127
how do I know you're real?

0:32:01.127,0:32:03.546
How do I know I'm
not going crazy?

0:32:03.588,0:32:06.466
How do I know something's
not wrong with my mind?

0:32:06.466,0:32:08.343
And he said, talk
to your friend.

0:32:08.384,0:32:10.303
And this is the same
friend who I grew up with,

0:32:10.345,0:32:12.347
the same friend, Scott,
a dear friend of mine

0:32:12.388,0:32:13.389
since we were kids.

0:32:13.431,0:32:14.223
>> Right.

0:32:14.223,0:32:16.267
>> How do I know you're real?

0:32:16.309,0:32:17.644
He said, go talk to Scott.

0:32:17.644,0:32:19.896
And when you do, don't
tell him about me,

0:32:19.896,0:32:22.106
just talk to him as your friend.

0:32:22.148,0:32:25.234
And there should be something
in there that will help you.

0:32:25.234,0:32:27.195
And I go, OK.

0:32:27.236,0:32:30.031
No later than a day, my friend
gets a hold of me, and says:

0:32:30.031,0:32:32.450
Hey, I've got this really
cool UFO documentary

0:32:32.450,0:32:33.242
I've been watching.

0:32:33.242,0:32:34.577
It's really amazing.

0:32:34.577,0:32:37.121
He sends me the link
to it, and I watch it.

0:32:37.163,0:32:39.499
And on that documentary,
they started

0:32:39.540,0:32:41.334
talking about channeling.

0:32:41.376,0:32:42.251
Now--

0:32:42.293,0:32:43.920
>> So you didn't know
about channeling.

0:32:43.961,0:32:45.254
>> Nothing about channeling.

0:32:45.254,0:32:47.548
I knew about mediumship
from the church.

0:32:47.590,0:32:48.383
>> Right.

0:32:48.383,0:32:49.884
>> That's what their
whole deal was,

0:32:49.884,0:32:53.012
but I never heard
the term channeling.

0:32:53.054,0:32:55.139
And although I had
seen it in the church--

0:32:55.139,0:32:57.350
people getting messages
directly through them--

0:32:57.350,0:32:58.726
I never knew
exactly what it was.

0:32:58.726,0:32:59.519
>> I see.

0:32:59.560,0:33:01.980
>> I just thought that was
that medium's way of bringing

0:33:01.980,0:33:02.980
in the information.

0:33:02.980,0:33:03.981
>> Sure.

0:33:04.023,0:33:05.608
>> So I watch it.

0:33:05.650,0:33:08.236
And there's-- only out of
the whole hour and a half

0:33:08.236,0:33:10.154
documentary, it's like
a five-minute clip.

0:33:10.154,0:33:13.366
And out of that, they
talk about the Law of One,

0:33:13.366,0:33:16.786
which was an ET
contact channeling

0:33:16.828,0:33:19.455
from the '80s, the "Law
of One, Ra Material."

0:33:19.497,0:33:20.289
>> OK.

0:33:20.289,0:33:22.125
>> Carla Rueckert and the crew.

0:33:22.125,0:33:25.670
And during that time,
they mentioned that.

0:33:25.670,0:33:28.756
And I'm sitting
there in excitement,

0:33:28.798,0:33:31.259
but not really
knowing anything more

0:33:31.300,0:33:33.261
about what I should
be listening for.

0:33:33.302,0:33:37.390
And right at the end of it, this
guy says: This, in my opinion,

0:33:37.390,0:33:39.851
is the greatest
channeling out there,

0:33:39.892,0:33:43.855
second only to Jane Roberts
and the "Seth Material."

0:33:43.855,0:33:44.772
One sentence.

0:33:44.814,0:33:46.858
That sentence grabbed me
more than the other five

0:33:46.858,0:33:47.859
minutes of talking.

0:33:47.859,0:33:49.527
>> Right.
>> So that's what I checked out.

0:33:49.569,0:33:51.571
And now looking
back, I know why,

0:33:51.571,0:33:54.949
because the "Ra Material"
was pretty far out there

0:33:54.949,0:33:58.036
comparatively. The "Seth
Material" was more mainstream.

0:33:58.036,0:34:00.163
It was more about
consciousness and evolution

0:34:00.204,0:34:03.082
of the soul, which was what
TReb had talked to me about.

0:34:03.124,0:34:04.292
So I locked into that.

0:34:04.292,0:34:06.836
I looked it up, got
all the audio clips,

0:34:06.878,0:34:08.463
downloaded the PDF.

0:34:08.463,0:34:09.922
All of these things online.

0:34:10.006,0:34:11.799
>> From "Seth" and "Ra,"
or just the "Seth?"

0:34:11.841,0:34:12.884
>> Just the "Seth."

0:34:12.884,0:34:15.928
The "Ra Material" was still
out of my scope, off my radar.

0:34:15.970,0:34:18.681
>> Even though you've
seen a big purple-eyed--

0:34:18.681,0:34:19.474
>> Yes.

0:34:19.515,0:34:23.811
You would think that the
rest would be OK, right?

0:34:23.811,0:34:25.354
And I never looked
at it that way.

0:34:25.354,0:34:27.106
But I always know
there was a reason.

0:34:27.148,0:34:27.940
>> OK.

0:34:27.940,0:34:31.527
>> And when I dug in, I
found out what it was.

0:34:31.527,0:34:33.404
Seth was saying the
same thing that TReb

0:34:33.488,0:34:36.324
said, just in different terms
and different terminology.

0:34:36.324,0:34:38.159
And some of these
terms were new to me.

0:34:38.159,0:34:41.496
And I had to really
kind of focus.

0:34:41.496,0:34:43.748
Some of the words, I had no
idea what they even meant,

0:34:43.748,0:34:46.167
but I would go
through, and I studied.

0:34:46.209,0:34:48.711
And what it was,
I am not a reader.

0:34:48.711,0:34:49.504
I don't read.

0:34:49.545,0:34:51.798
I listen, like audio
books are my thing.

0:34:51.798,0:34:52.590
>> Same way.

0:34:52.590,0:34:53.925
I'm the same way.

0:34:53.966,0:34:55.134
>> It's a cognitive thing.

0:34:55.176,0:34:58.805
>> I've been audio-listening
to your book.

0:34:58.805,0:34:59.847
>> Nice.

0:34:59.889,0:35:02.308
>> I have it in the PDF format,
and I have it on my iPhone.

0:35:02.350,0:35:05.603
It's a process, but
still, I can go through it

0:35:05.603,0:35:07.188
much faster by listening to it.

0:35:07.188,0:35:08.731
>> Oh, nice.

0:35:08.773,0:35:10.274
I need a program like that too.

0:35:10.274,0:35:13.277
It's helpful, to say the least.

0:35:13.319,0:35:15.530
That's how I retain
that information.

0:35:15.613,0:35:17.406
So I find this one little clip.

0:35:17.406,0:35:21.619
It's like an hour
and 50 minutes.

0:35:21.661,0:35:23.830
And it's excerpts of
"Seth Speaks, the Eternal

0:35:23.830,0:35:24.872
Validity of the Soul."

0:35:24.914,0:35:26.707
>> It's the clip on YouTube?

0:35:26.707,0:35:29.418
>> There's one on YouTube, and
there was one downloadable one

0:35:29.460,0:35:32.421
that just had the excerpts
from this guy who enjoyed that,

0:35:32.421,0:35:33.214
he read,

0:35:33.214,0:35:35.383
and it was professionally done.

0:35:35.424,0:35:40.054
And I listened to it, and it
changed my whole perspective

0:35:40.096,0:35:41.097
on a lot of stuff.

0:35:41.097,0:35:42.723
And it was so powerful
and so resonant

0:35:42.723,0:35:45.017
with what TReb had
already said to me.

0:35:45.017,0:35:48.521
And when I heard
that, it reconfirmed

0:35:48.563,0:35:51.607
that maybe I wasn't making
this stuff up in my head.

0:35:51.649,0:35:52.567
>> Right.

0:35:52.608,0:35:55.695
>> And this is something I
never have said publicly before,

0:35:55.736,0:35:58.573
but in that four-day period
where I stayed away from

0:35:58.573,0:36:00.449
the meditation and
didn't go back to TReb,

0:36:00.449,0:36:03.161
I actually went to the
emergency room and said,

0:36:03.202,0:36:05.663
I had this experience.

0:36:05.663,0:36:07.123
I might be going crazy.

0:36:07.123,0:36:08.040
>> What did they say?

0:36:08.040,0:36:09.000
>> The doctor was cool.

0:36:09.041,0:36:12.295
He's like, you're playing around
with those binaural beats.

0:36:12.295,0:36:14.672
He goes, meditation,
sometimes you

0:36:14.714,0:36:16.424
go into a lot of
subconscious places.

0:36:16.424,0:36:18.968
He said, you probably just had
some kind of weird experience.

0:36:18.968,0:36:20.553
He said, I wouldn't worry about.

0:36:20.595,0:36:21.637
>> Oh, OK.

0:36:21.637,0:36:23.055
>> Which gave me relief.

0:36:23.139,0:36:25.474
>> But you go like open the
emergency doors, and say,

0:36:25.516,0:36:31.063
I've seen a green,
seven-foot tall, blue eyes.

0:36:31.105,0:36:32.231
It's real.

0:36:32.273,0:36:35.234
Gold boots, silver robe.

0:36:35.276,0:36:37.778
>> They would have locked me up.

0:36:37.862,0:36:39.780
>> So you didn't go in
that dramatic, that big.

0:36:39.822,0:36:41.574
>> No, very lightly.

0:36:41.574,0:36:43.451
>> You just signed
the documents--

0:36:43.492,0:36:45.494
>> What are you here for?

0:36:45.536,0:36:49.040
I had an experience I
need to talk to you about.

0:36:49.081,0:36:50.082
It was very nice though.

0:36:50.082,0:36:50.875
He was cool.

0:36:50.917,0:36:51.500
>> All right.

0:36:51.542,0:36:52.585
>> If it would have been
a different doctor--

0:36:52.585,0:36:54.921
>> He didn't give you a
shot and strap you to a bed,

0:36:54.921,0:36:56.547
and hook you up to
a bunch of machines.

0:36:56.547,0:36:58.049
>> I'm sure if I
had another doctor.

0:36:58.049,0:37:00.217
>> Yeah, if you got that
wrong doctor, you probably--

0:37:00.259,0:37:01.636
>> I would have
been there, yeah.

0:37:01.677,0:37:04.472
And it's amazing to see how
the mainstream thinks about it.

0:37:04.513,0:37:05.306
>> True.

0:37:05.306,0:37:08.434
>> But I lucked out, really.

0:37:08.476,0:37:11.395
It wasn't luck, but
you know what I mean.

0:37:11.395,0:37:12.897
I get done with that.

0:37:12.897,0:37:15.024
And I have those experiences.

0:37:15.066,0:37:16.692
And from there, it
just kept going.

0:37:16.692,0:37:22.949
Now, most people who have heard
TReb or Aridif on the radio

0:37:22.949,0:37:26.994
or on YouTube, they might not
know the whole story about it.

0:37:27.078,0:37:29.872
I worked with TReb for two
years in meditative state

0:37:29.872,0:37:31.248
before I ever channeled.

0:37:31.248,0:37:33.876
I really had no
interest to channel.

0:37:33.918,0:37:35.836
At the end of the two
years, I felt like I

0:37:35.836,0:37:37.421
had learned all I could learn.

0:37:37.421,0:37:40.675
Of course, being the
human ego, I was like,

0:37:40.675,0:37:41.717
I know everything now.

0:37:41.759,0:37:42.677
>> I know the universe.

0:37:42.718,0:37:43.511
>> Yeah.

0:37:43.594,0:37:45.846
>> It's like Keanu
Reeves in the Matrix.

0:37:45.846,0:37:46.889
He's like, I know Kung Fu.

0:37:46.931,0:37:47.723
>> Yeah.

0:37:47.723,0:37:48.516
Instantly.

0:37:48.516,0:37:49.850
Yeah, that was beautiful.

0:37:49.892,0:37:54.063
>> But so after two years,
though, you're like, yeah.

0:37:54.105,0:37:55.481
>> I know what I can know.

0:37:55.523,0:37:57.900
And I wanted to find out
how to teach it to people.

0:37:57.942,0:37:58.734
>> Right.

0:37:58.734,0:38:01.195
>> I thought I was ready
to teach people, and I was.

0:38:01.195,0:38:05.491
So I knew that it was
possible to channel.

0:38:05.491,0:38:07.618
I'd seen Jane Roberts do it.

0:38:07.660,0:38:10.746
And by that point, I had
looked up Darryl Anka.

0:38:10.746,0:38:12.540
I had heard of Kryon,
even though I never

0:38:12.581,0:38:16.043
checked out a lot of
that work at that point.

0:38:16.043,0:38:18.045
And I'd seen just
a very few others.

0:38:18.045,0:38:20.256
Back when I started doing this--

0:38:20.297,0:38:22.008
>> Esther Hicks
and Abraham Hicks.

0:38:22.008,0:38:24.427
>> I'd never even heard
of her until I met Kalina.

0:38:24.468,0:38:26.887
Kalina is the one who's like,
have you ever heard of-- who?

0:38:26.929,0:38:29.056
And she's like you
really are a channeler.

0:38:29.056,0:38:30.516
Because so many
channelers are so

0:38:30.516,0:38:32.643
oblivious of other
spiritual teachers,

0:38:32.643,0:38:34.311
just because they're
in their own groove.

0:38:34.395,0:38:36.230
>> I just did another interview.

0:38:36.272,0:38:38.691
And they-- she was saying
the exact same thing.

0:38:38.691,0:38:40.318
I was like bringing
up all these names.

0:38:40.318,0:38:41.777
She was like, ah, I don't know.

0:38:41.777,0:38:44.196
The name sounds
familiar, but purposely,

0:38:44.238,0:38:46.115
I don't go and see
that stuff, because I

0:38:46.115,0:38:49.285
don't want to plagiarize
or say anything that--

0:38:49.285,0:38:51.037
I don't want anybody
to think that I'm

0:38:51.078,0:38:52.455
copying their material.

0:38:52.538,0:38:54.749
>> Well, that was a
concern of mine, too.

0:38:54.749,0:38:56.667
When I started to
jump ahead a little,

0:38:56.709,0:38:59.211
when I started channeling,
I cut myself off

0:38:59.211,0:39:01.130
from all other channel material.

0:39:01.172,0:39:02.173
I said, I want--

0:39:02.173,0:39:04.133
and this was for me,
not for anyone else--

0:39:04.175,0:39:06.802
I want to know what's coming
through is legitimate.

0:39:06.802,0:39:10.056
I had huge filter
issues in the beginning.

0:39:10.056,0:39:11.974
But to jump back,
I work with TReb.

0:39:12.016,0:39:13.267
I told him, I want to channel.

0:39:13.267,0:39:14.351
I want to share this.

0:39:14.351,0:39:16.645
But I want you to be
there for the answers,

0:39:16.687,0:39:21.025
because there's still stuff
I'm probably not sure of.

0:39:21.067,0:39:23.569
And if there is, you
need to be there.

0:39:23.569,0:39:26.572
The channeling idea was cool
to me, and we worked with it.

0:39:26.614,0:39:30.242
>> So when you said you want--

0:39:30.242,0:39:34.371
you asked him to be there, but
in essence, channeling, you're

0:39:34.371,0:39:35.581
asking him to come through.

0:39:35.623,0:39:36.165
>> Yeah.

0:39:36.165,0:39:36.957
>> OK.

0:39:36.999,0:39:39.877
You had that conversation with
him in this meditative state,

0:39:39.877,0:39:43.756
which again, I'm assuming
is still as visceral as ever.

0:39:43.756,0:39:44.548
>> Yes.

0:39:44.548,0:39:45.341
>> It's still like--

0:39:45.382,0:39:47.218
>> Never a time was dull.

0:39:47.218,0:39:48.385
>> OK.

0:39:48.385,0:39:52.223
So it all felt just like we're
having a conversation just now.

0:39:52.264,0:39:53.974
Only you're on a
ship always, or--

0:39:54.016,0:39:54.809
>> No.

0:39:54.850,0:39:56.268
We were everywhere
at that point.

0:39:56.268,0:39:57.436
The first time was a ship.

0:39:57.436,0:40:01.398
And after that, most, like
I'd say probably 75% or more

0:40:01.398,0:40:03.067
of the time, I'm with
him on his planet,

0:40:03.067,0:40:04.985
just different
parts of the planet.

0:40:04.985,0:40:07.738
But yeah, I've been
everywhere with him.

0:40:07.780,0:40:10.449
>> Well, I know I don't want
to get out of order here,

0:40:10.449,0:40:11.826
but what's his planet like?

0:40:11.867,0:40:12.243
What is that like?

0:40:12.243,0:40:13.160
>> Oh, it's beautiful.

0:40:13.160,0:40:14.245
It's gorgeous.

0:40:14.245,0:40:16.372
When you're looking
up at the sky,

0:40:16.372,0:40:18.165
it's a beautiful,
beautiful purple sky.

0:40:18.207,0:40:18.999
>> Purple sky?

0:40:18.999,0:40:21.669
>> It's hard to explain, too,
because the shade of purple it

0:40:21.710,0:40:24.296
is, there really isn't a shade
of purple I found to show

0:40:24.338,0:40:26.841
people, like this is the purple.

0:40:26.841,0:40:28.342
But they have tons
of red plants.

0:40:28.342,0:40:29.135
>> Red plants?

0:40:29.135,0:40:30.594
>> Very beautiful green water.

0:40:30.594,0:40:31.387
It's gorgeous.

0:40:31.387,0:40:32.096
>> Green water?

0:40:32.138,0:40:32.680
>> Yeah.

0:40:32.721,0:40:33.514
OK.

0:40:33.514,0:40:35.015
So we're talking.

0:40:35.057,0:40:36.225
Are all the plants red?

0:40:36.267,0:40:37.935
Do they have green plants?

0:40:37.977,0:40:38.811
>> Oh, no, no.

0:40:38.811,0:40:40.604
It's all red, just
different shades of red.

0:40:40.604,0:40:42.565
There are a couple ones
that are different,

0:40:42.606,0:40:44.984
like so different in red,
they're almost not red,

0:40:44.984,0:40:46.318
like yellows.

0:40:46.360,0:40:49.280
And a couple of them
are purple, but not--

0:40:49.280,0:40:50.406
it's like a red-purple.

0:40:50.447,0:40:51.365
It's all shaded red.

0:40:51.365,0:40:53.451
And I don't know if that
has to do with their star,

0:40:53.451,0:40:55.452
or if it has to do
with the actual plants

0:40:55.452,0:40:56.495
the way I can perceive it.

0:40:56.537,0:40:58.330
>> What about their
dirt and the ground?

0:40:58.372,0:40:59.165
What is that like?

0:40:59.206,0:41:00.166
>> I've never seen it.

0:41:00.166,0:41:01.375
It's all covered with stuff.

0:41:01.375,0:41:03.419
>> It's covered with red leaves.

0:41:03.502,0:41:04.295
>> Yeah.

0:41:04.295,0:41:05.754
Well, just like grass.

0:41:05.796,0:41:07.214
There's a different
kind of grass.

0:41:07.214,0:41:08.591
It's more fluffy.

0:41:08.591,0:41:09.800
It's like--

0:41:09.842,0:41:11.385
>> Moss?

0:41:11.385,0:41:13.762
>> Not like moss, more--

0:41:13.804,0:41:16.098
it's-- I can't think
of the plant's name.

0:41:16.098,0:41:19.268
It's stuff that people eat.

0:41:19.310,0:41:23.647
It's like a mix of kale
and a dandelion, I think.

0:41:23.647,0:41:25.357
It's hard to explain.

0:41:25.357,0:41:26.358
>> Kale and a dandelion.

0:41:26.358,0:41:28.360
>> It's fluffy, and it's leafy.

0:41:28.360,0:41:29.153
>> Not wheatgrass.

0:41:29.195,0:41:30.112
>> It might be.

0:41:30.112,0:41:31.822
I'm not versed on the--

0:41:31.864,0:41:34.074
>> On the whole
health food stuff.

0:41:34.074,0:41:34.867
>> Yes.

0:41:34.867,0:41:35.659
Not yet.

0:41:35.659,0:41:36.660
I'm working on that.

0:41:36.660,0:41:37.453
>> All right.

0:41:37.494,0:41:38.287
Interesting.

0:41:38.287,0:41:39.747
>> But it's all over the ground.

0:41:39.747,0:41:41.999
So you don't see exposed ground.

0:41:42.041,0:41:43.209
And I never went digging.

0:41:43.209,0:41:44.168
Every time I'm there--

0:41:44.210,0:41:45.377
>> Sprouts.

0:41:45.419,0:41:46.503
>> Yeah, sprouts.

0:41:46.503,0:41:47.296
That's a good one.

0:41:47.296,0:41:47.838
Yeah.

0:41:47.880,0:41:48.422
I like that.

0:41:48.464,0:41:49.381
It's kind of like that.

0:41:49.423,0:41:50.925
Yeah, but leafy,
a little leafier.

0:41:50.925,0:41:51.967
>> All right.
OK.

0:41:51.967,0:41:53.302
>> Yeah.

0:41:53.344,0:41:54.720
>> Wow.

0:41:54.720,0:41:56.222
It's fascinating,
because I've never

0:41:56.222,0:42:01.185
heard like this, like
you were in that world,

0:42:01.227,0:42:05.397
so visceral, and so real.

0:42:05.397,0:42:07.399
I didn't understand that's--

0:42:07.399,0:42:10.069
I think before we were joking
at the seminar you went fishing

0:42:10.069,0:42:10.861
with TReb.

0:42:10.861,0:42:13.822
But I'd never thought it
was actually going fishing,

0:42:13.864,0:42:14.907
like we're here at a lake.

0:42:14.949,0:42:15.449
>> Yeah.

0:42:15.449,0:42:16.992
>> It's that real
that you could go--

0:42:16.992,0:42:18.619
>> That real.

0:42:18.661,0:42:19.912
>> I wonder what kind of fish?

0:42:19.912,0:42:20.996
Did you ever see any fish?

0:42:20.996,0:42:21.789
>> No.

0:42:21.830,0:42:23.541
They do have
underwater life there.

0:42:23.541,0:42:26.210
They have big, big lizards too.

0:42:26.252,0:42:28.128
Go figure.

0:42:28.170,0:42:30.422
There are these gigantic--

0:42:30.422,0:42:32.258
I'd say probably
about six-foot long.

0:42:32.258,0:42:34.343
>> Like iguanas?

0:42:34.426,0:42:36.679
>> They're more-- they're
actually very similar,

0:42:36.720,0:42:39.723
TReb said, to their third
den-- or the second density,

0:42:39.723,0:42:43.310
their second density life,
which is, they kind of look like

0:42:43.310,0:42:46.105
Komodo dragons,
but more upright.

0:42:46.146,0:42:48.691
They're really long, really
big, very thick scaling.

0:42:48.732,0:42:51.735
They have the same color
skin as TReb's race,

0:42:51.777,0:42:53.445
different shades darker though.

0:42:53.445,0:42:55.072
More towards like a
forest green-blue,

0:42:55.072,0:42:56.115
if that makes sense.

0:42:56.156,0:42:57.157
>> And you've seen these?

0:42:57.157,0:42:57.491
>> Yeah.

0:42:57.491,0:42:58.659
I've seen those.

0:42:58.659,0:43:02.162
Those are-- the major life
on their planet are those.

0:43:02.204,0:43:03.205
>> Birds at all?

0:43:03.247,0:43:04.665
>> Yeah, they've
got flying things.

0:43:04.707,0:43:06.834
They've got little
flying things that--

0:43:06.834,0:43:08.252
they don't look
like birds, though.

0:43:08.294,0:43:09.920
They look almost like--

0:43:09.962,0:43:10.838
>> Dinosaurish?

0:43:10.838,0:43:11.630
Pterodactyls?

0:43:11.630,0:43:13.799
>> No, they're actually
very mammal-looking.

0:43:13.841,0:43:15.050
>> Oh, mammal-looking?

0:43:15.050,0:43:15.843
>> Yeah.

0:43:15.843,0:43:17.094
They're the only things on the--

0:43:17.094,0:43:17.511
>> Bats?

0:43:17.511,0:43:18.929
>> Not like a bat, either.

0:43:18.971,0:43:20.139
They have wings.

0:43:20.139,0:43:22.725
They fly, but they're real boxy.

0:43:22.766,0:43:23.559
>> Boxy.

0:43:23.559,0:43:24.393
What do you mean by boxy?

0:43:24.393,0:43:25.185
>> Squared.

0:43:25.227,0:43:27.479
They're very squared
in their features.

0:43:27.521,0:43:28.314
>> Interesting.

0:43:28.355,0:43:29.106
>> Yeah.
>> Wow.

0:43:29.106,0:43:29.773
>> It's different.

0:43:29.815,0:43:30.524
>> This is fascinating.

0:43:30.524,0:43:32.276
I feel like we don't
even need to channel.

0:43:32.276,0:43:35.779
We can just talk all
day about this world.

0:43:35.821,0:43:38.824
>> There's been some worlds
that I've seen too before.

0:43:38.824,0:43:42.328
I have talked to people,
like CGI artists, and said,

0:43:42.369,0:43:44.496
I want to describe this
to you and make it,

0:43:44.496,0:43:45.748
but it's such a process.

0:43:45.748,0:43:47.750
And nobody has an
interest in doing it,

0:43:47.791,0:43:51.295
unless there's money
involved with it.

0:43:51.337,0:43:53.797
The few people who've
done artwork for us

0:43:53.797,0:43:57.593
usually do the entities that I
channel, like TReb or Aridif.

0:43:57.593,0:43:59.887
Vashta does those, and Eduardo.

0:44:00.512,0:44:03.807
>> Do you think then
when CGI artists--

0:44:03.807,0:44:05.601
I used to run a visual
effects company,

0:44:05.643,0:44:08.854
so I know some of these
model makers come out

0:44:08.854,0:44:10.481
with these fascinating designs--

0:44:10.522,0:44:12.066
do you think they're
actually tapping

0:44:12.066,0:44:16.111
into some alternate planetary
consciousness out there

0:44:16.111,0:44:18.906
as opposed to it being
originally created,

0:44:18.947,0:44:24.119
or maybe pieces of different
planetary consciousnesses?

0:44:24.203,0:44:27.039
>> I guarantee they're
channeling 90% or more of it.

0:44:27.039,0:44:28.415
>> Oh, wow.

0:44:28.457,0:44:32.461
>> They're even-- and it's
something like it's a conundrum

0:44:32.503,0:44:35.589
where is it that
everything exists,

0:44:35.631,0:44:37.508
or is it that this
universe is so big,

0:44:37.508,0:44:39.343
that it has to exist somewhere?

0:44:39.385,0:44:42.221
Or is it just whatever
you think, you create?

0:44:42.221,0:44:44.390
It doesn't really matter,
because what they're doing

0:44:44.390,0:44:45.182
is real.

0:44:45.182,0:44:47.226
I've seen some of the
special effects stuff

0:44:47.226,0:44:49.144
that people have done in
movies or video games.

0:44:49.186,0:44:50.604
And it's like,
I've seen something

0:44:50.604,0:44:53.607
almost exactly like that,
or something very similar.

0:44:53.649,0:44:56.110
Enough where you couldn't
notice the difference to someone

0:44:56.151,0:44:57.444
who doesn't live there.

0:44:57.444,0:44:58.445
>> Right.
Wow.

0:44:58.445,0:45:00.531
>> So it's truly inspiration.

0:45:00.572,0:45:03.492
That imagination part of
us is us tapping into that.

0:45:03.492,0:45:04.284
>> Yeah.

0:45:04.326,0:45:05.744
Fascinating.

0:45:05.828,0:45:09.540
So you spend two years
going to this world,

0:45:09.540,0:45:11.458
having these conversations.

0:45:11.458,0:45:15.838
And it's your idea then
to finally talk to TReb

0:45:15.879,0:45:18.465
and say, hey, why don't we try
this whole channeling thing?

0:45:18.507,0:45:19.007
>> Yeah.

0:45:19.007,0:45:19.758
>> And what does he say?

0:45:19.758,0:45:20.717
Of course, I'm sure.

0:45:20.717,0:45:21.093
>> Yeah.

0:45:21.093,0:45:22.136
He said, yeah.

0:45:22.177,0:45:24.680
That's one of the
paths we can take.

0:45:24.680,0:45:26.724
>> Awesome.

0:45:26.765,0:45:30.269
And did he give you
tips on how to do it?

0:45:30.310,0:45:33.647
Or were you, by this time,
versed enough to say,

0:45:33.647,0:45:35.274
OK, this is what
we've got to do, TReb.

0:45:35.274,0:45:36.108
How did that work?

0:45:36.108,0:45:39.445
>> No, it's actually a
combination of the two.

0:45:39.445,0:45:43.574
And it was never me going,
hey, I think this will work.

0:45:43.574,0:45:44.742
I went out on the internet.

0:45:44.783,0:45:46.452
Obviously, the
internet was great.

0:45:46.452,0:45:47.953
There wasn't a lot
of stuff there.

0:45:47.953,0:45:51.165
So I searched out
psychic mediums.

0:45:51.206,0:45:55.252
I knew a guy who worked with
the team of the "Law of One"

0:45:55.294,0:45:59.173
material, that after the "Law
Of One" material was written,

0:45:59.214,0:46:01.717
he worked closely with
the main channeler there,

0:46:01.717,0:46:02.968
Carla Rueckert.

0:46:02.968,0:46:04.762
So I worked with him
and talked to him.

0:46:04.803,0:46:08.140
And he gave me a lot of
really great information.

0:46:08.182,0:46:10.601
I had looked up online a
couple of channeling books.

0:46:10.601,0:46:12.644
And now I realize,
probably, some

0:46:12.644,0:46:15.439
of the same people
that I'm aware of today

0:46:15.481,0:46:17.232
and just didn't know
was them back then.

0:46:17.232,0:46:18.025
>> Right.

0:46:18.025,0:46:19.026
>> And worked with TReb.

0:46:19.067,0:46:20.777
And TReb helped
me out with a lot.

0:46:20.777,0:46:23.989
And then I just kind of borrowed
a little from everything

0:46:24.031,0:46:25.365
until it was perfect.

0:46:25.407,0:46:27.201
And then I found my own mix.

0:46:27.201,0:46:30.788
It was a garden variety of
a little bit of everything.

0:46:30.788,0:46:31.789
>> What got you through?

0:46:31.789,0:46:34.166
What was the catalyst
to bring TReb through?

0:46:34.208,0:46:36.418
What was your first channeling
experience, I guess?

0:46:36.502,0:46:41.465
>> Well, my first channeling
experience, I set up a camera.

0:46:41.465,0:46:45.594
My then wife was there to
kind of monitor me and make

0:46:45.636,0:46:47.596
sure nothing went too crazy.

0:46:47.596,0:46:49.306
That was a concern of mine.

0:46:49.306,0:46:51.350
I got this entity
coming in my body.

0:46:51.391,0:46:54.686
I don't want to
lose control or--

0:46:54.686,0:46:56.522
you know, the Christian
part of my mind...

0:46:56.605,0:46:58.440
>> Hulk out!

0:46:58.440,0:47:00.859
You have this big green
alien coming through you,

0:47:00.859,0:47:04.905
you might. Did that
ever go through you mind?

0:47:04.947,0:47:06.281
>> A little bit of that.

0:47:06.323,0:47:07.115
>> OK.

0:47:07.157,0:47:08.784
>> At that point,
I trusted TReb.

0:47:08.826,0:47:11.995
I'd come to love him
like a dear friend.

0:47:11.995,0:47:13.956
But there's still the unknown.

0:47:13.997,0:47:17.668
Why would this entity come and
choose me out of everybody?

0:47:17.668,0:47:19.253
Why?

0:47:19.294,0:47:21.964
My Christian beliefs tapped
on my shoulder a few times.

0:47:21.964,0:47:23.590
So I wanted to be careful.

0:47:23.632,0:47:24.550
I wanted to be good.

0:47:24.550,0:47:28.595
I recorded myself, and it
was amazingly horrible.

0:47:28.637,0:47:29.888
>> Amazingly horrible.

0:47:29.888,0:47:31.139
>> Yes.

0:47:31.181,0:47:31.974
>> OK.

0:47:31.974,0:47:33.475
Can you describe
amazingly horrible?

0:47:33.475,0:47:34.560
>> Yes.

0:47:34.560,0:47:36.478
The voice that
people hear TReb now,

0:47:36.520,0:47:40.023
even if they go back four
years, it's not the same.

0:47:40.065,0:47:41.233
It's a little different.

0:47:41.233,0:47:48.532
And the accent's the same, the
type of talking that he uses.

0:47:48.574,0:47:50.576
But the inflections
are different.

0:47:50.576,0:47:52.661
And the yeses are
much more vibrant.

0:47:52.661,0:47:55.581
And like when he says,
yes-- that "ye-e-e-s",

0:47:55.581,0:47:57.249
really excited-- that
wasn't there then.

0:47:57.291,0:48:02.713
It was very flat and monotone,
and kind of filtery too.

0:48:02.713,0:48:03.880
There was just--

0:48:03.880,0:48:06.216
I could tell all of
TReb wasn't getting in.

0:48:06.216,0:48:09.303
So I practiced a few more times.

0:48:09.303,0:48:12.347
But when you get to know
me, you know about me,

0:48:12.389,0:48:13.765
I don't wait for anything.

0:48:13.807,0:48:15.434
I don't wait till
everything's perfect.

0:48:15.434,0:48:19.104
I just jump headfirst, fly
by the seat of my pants.

0:48:19.146,0:48:22.399
So I immediately went
to the YouTube waves.

0:48:22.441,0:48:23.984
I want to share this.

0:48:23.984,0:48:27.988
And my first channeling
was actually a lot better.

0:48:28.030,0:48:30.073
In the couple of times I
had tried between then,

0:48:30.073,0:48:32.826
I probably only did
maybe 6 to 10 channelings

0:48:32.868,0:48:36.288
between the first one and
the one I put on YouTube.

0:48:36.330,0:48:41.668
>> And when you describe
6 to 10 channelings,

0:48:41.668,0:48:44.087
or six channelings
or so before you--

0:48:44.087,0:48:47.174
and you're recording yourself,
are you asking questions?

0:48:47.215,0:48:48.342
Is it just you in the room?

0:48:48.342,0:48:50.010
I mean, how do you--

0:48:50.010,0:48:51.553
is there somebody else?

0:48:51.553,0:48:54.181
Well, you said your wife-- is
she there to help facilitate?

0:48:54.222,0:48:55.223
>> Yes.

0:48:55.265,0:48:57.517
At that point, the
first couple ones

0:48:57.517,0:48:59.978
was just letting TReb talk.

0:48:59.978,0:49:01.647
I told him, you
just come through

0:49:01.688,0:49:03.190
and say what you want to say.

0:49:03.190,0:49:04.441
I'll share something.

0:49:04.441,0:49:06.360
If it's usable, we
can put it on YouTube.

0:49:06.401,0:49:07.736
So address people.

0:49:07.736,0:49:09.279
And that's the first
couple of times.

0:49:09.279,0:49:14.284
And then after that, my then
wife would ask a few questions.

0:49:14.284,0:49:16.203
I let one of my friends try.

0:49:16.244,0:49:18.288
So it was basically trial
and error, just playing

0:49:18.288,0:49:20.874
around the first time.

0:49:20.958,0:49:28.715
>> So I guess the
information was still good.

0:49:28.715,0:49:30.926
It was just-- you say
when it was horrible,

0:49:30.967,0:49:32.594
it wasn't the
information was horrible.

0:49:32.594,0:49:33.387
>> Right.

0:49:33.428,0:49:34.346
>> OK.

0:49:34.346,0:49:37.641
>> And some of the information
came through a little odd,

0:49:37.683,0:49:40.978
just the verbiage
on it was weird.

0:49:41.019,0:49:43.772
You could tell it
was like having

0:49:43.772,0:49:46.733
someone who first learned how to
speak English be able to talk.

0:49:46.775,0:49:47.567
>> Right.

0:49:47.567,0:49:48.360
OK.

0:49:48.402,0:49:50.779
Well, that's what
I was wondering.

0:49:50.779,0:49:52.989
And maybe this is a
question for TReb later.

0:49:52.989,0:49:54.241
Does he have to learn English?

0:49:54.241,0:49:59.788
Or is it all translated by you
via vibrational translations,

0:49:59.871,0:50:01.331
vibrational frequencies?

0:50:01.331,0:50:05.085
>> My best understanding
is that, basically--

0:50:05.085,0:50:08.588
like when I go to channel,
I'm using the same techniques

0:50:08.588,0:50:10.590
in a quicker way
than I used to when

0:50:10.632,0:50:12.926
I would leave my physical body.

0:50:12.926,0:50:15.303
So I'm leaving, and
part of TReb comes in.

0:50:15.345,0:50:18.140
So when he's in, he's
mixing his energy with mine.

0:50:18.140,0:50:21.059
So it's running through
my chakra systems,

0:50:21.101,0:50:23.562
but also accessing
the brain part.

0:50:23.603,0:50:26.481
And in that brain part is
the whole English language,

0:50:26.523,0:50:30.027
my experiences, all
of my personality.

0:50:30.027,0:50:32.279
So he has the opportunity
to access that.

0:50:32.279,0:50:35.574
So English, it wasn't
that the English was bad,

0:50:35.574,0:50:37.826
because he knew English
by knowing my mind.

0:50:37.826,0:50:39.911
It was the way of
trying to express it.

0:50:39.953,0:50:42.289
Like Aridif and TReb,
still to this day,

0:50:42.289,0:50:44.875
sometimes they might get hung
up on a word, so they'll stop.

0:50:44.875,0:50:45.667
>> Right.

0:50:45.709,0:50:48.211
>> And they'll search
for the word or find one

0:50:48.253,0:50:50.047
that's as compatible
as they can.

0:50:50.047,0:50:55.510
So sometimes when-- like the one
that's most known, Aridif, when

0:50:55.510,0:50:57.888
he says, you must do
this, he's not saying,

0:50:57.888,0:50:59.222
you have to do this.

0:50:59.264,0:51:01.850
He's saying, if you want
what you're desiring,

0:51:01.850,0:51:02.726
this is the best way.

0:51:02.726,0:51:03.518
>> Right

0:51:03.560,0:51:04.811
>> So little things like that.

0:51:04.811,0:51:09.232
But then it was much more
disproportional than it is now.

0:51:09.232,0:51:10.025
>> I see.

0:51:10.025,0:51:12.444
So it was more of a
translation glitch--

0:51:12.527,0:51:13.278
>> Right.

0:51:13.278,0:51:17.282
>> Than an actual understanding
of the language or knowing

0:51:17.324,0:51:18.116
the language.

0:51:18.116,0:51:20.118
It's not necessarily
what's happening.

0:51:20.160,0:51:24.206
It's not like he went and had
to take a course in English 101.

0:51:24.206,0:51:25.957
>> That would be rough.

0:51:25.999,0:51:26.792
Yeah.

0:51:26.833,0:51:28.627
But yeah, absolutely.

0:51:28.668,0:51:33.298
It's a translational
vibrational thing.

0:51:33.340,0:51:37.928
My vibration at the time,
it wasn't what it is now.

0:51:37.928,0:51:39.513
I was learning all
this cool stuff,

0:51:39.554,0:51:41.765
but I hadn't applied
very much of it.

0:51:41.765,0:51:44.434
What I did learn
and applied helped.

0:51:44.476,0:51:47.020
And it was really six months--

0:51:47.062,0:51:48.688
>> In some way, you're
translating too.

0:51:48.730,0:51:50.440
You have to raise your level.

0:51:50.440,0:51:52.234
He has to bring his level down.

0:51:52.234,0:51:55.237
So there has to
be this kind of--

0:51:55.237,0:51:57.989
and then there's a growth,
I'm assuming, since then.

0:51:57.989,0:51:59.699
Like you said,
it's gotten better.

0:51:59.741,0:52:04.162
So you're able to meet
each other's frequencies.

0:52:04.162,0:52:05.080
You're going up there,

0:52:05.080,0:52:06.957
him coming down here.

0:52:06.998,0:52:09.000
So that's evolved
over the years.

0:52:09.084,0:52:10.126
>> Yes, absolutely.

0:52:10.126,0:52:12.504
That's the perfect way,
too, to explain that.

0:52:12.504,0:52:16.591
It's something where
it's amalgamation

0:52:16.591,0:52:18.385
of two consciousnesses.

0:52:18.426,0:52:20.428
And it's a concerted
effort on both

0:52:20.470,0:52:22.389
of our parts to co-create that.

0:52:22.389,0:52:23.598
And I couldn't get up to him.

0:52:23.640,0:52:25.433
He could always come
down to me, but I just

0:52:25.433,0:52:26.351
couldn't get up to him.

0:52:26.393,0:52:30.188
And the more I channeled,
the more I felt his energy.

0:52:30.230,0:52:31.982
And the more I felt
his energy, the easier

0:52:31.982,0:52:35.944
it was for me to integrate
certain parts of the teachings.

0:52:35.986,0:52:40.490
And in the teachings, a lot of
the stuff about self-creation,

0:52:40.490,0:52:43.493
relaxing, the way
to perceive reality

0:52:43.535,0:52:45.120
started clicking easier.

0:52:45.161,0:52:47.956
So after the first six
months of channeling,

0:52:47.998,0:52:50.000
I was 10 times better
than the first one.

0:52:50.041,0:52:51.543
And in the first
year of channeling,

0:52:51.543,0:52:53.295
I was 10 times better than that.

0:52:53.295,0:52:54.379
And it kept going.

0:52:54.421,0:52:57.632
And it's like any
job that any person

0:52:57.632,0:53:00.135
does with their motor skills.

0:53:00.135,0:53:01.928
Muscle memory comes into play.

0:53:01.970,0:53:03.972
Well, this is energetic
muscle memory.

0:53:04.014,0:53:05.390
And that's how it's applied.

0:53:05.390,0:53:09.227
It's the more you do and repeat,
the better you are at it.

0:53:09.269,0:53:11.855
And that's why even to this
day, I get better at channeling.

0:53:11.855,0:53:12.647
>> I see.

0:53:12.647,0:53:16.067
>> This time last year,
channeling was great.

0:53:16.109,0:53:17.110
It was smooth.

0:53:17.110,0:53:20.238
People resonated with it, but
now it's a whole new level.

0:53:20.238,0:53:22.240
And this is why you
see the veterans

0:53:22.282,0:53:24.534
out there who've channeled
their entire life;

0:53:24.576,0:53:26.870
Darryl Anka, and
Nora, and Wendy.

0:53:26.870,0:53:28.955
All those great
channelers, they've

0:53:28.955,0:53:29.956
been doing that forever.

0:53:29.998,0:53:31.833
It's their connection.

0:53:31.875,0:53:33.668
TReb and Aridif actually
have a term for it.

0:53:33.710,0:53:35.545
It's called building a bridge.

0:53:35.587,0:53:37.213
And each time you
channel, you're

0:53:37.213,0:53:40.967
putting a new peg in, or a new
screw, or a new plate of metal.

0:53:40.967,0:53:42.469
And the bigger the
piece comes, it's

0:53:42.469,0:53:45.263
the bigger realizations
you have in yourself.

0:53:45.305,0:53:48.224
I had points in my channeling
where I didn't learn anything.

0:53:48.308,0:53:51.228
Whenever I'd listen back
to a session, I was like,

0:53:51.228,0:53:53.146
I already knew that.

0:53:53.146,0:53:56.441
But when I started
really learning things

0:53:56.483,0:53:58.068
about my own life
on my own terms,

0:53:58.068,0:53:59.945
then it would shine
through on the channeling.

0:53:59.945,0:54:03.198
And then it would open
up more synchronicities.

0:54:03.239,0:54:05.492
And it wasn't that the
information wasn't new.

0:54:05.492,0:54:07.827
It's just the way I
perceived it was old.

0:54:07.869,0:54:11.665
So when I changed my
perceptions and my energy grew,

0:54:11.665,0:54:14.125
that allowed that energy
to come in a lot better

0:54:14.125,0:54:16.795
with understandings
and synchronicities

0:54:16.836,0:54:18.088
to apply itself.

0:54:18.129,0:54:21.049
>> So would that make the
channeling then better, better,

0:54:21.091,0:54:23.510
more defined, or in a better--

0:54:27.013,0:54:27.889
more terminology?

0:54:27.889,0:54:30.517
Or because you were able to
have that perspective on it,

0:54:30.558,0:54:32.227
did you think that
helped the channeling?

0:54:32.310,0:54:33.478
>> Absolutely.

0:54:33.478,0:54:34.854
And that was another thing.

0:54:34.854,0:54:39.109
My English skills have zero.

0:54:39.150,0:54:41.403
When I went through
school, I sucked at it.

0:54:41.403,0:54:42.904
I could speak English.

0:54:42.904,0:54:43.697
>> Just like me.

0:54:43.697,0:54:44.489
>> Yeah.

0:54:44.531,0:54:46.950
And it's not something
that I was great at.

0:54:46.950,0:54:47.742
>> Right.

0:54:47.742,0:54:50.745
>> But the more I cared
about how I talked,

0:54:50.787,0:54:52.664
because I realized--

0:54:52.664,0:54:55.583
and Kalina has been my
number one helper in that.

0:54:55.583,0:54:58.420
Every time I throw a
word that doesn't exist

0:54:58.420,0:55:00.588
or one that's mispronounced,
she helps me with that,

0:55:00.588,0:55:03.800
because she knows, they need
that too to reflect back on.

0:55:03.800,0:55:04.676
>> I see.

0:55:04.718,0:55:06.136
>> But the more
energy I opened up,

0:55:06.177,0:55:08.847
the more clarity came with
it, the easier it was for them

0:55:08.847,0:55:13.101
to find the translation, not
only of energy, but words.

0:55:13.143,0:55:14.227
>> Interesting.

0:55:14.269,0:55:18.815
So TReb started coming in,

0:55:18.857,0:55:19.858
and you're checking in.

0:55:19.899,0:55:23.278
Are you still going and doing
your meditations with him

0:55:23.445,0:55:25.572
at the same time
during this process?

0:55:25.613,0:55:28.158
Or is the process of
channeling, is it the same

0:55:28.199,0:55:30.201
as going into the meditations?

0:55:30.201,0:55:33.121
Are you trance channeling,
I guess,

0:55:33.163,0:55:35.457
in a sense where --
are you conscious

0:55:35.457,0:55:37.834
of what's happening
during the channel?

0:55:37.876,0:55:39.669
>> Now, it depends.

0:55:39.711,0:55:43.965
There are three types of
channel states that I do.

0:55:44.007,0:55:46.384
All of them are
trance channeling.

0:55:46.426,0:55:48.678
The first and most
common occurrence

0:55:48.678,0:55:51.347
is just like when
I visited TReb.

0:55:51.347,0:55:52.557
I'm going to visit him.

0:55:52.599,0:55:54.392
I'm there with him astrally.

0:55:54.392,0:55:58.938
I perceive him in real-time,
just as real as we are.

0:55:58.980,0:56:00.899
And that happens the most.

0:56:00.899,0:56:03.401
And while I'm
channeling down here,

0:56:03.401,0:56:05.195
not conscious of anything
that's being said,

0:56:05.195,0:56:06.237
I'm hanging out with him.

0:56:06.237,0:56:07.697
Going fishing with TReb.

0:56:07.739,0:56:08.740
>> Right.
Right.

0:56:08.740,0:56:11.367
>> And the second level
is the same thing.

0:56:11.367,0:56:12.243
I'm out of my body.

0:56:12.285,0:56:13.828
I'm experiencing something.

0:56:13.828,0:56:16.873
But usually, it's something
that needs to be seen by me.

0:56:16.915,0:56:18.666
And this can be a lot
of different things.

0:56:18.666,0:56:20.877
TReb showed me time periods.

0:56:20.877,0:56:22.921
He showed me different
planets, different animals,

0:56:22.962,0:56:25.965
different vegetation,
just all sorts of stuff

0:56:26.007,0:56:30.595
that at a later time comes in
for referencing that I need.

0:56:30.637,0:56:33.306
So that happens very seldomly.

0:56:33.306,0:56:35.809
>> When you say, come in for
reference, in what sense?

0:56:35.850,0:56:37.519
Like the conversation
we're having here,

0:56:37.519,0:56:39.145
and you can
reference that stuff?

0:56:39.187,0:56:39.979
>> Yeah.

0:56:40.021,0:56:42.732
Like sometimes,
people are like, yeah,

0:56:42.732,0:56:45.151
I met this reptilian
being that was so and so.

0:56:45.151,0:56:46.861
And so I was like, oh,
that's the same one

0:56:46.861,0:56:48.113
that TReb showed me.

0:56:48.154,0:56:50.865
Or I wonder what happened
in this timeline.

0:56:50.865,0:56:52.283
It gives me a better
understanding.

0:56:52.325,0:56:54.869
And I don't understand
what it is in the moment,

0:56:54.869,0:56:57.914
but in reflecting later, I
always get what's going on.

0:56:57.956,0:56:58.748
>> I see.

0:56:58.748,0:57:01.000
>> So that's the second
most common occurrence.

0:57:01.000,0:57:03.670
And then the last one is where
I'm like in a deep meditative

0:57:03.711,0:57:06.464
state, where everything's
just kind of blacked out,

0:57:06.464,0:57:08.633
sometimes colors,
sometimes things like that.

0:57:08.633,0:57:11.386
And I'm able to hear what's
going on in the session.

0:57:11.427,0:57:15.640
Now, if I channel 100 times,
probably 85 to 90 of them

0:57:15.640,0:57:18.518
are me and TReb hanging out.

0:57:18.560,0:57:22.772
All of them, but one of them
would be the deep meditation

0:57:22.772,0:57:24.691
where I'm hearing the session.

0:57:24.732,0:57:26.151
And this only
occurs when there is

0:57:26.151,0:57:28.987
something I really need to hear
in that moment in the session.

0:57:28.987,0:57:30.447
So it very rarely occurs.

0:57:30.530,0:57:32.949
>> Do you ever go in and out,
like you're hanging out with

0:57:32.949,0:57:34.492
him, and all of a sudden you
get sucked back into the room?

0:57:34.492,0:57:35.743
>> No, never.

0:57:35.743,0:57:37.579
It's always with
TReb all the time,

0:57:37.620,0:57:39.956
or he's showing me
something, or then.

0:57:39.956,0:57:42.917
And the second most common
one where he's showing me

0:57:42.959,0:57:44.460
something, it's not with him.

0:57:44.502,0:57:47.505
It's me separately by
myself seeing these things.

0:57:47.505,0:57:49.674
So that rarely ever occurs.

0:57:49.716,0:57:53.219
Out of 100 times, maybe 14
times I'll be doing that.

0:57:53.219,0:57:55.388
So it's not very-- and it's
probably less than that,

0:57:55.388,0:57:59.517
but I'm trying to give a scale
for people to understand that.

0:57:59.559,0:58:02.145
>> Now, do you--

0:58:02.187,0:58:04.022
since starting the
channeling, since having

0:58:04.022,0:58:07.025
these conversations with
TReb, the meditations,

0:58:07.108,0:58:10.570
have you become more--

0:58:10.570,0:58:12.655
instead of just applying
these things to your life,

0:58:12.655,0:58:14.908
have you noticed your
own intuitiveness

0:58:14.908,0:58:20.038
or psychic abilities, or
anything else happening

0:58:20.079,0:58:22.040
in these past few years?

0:58:22.040,0:58:23.291
>> Absolutely.

0:58:23.333,0:58:24.876
The integration process.

0:58:24.876,0:58:27.921
And this is something
that's fairly new to me.

0:58:27.921,0:58:33.092
I've been doing channeling in
the sense of public channeling

0:58:33.134,0:58:37.096
since about 2010, late 2010.

0:58:37.138,0:58:40.850
And in that time,
I was always aware

0:58:40.850,0:58:42.227
that TReb's energy
was around me,

0:58:42.268,0:58:44.771
but it never went past that.

0:58:44.771,0:58:47.440
My life, my intuition
was good, but it

0:58:47.440,0:58:51.069
was no better than where I was
when I first started meditating

0:58:51.110,0:58:53.613
and learning to receive.

0:58:53.613,0:58:55.532
In the last year, year
and a half-- well,

0:58:55.573,0:58:57.283
it's probably closer
to two years now--

0:58:57.283,0:58:59.869
I've actually been more
conscious of TReb and Aridif

0:58:59.869,0:59:01.704
as they come through.

0:59:01.746,0:59:05.917
I can hear TReb give me messages
while I'm in the wakened state.

0:59:05.959,0:59:07.794
I feel more of
his consciousness.

0:59:07.794,0:59:12.799
My personality even is more
the style of TReb, where--

0:59:12.840,0:59:15.843
like TReb, he loves everything.

0:59:15.843,0:59:17.303
He wants to
experience everything.

0:59:17.345,0:59:19.639
And I find more of
that energy in me.

0:59:19.639,0:59:21.557
And there's always been
a part of that for me.

0:59:21.557,0:59:23.810
I've always enjoyed
enjoying things,

0:59:23.893,0:59:25.270
but to a different extent.

0:59:25.311,0:59:28.314
I could feel that combining
with TReb's energy.

0:59:28.314,0:59:29.649
So it's like an amalgamation.

0:59:29.691,0:59:31.401
And this goes with
psychic ability.

0:59:31.401,0:59:33.152
It goes with everything.

0:59:33.152,0:59:35.822
There's times where I grab
something and walk it over

0:59:35.822,0:59:36.614
to Kalina.

0:59:36.614,0:59:38.783
And she's like, I was just
going to ask you for that.

0:59:38.825,0:59:41.369
Or things simple like
that, like picking

0:59:41.411,0:59:42.954
a movie that she
had wanted to watch,

0:59:42.954,0:59:44.956
or a song that she
was dying to hear.

0:59:44.956,0:59:45.999
So those things.

0:59:46.040,0:59:48.543
And that shows a great deal
about both of our connection

0:59:48.585,0:59:49.377
too as well.

0:59:49.377,0:59:55.341
But meeting Kalina was probably
one of the energetic shifting

0:59:55.383,0:59:57.468
points on a lot of things.

0:59:57.510,1:00:01.222
When I met Kalina, it's just
the energy shifted so much.

1:00:01.264,1:00:03.891
I finally found a partner
who was on the same journey

1:00:03.891,1:00:05.059
that I was.

1:00:05.101,1:00:06.894
The same excitements.

1:00:06.894,1:00:08.896
She met me through
the work I was doing.

1:00:08.896,1:00:11.524
She was helping me
edit videos and stuff

1:00:11.524,1:00:13.901
as we developed a friendship
for a couple of years.

1:00:13.943,1:00:17.697
And then as my divorce
happened with my ex-wife, then

1:00:17.739,1:00:18.990
me and her got together.

1:00:18.990,1:00:21.075
And we started a relationship.

1:00:21.075,1:00:23.077
And her excitements
and my excitements,

1:00:23.119,1:00:25.830
because they're on the same
level, we reflect that.

1:00:25.872,1:00:29.125
So our psychic ability helps.

1:00:29.125,1:00:31.210
The efforts of the
work has helped.

1:00:31.252,1:00:33.755
I was just-- when I
first started channeling,

1:00:33.755,1:00:35.131
I was doing it for fun.

1:00:35.173,1:00:38.343
I was doing it for the benefit
of other people, which I still

1:00:38.384,1:00:39.177
am.

1:00:39.177,1:00:41.304
But I had a daytime job.

1:00:41.346,1:00:43.431
I worked that job
10 hours a day.

1:00:43.431,1:00:47.060
>> I was going to say, how in
the world could you meditate

1:00:47.143,1:00:50.021
for as long as you did
for the first two years,

1:00:50.021,1:00:53.024
and still maintain a
job, and have a son?

1:00:53.066,1:00:55.151
And that's crazy.

1:00:55.151,1:00:56.194
Did you sleep?

1:00:56.235,1:00:59.864
>> Well, the first hour and 25
minutes, that was pretty easy.

1:00:59.947,1:01:02.075
The first one in the
morning before all the kids.

1:01:02.075,1:01:03.868
Because I used to
babysit, so I was at home.

1:01:03.910,1:01:04.702
>> Oh, wow.

1:01:04.702,1:01:05.870
>> I could work from home.

1:01:05.870,1:01:08.539
And when these four to
six kids would come over,

1:01:08.539,1:01:10.958
I would be able to meditate
before they got there, and then

1:01:11.000,1:01:13.670
once at lunch time when
I put them all for a nap,

1:01:13.670,1:01:15.922
and once after Jeremy.

1:01:15.963,1:01:19.675
He would get home from school
after the kids would leave.

1:01:19.675,1:01:22.136
And then I would be able to
put him to bed, and then do it.

1:01:22.220,1:01:23.596
>> So you figured
it out somehow.

1:01:23.596,1:01:24.389
>> I did.

1:01:24.389,1:01:28.059
>> You managed to
get those several--

1:01:28.059,1:01:29.977
two to four hours a day?

1:01:29.977,1:01:32.522
>> Well, three of the
meditations were an hour

1:01:32.522,1:01:33.481
to an hour and 25.

1:01:33.523,1:01:36.609
My closed-eye technique didn't
require me to be anywhere.

1:01:36.651,1:01:38.069
I could still be
present with you.

1:01:38.069,1:01:39.737
Like right now, I'm
closing my eyes.

1:01:39.737,1:01:40.947
I can hear you.

1:01:40.947,1:01:42.573
I can hear Kalina, so I'm OK.

1:01:42.615,1:01:46.119
And if I didn't need my
eyes, I could literally up

1:01:46.119,1:01:49.330
to six to eight hours a day
do the closed-eye technique.

1:01:49.372,1:01:52.250
Whenever I didn't need my eyes,
they were shut all the time.

1:01:52.291,1:01:53.126
I was dedicated.

1:01:53.167,1:01:53.668
I was like--

1:01:53.668,1:01:54.252
>> Wow.

1:01:54.252,1:01:55.044
That's awesome.

1:01:55.086,1:01:55.461
>> Yeah.

1:01:55.461,1:01:55.961
I was like--

1:01:55.962,1:01:56.879
>> I'm taking notes.

1:01:56.879,1:01:58.464
>> An addict for meditation.

1:01:58.464,1:01:58.798
>> Yeah.

1:01:58.798,1:01:59.590
>> It was.

1:01:59.632,1:02:01.300
I was addicted to it.

1:02:01.342,1:02:02.802
>> Do you still meditate then?

1:02:02.802,1:02:05.304
>> The only meditation I need
now is when I connect to TReb.

1:02:05.304,1:02:08.307
I do it so frequently, that
that is my meditation now.

1:02:08.349,1:02:09.308
>> I was going to say--

1:02:09.308,1:02:10.810
because it sounds
like a meditation.

1:02:10.810,1:02:14.188
You're going to this deep--
you're going to another planet.

1:02:14.188,1:02:15.273
Jeez.

1:02:15.314,1:02:16.107
That's awesome.

1:02:16.107,1:02:20.194
>> Well, in all honesty, though,
it's something that I found

1:02:20.236,1:02:21.904
about people in their
spiritual journey.

1:02:21.904,1:02:25.950
And something that just
recently was brought up

1:02:25.992,1:02:27.493
in a conversation.

1:02:27.493,1:02:29.787
When you reach a certain
point of integrating

1:02:29.829,1:02:33.332
with these beings or integrating
with your higher self, whatever

1:02:33.374,1:02:36.210
it is, when you feel
good about your life

1:02:36.294,1:02:37.753
when you're living
that vibration,

1:02:37.753,1:02:41.090
there's not always as
much need for meditation.

1:02:41.132,1:02:44.469
So when I meditate and connect
my TReb, I'm integrating.

1:02:44.510,1:02:46.804
But during the day now,
I'm integrating, too,

1:02:46.804,1:02:51.017
because I used that meditation
to pull myself out of suffering

1:02:51.058,1:02:52.268
and pain to start with.

1:02:52.268,1:02:55.271
And then I used it
to hone my skills.

1:02:55.354,1:02:56.314
My skills are here.

1:02:56.355,1:02:57.523
They're strong.

1:02:57.523,1:02:59.233
I don't have very much
suffering anymore.

1:02:59.275,1:03:03.529
I'm still human, so a
little bit here and there.

1:03:03.529,1:03:05.531
So now there's not
as much a need.

1:03:05.531,1:03:09.619
And the time I spend with TReb,
I'm doing this now as a living.

1:03:09.660,1:03:13.164
So when I'm doing it once,
twice, three times a day,

1:03:13.164,1:03:14.749
that's my meditation.

1:03:14.791,1:03:15.791
It works.

1:03:15.791,1:03:17.668
>> Awesome, awesome, awesome.

1:03:17.752,1:03:22.006
Well, in addition to
TReb, you channel Aridif.

1:03:22.006,1:03:22.798
>> Yes.

1:03:22.840,1:03:25.176
>> And recently
I heard Metatron.

1:03:25.176,1:03:27.345
Who else do you channel?

1:03:27.386,1:03:29.388
And then maybe we can
get into a little bit

1:03:29.430,1:03:31.807
of what led up to bringing
in these other entities.

1:03:31.807,1:03:32.600
>> Sure.

1:03:32.600,1:03:34.143
>> Let's start with Aridif
before we get into anybody

1:03:34.143,1:03:34.560
else.

1:03:34.560,1:03:35.353
>> OK.

1:03:35.353,1:03:37.230
>> Because he's the
other most known.

1:03:37.230,1:03:39.857
It's almost like--
lately, have you

1:03:39.899,1:03:41.692
been channeling
Aridif more than TReb?

1:03:41.692,1:03:42.652
>> Much more.

1:03:42.693,1:03:45.488
Much more than TReb
even at this point.

1:03:45.571,1:03:48.074
There is a high
resonance for him.

1:03:48.115,1:03:51.869
One of my friends
who makes videos,

1:03:51.869,1:03:55.581
he knows that I'm kind of a
modest person in a lot of ways.

1:03:55.623,1:03:57.542
And he puts up this
thing, "Greatest Channeler

1:03:57.542,1:03:58.584
In The World on YouTube."

1:03:58.584,1:04:01.087
And I said, dude, well,
you didn't even tell me.

1:04:01.128,1:04:02.797
You would have asked
me to take it down.

1:04:02.797,1:04:03.965
I said, no, I wouldn't have.

1:04:03.965,1:04:05.675
But still.

1:04:05.675,1:04:10.054
He said something that
really clicked with me.

1:04:10.096,1:04:13.224
He said the wisdom
and essence of Bashar,

1:04:13.224,1:04:14.642
because a lot of
people know Bashar

1:04:14.684,1:04:19.313
as a very wise high energy
being, and the heart

1:04:19.313,1:04:22.775
center of TReb, which
TReb's a huge love bucket.

1:04:22.775,1:04:23.901
Everybody loves that.

1:04:23.901,1:04:25.820
And he said, that's
what Aridif encompasses.

1:04:25.820,1:04:29.365
And that's why Aridif is his
favorite channeled being.

1:04:29.407,1:04:31.492
So people are dying
for Aridif right now.

1:04:31.492,1:04:33.828
They want to have time with him.

1:04:33.869,1:04:35.746
They want to hear
what he has to say.

1:04:35.746,1:04:37.290
Brilliant, brilliant being.

1:04:37.290,1:04:41.127
He is to TReb what
TReb is to me.

1:04:41.168,1:04:41.961
>> Oh.

1:04:41.961,1:04:45.339
>> So like when you look at
me, TReb is like maybe a future

1:04:45.339,1:04:46.340
version of myself.

1:04:46.340,1:04:48.509
And it could be looked at
in a lot of different ways.

1:04:48.551,1:04:50.052
But he's like a guide to me.

1:04:50.052,1:04:52.346
He's a higher density,
higher knowledge

1:04:52.388,1:04:53.472
being that I pull from.

1:04:53.472,1:04:54.265
>> TReb is to you.

1:04:54.265,1:04:55.057
>> Yes.

1:04:55.057,1:04:57.226
TReb, for my
information and energy.

1:04:57.268,1:04:59.228
And TReb does that with Aridif.

1:04:59.228,1:05:00.980
TReb's a fifth density being.

1:05:01.022,1:05:02.523
And Aridif's a
sixth density being.

1:05:02.523,1:05:06.277
So energetically,
it's a higher energy.

1:05:06.319,1:05:07.528
>> And do TReb and Aridif--

1:05:07.528,1:05:08.905
I assume, they do communicate?

1:05:08.905,1:05:09.780
They know each other?

1:05:09.780,1:05:11.407
>> They know each other well.

1:05:11.449,1:05:13.367
I had heard stories about
Aridif before I ever

1:05:13.367,1:05:14.952
connected with him.

1:05:14.994,1:05:17.330
Back when I heard it--
because most of these entities

1:05:17.371,1:05:19.874
don't have names of their
own, they just have energy.

1:05:19.916,1:05:20.708
>> Right.

1:05:20.708,1:05:22.710
>> And they give us names,
because we're humans,

1:05:22.710,1:05:24.211
and we need names to identify.

1:05:24.211,1:05:29.008
So TReb would talk about a
being called Deneb Cygnus.

1:05:29.050,1:05:31.135
And that's the Deneb,
like the star Deneb,

1:05:31.177,1:05:34.221
and Cygnus, the
constellation of the Swan.

1:05:34.263,1:05:37.558
And he said, this entity
named Deneb Cygnus,

1:05:37.600,1:05:39.268
and then he would tell
a story about him,

1:05:39.310,1:05:42.104
or tell a story about
information that Deneb Cygnus

1:05:42.104,1:05:43.189
had shared with him.

1:05:43.230,1:05:45.566
Well, eventually, I found
out through the book

1:05:45.608,1:05:49.028
that I did about TReb and his
people, that that was Aridif.

1:05:49.028,1:05:50.446
And Aridif gives us that name.

1:05:50.488,1:05:54.408
Aridif used that name with
humans a long time ago.

1:05:54.408,1:05:56.327
Let me-- yeah, and I'm
jumping ahead of myself.

1:05:56.369,1:05:58.371
So let me give a little
introduction to Aridif.

1:05:58.412,1:06:02.041
Aridif is an Ancient
Pleiadian entity,

1:06:02.083,1:06:03.626
but he lives in the
star called Deneb.

1:06:03.668,1:06:06.837
His race moved out
of the Pleiades star

1:06:06.837,1:06:10.633
system, which tens of
thousands of races live there.

1:06:10.675,1:06:13.511
They pulled their race out,
because energetically, they

1:06:13.552,1:06:16.514
needed a different--
he explained it

1:06:16.514,1:06:18.349
as, we needed room to grow.

1:06:18.391,1:06:23.938
But what I think is the
collective consciousness

1:06:23.938,1:06:27.692
of a race is very
similar to a star.

1:06:27.733,1:06:30.820
And in fact, that's why they
incorporate so much energy.

1:06:30.861,1:06:33.364
If it's a smaller
collective, it only

1:06:33.364,1:06:35.074
needs a little space to grow.

1:06:35.074,1:06:37.326
But when you have these
huge consciousnesses

1:06:37.368,1:06:40.371
and you have a lot of them,
they need energetic space.

1:06:40.371,1:06:43.624
And that is shown by the
star that they travel around.

1:06:43.624,1:06:47.044
And Deneb is this gigantic,
huge, supermassive,

1:06:47.044,1:06:50.548
like 150 times the
size of our sun.

1:06:50.548,1:06:52.925
And that's where his
race needed to go,

1:06:53.009,1:06:55.052
because they grew into that.

1:06:55.052,1:06:56.846
They sprung into a huge--

1:06:56.887,1:06:58.305
and when you listen
to Aridif, you

1:06:58.305,1:07:03.769
can tell more than just
his sentient energy, more

1:07:03.811,1:07:06.772
than his wisdom, he's
just huge expanded.

1:07:06.772,1:07:08.315
They're at the level
right before you

1:07:08.315,1:07:09.900
leave physical
reality altogether

1:07:09.942,1:07:12.611
and join the
oversoul energy back

1:07:12.611,1:07:13.988
in the planetary collective.

1:07:13.988,1:07:16.198
So I mean he's this huge being.

1:07:16.198,1:07:17.867
And now they inhabit this star.

1:07:17.908,1:07:20.453
And a lot of people ask about--

1:07:20.453,1:07:21.871
they don't know
what he looks like.

1:07:21.912,1:07:24.457
And there's some art out there
of him, and it's beautiful.

1:07:24.457,1:07:25.833
Kalina did art too.

1:07:25.875,1:07:27.960
She's been able to see
him too in her mind's eye.

1:07:28.002,1:07:30.212
Never TReb, but Aridif.

1:07:30.212,1:07:33.257
They had a past life where
she had met Aridif when

1:07:33.257,1:07:34.425
he physically came to Earth.

1:07:34.467,1:07:35.342
>> When he was Deneb.

1:07:35.342,1:07:36.594
>> Back in ancient Egypt.

1:07:36.635,1:07:38.262
>> When he was known as Deneb?

1:07:38.262,1:07:39.054
>> Well, no.

1:07:39.096,1:07:42.099
The Aridif name was one
that was known to Earth,

1:07:42.099,1:07:45.644
but TReb never gave me
that identity until later.

1:07:45.686,1:07:48.939
So he was still known as Aridif
when I first heard of him,

1:07:48.939,1:07:53.819
but TReb, for whatever reason,
gave me the Deneb Cygnus name.

1:07:53.903,1:07:57.531
>> So back in the Egyptian days,
he was known as Aridif as well?

1:07:57.573,1:08:00.993
>> Well, he said the name came
from the era and how they knew

1:08:01.035,1:08:01.827
him.

1:08:01.827,1:08:04.079
So maybe they knew
what star he came from,

1:08:04.121,1:08:06.874
and back then they might
have called it Aridif.

1:08:06.916,1:08:07.750
>> Oh, I see.

1:08:07.750,1:08:09.627
>> I still don't
know the specifics,

1:08:09.627,1:08:09.919
but I think that's what it is.

1:08:09.919,1:08:12.630
>> So maybe in Egyptian times,
that's what they called them.

1:08:12.630,1:08:13.005
>> Right.

1:08:13.005,1:08:13.464
>> OK.

1:08:13.464,1:08:15.049
>> And he hung out
with Egyptians.

1:08:15.049,1:08:17.259
He just recently
alluded to the fact

1:08:17.259,1:08:20.137
that he had hung out with
South African tribes,

1:08:20.179,1:08:23.599
that he hung out with
Egyptians, that he hung out

1:08:23.641,1:08:27.436
with Indians, and some
Southern American tribes.

1:08:27.478,1:08:31.315
So he has been on the Earth
manifested as a physical being

1:08:31.315,1:08:34.944
in order to co-create
with Earth before,

1:08:34.944,1:08:36.737
kind of like an energetic
quarantine, where

1:08:36.737,1:08:39.448
it was kind of interference.

1:08:39.490,1:08:42.034
And that's a difficult,
long subject to get into.

1:08:42.034,1:08:45.246
But he has co-created
with humans.

1:08:45.246,1:08:47.498
And I think that him
understanding humanity

1:08:47.540,1:08:50.501
before he came here, even though
it was a much older version,

1:08:50.501,1:08:54.588
gave him a great opportunity
when he teaches to have

1:08:54.588,1:08:56.131
it really resonate with people.

1:08:56.173,1:08:59.301
Plus the amount of wisdom that
comes out of him is ungodly.

1:08:59.343,1:09:00.970
It's just beautiful.

1:09:01.011,1:09:04.849
>> So Aridif used to interact
with the human race back

1:09:04.849,1:09:08.936
in the day; South Africans,
Egyptians, probably more.

1:09:08.936,1:09:10.312
But has it been a while then?

1:09:10.354,1:09:12.815
Is this like his--

1:09:12.815,1:09:14.275
he took a break,
and now he's back.

1:09:14.275,1:09:16.277
And humanity is like, oh,
wow, look at humanity.

1:09:16.277,1:09:18.028
Or has he been
constantly monitoring?

1:09:18.028,1:09:20.781
And do other people
channel Aridif?

1:09:20.865,1:09:23.742
>> From what I know,
no one else has.

1:09:23.742,1:09:27.246
Some people said that
his energy is familiar.

1:09:27.288,1:09:29.248
So I don't know.

1:09:29.290,1:09:32.376
But I do know that
he's been interacting

1:09:32.418,1:09:34.336
with humans for a long time.

1:09:34.336,1:09:38.007
It's been thousands of years, he
said, before he's reconnected.

1:09:38.048,1:09:40.134
And even now he's not
physically connecting.

1:09:40.176,1:09:40.968
>> Right.

1:09:40.968,1:09:44.221
>> Right now, it's an important
growth time for humans.

1:09:44.221,1:09:47.308
And a lot of the
hands-on interactions

1:09:47.349,1:09:51.437
are not appreciated
by some of the ETs.

1:09:51.437,1:09:53.522
For instance, type
1 and type 2, this

1:09:53.522,1:09:56.192
is the definition Aridif
and TReb have given.

1:09:56.233,1:09:59.570
Type 1, they'll do it in the
way that TReb and Aridif are.

1:09:59.612,1:10:02.489
>> Type 1 civilization
or type 1 ET?

1:10:02.531,1:10:05.951
>> Type 1 extraterrestrial
kind, energetic kind.

1:10:05.951,1:10:07.453
>> And what is--

1:10:07.536,1:10:12.291
>> A type 1 defined is an entity
who respects the free will

1:10:12.291,1:10:14.043
of all things,
will not interfere.

1:10:14.084,1:10:14.877
>> OK.

1:10:14.877,1:10:18.339
>> And looks above and below
them, energetically speaking.

1:10:18.339,1:10:21.425
They look above them
for inspiration, wisdom,

1:10:21.467,1:10:22.426
to incorporate.

1:10:22.426,1:10:24.970
And then below them to
redistribute that information.

1:10:25.012,1:10:26.555
They see themselves
as a part of one.

1:10:26.555,1:10:27.348
>> I see.

1:10:27.348,1:10:28.724
>> A type 2 sees division.

1:10:28.724,1:10:32.770
A type 2 being only
looks below them

1:10:32.811,1:10:37.316
for what they can
overpower or oversee.

1:10:37.358,1:10:38.525
They never look above them.

1:10:38.525,1:10:41.987
They look equal or below to
them, energetically speaking.

1:10:42.029,1:10:45.616
They also are not afraid
to interject themselves

1:10:45.616,1:10:48.827
on the behalf of
themselves or others.

1:10:48.869,1:10:52.122
For instance, a lot of
these channeled entities

1:10:52.122,1:10:53.749
that have come out
are talking about,

1:10:53.749,1:10:54.959
we are going to help you.

1:10:55.000,1:10:56.293
We're going to do this for you.

1:10:56.293,1:10:57.836
We're going to do that for you.

1:10:57.836,1:10:59.838
They're doing that, because--

1:10:59.880,1:11:01.382
some of them with great intent.

1:11:01.423,1:11:02.633
They are like, we love you.

1:11:02.633,1:11:03.425
You're messing up.

1:11:03.425,1:11:04.593
We want to help you.

1:11:04.593,1:11:06.929
But in their mind, they
know better than we do.

1:11:06.971,1:11:08.681
And Aridif and TReb
come from a place

1:11:08.722,1:11:11.600
that you guys manifest what
you want as a collective,

1:11:11.600,1:11:13.852
because that is what you want.

1:11:13.852,1:11:15.312
And we will respect
your journey.

1:11:15.312,1:11:18.107
Even if you nuke yourself to
oblivion, we will respect it.

1:11:18.148,1:11:20.067
And we will never
step in the way.

1:11:20.067,1:11:22.236
Because they know
it's a soul's journey.

1:11:22.236,1:11:25.280
The other entities look at it
as a physical thing, or even

1:11:25.322,1:11:28.993
a soul level, just at
a different interval.

1:11:28.993,1:11:31.495
So these are the
fundamental differences.

1:11:31.537,1:11:35.708
And back when Aridif did
interact with humans,

1:11:35.708,1:11:37.501
he did it from his
incarnation now,

1:11:37.543,1:11:40.671
but he also has done it
from previous incarnations

1:11:40.671,1:11:42.589
of his Denebian race.

1:11:42.673,1:11:43.716
So in that way--

1:11:43.716,1:11:44.758
>> Denebian race.

1:11:44.800,1:11:45.092
>> Yeah.

1:11:45.092,1:11:47.052
And Ancient Pleiadians
is what we call it,

1:11:47.052,1:11:49.096
because that's how he
introduced themselves.

1:11:49.138,1:11:52.641
But Denebian, that's
another term for their race.

1:11:52.683,1:11:53.934
They're from the star Deneb.

1:11:53.934,1:11:57.271
So Denebians are
another term for them.

1:11:57.271,1:12:02.943
But they have interacted
from previous incarnations.

1:12:02.943,1:12:05.404
So he dealt with humans
not just in this life,

1:12:05.404,1:12:06.655
but his past lives too.

1:12:06.655,1:12:07.448
>> Interesting.

1:12:07.489,1:12:08.282
OK.

1:12:08.282,1:12:10.492
And the overall message--

1:12:10.492,1:12:13.787
so they're obviously type 1 ETs.

1:12:13.829,1:12:16.123
And their overall message,
if you could sum it up

1:12:16.123,1:12:18.208
>> If I could sum it
up in one sentence,

1:12:18.292,1:12:20.627
it's you create everything.

1:12:20.627,1:12:24.965
And If I could sum it
up in a small paragraph,

1:12:25.007,1:12:27.926
we create that physical
reality around us,

1:12:27.968,1:12:29.928
and every aspect of it.

1:12:29.928,1:12:33.390
And when we do, we
bring the reflections

1:12:33.474,1:12:38.103
of what's inside of ourselves
to be outside of ourselves

1:12:38.145,1:12:39.104
and to co-create.

1:12:39.104,1:12:41.648
So a lot of people look at it.

1:12:41.648,1:12:45.027
Well, how is Reuben
a projection of Rob?

1:12:45.027,1:12:46.820
Well, it has to be.

1:12:46.862,1:12:49.281
There's you there,
and there's me there.

1:12:49.281,1:12:51.825
But I'm bringing you into
my reality for a reason,

1:12:51.867,1:12:52.868
as you are me.

1:12:52.868,1:12:55.329
We're co-creating a reflection.

1:12:55.371,1:12:58.624
And literally, you're
a version that I

1:12:58.624,1:13:00.584
projected into my universe.

1:13:00.626,1:13:02.252
But it's very literal
in those terms.

1:13:02.294,1:13:03.962
And people don't look
at it in that way.

1:13:03.962,1:13:05.631
They're like,
figuratively, you create.

1:13:05.631,1:13:07.257
No, literally.

1:13:07.299,1:13:09.093
And figuratively.

1:13:09.093,1:13:09.968
>> Right.

1:13:10.010,1:13:11.678
>> That's the message.

1:13:11.678,1:13:14.181
And they explore
all parts of it.

1:13:14.223,1:13:17.309
They give answers for
extraterrestrial things.

1:13:17.393,1:13:19.812
What's going on in our galaxy?

1:13:19.812,1:13:23.065
I've always termed it universal,
or galactic knowledge,

1:13:23.107,1:13:25.442
universal knowledge,
what's going on out there.

1:13:25.442,1:13:28.445
And that's an important part.

1:13:28.445,1:13:31.657
The other entities, too,
that I've channeled,

1:13:31.698,1:13:34.243
Nihal, Metatron.

1:13:34.284,1:13:37.663
Metatron would say that
the universal and galactic

1:13:37.663,1:13:39.957
knowledge is not so important.

1:13:39.998,1:13:43.418
What's important is you
growing into who you are.

1:13:43.418,1:13:46.255
So sometimes he talks about
humans distract themselves

1:13:46.255,1:13:48.632
with what's going on out there
when they can't figure out

1:13:48.632,1:13:49.633
what's going on down here.

1:13:49.633,1:13:49.967
>> Sure.

1:13:49.967,1:13:52.010
>> A different point of
view, and I respect that.

1:13:52.010,1:13:53.679
And I understand.

1:13:53.720,1:13:58.851
But TReb and Aridif bring us a
perspective that's universal.

1:13:58.851,1:14:01.520
And it gives us our
opportunity to say

1:14:01.562,1:14:05.399
how humans fit in this universal
complex, which is something

1:14:05.399,1:14:07.401
that a lot of
people have strived

1:14:07.443,1:14:09.153
to know their whole lives.

1:14:09.153,1:14:13.532
And it's very easy to see the
human race as a part of it,

1:14:13.574,1:14:16.410
but not how each individual
is a part of first the Earth

1:14:16.410,1:14:17.828
collective, then
the universalness.

1:14:17.870,1:14:19.371
It's amazing.

1:14:19.413,1:14:22.499
It's something that
Aridif sums up very well.

1:14:22.541,1:14:25.544
>> And just you
mentioned the Nihal.

1:14:25.544,1:14:26.462
>> Yes.

1:14:26.462,1:14:28.172
>> Is that a collective
consciousness?

1:14:28.213,1:14:29.006
>> Yes.

1:14:29.006,1:14:30.799
That is a collective
consciousness.

1:14:30.883,1:14:33.051
Now, the Nihal, a very
interesting story.

1:14:33.051,1:14:34.928
I'll give you a bit about them.

1:14:34.928,1:14:37.890
The Nihal are future humans.

1:14:37.890,1:14:41.727
They exist as one of our
timelines in the future.

1:14:41.727,1:14:46.273
So it's a probable reality
where we leave Earth.

1:14:46.315,1:14:48.317
Well, not all of us,
but a chunk of us

1:14:48.358,1:14:50.277
leave Earth and
become the Nihal.

1:14:50.277,1:14:54.698
And we evolve into very
short beings, about--

1:14:54.698,1:14:57.534
I can't remember-- three to
four foot, somewhere in there.

1:14:57.576,1:15:00.370
Orange-ish skin, highly psychic.

1:15:00.370,1:15:02.164
And we evolve into that.

1:15:02.164,1:15:05.584
Now, the fun part, the
part where it ties back in,

1:15:05.626,1:15:10.297
the Nihal are the race
who seeded TReb's race.

1:15:10.339,1:15:15.594
So TReb's race was a
byproduct, or a direct product,

1:15:15.594,1:15:20.057
of engineering DNA
from a human being DNA

1:15:20.057,1:15:24.311
and from a second density lizard
being who lived in, I believe,

1:15:24.353,1:15:26.521
the Capellan region, which
is where TReb comes from.

1:15:26.563,1:15:29.650
>> Human or Nihal DNA,
but Nihal being human.

1:15:29.650,1:15:30.442
>> Right.

1:15:30.442,1:15:30.692
Nihal.

1:15:30.692,1:15:32.402
But it is different
than human DNA.

1:15:32.444,1:15:34.238
And that's a good
point you bring up.

1:15:35.989,1:15:39.660
also occurs when one race
leaves their home planet

1:15:39.701,1:15:41.286
and goes to another.

1:15:41.286,1:15:43.830
The planet itself is a being.

1:15:43.872,1:15:46.333
It's a seventh density
collective being.

1:15:46.333,1:15:47.125
>> Right.

1:15:47.125,1:15:49.753
>> And then this race that
comes is also a collective

1:15:49.795,1:15:52.756
of the seventh density with
all the oversouls at the lower

1:15:52.756,1:15:54.132
seventh density.

1:15:54.132,1:15:55.133
And then they meet.

1:15:55.133,1:15:56.927
They co-create a
brand new energy.

1:15:56.969,1:16:00.430
So both collectives merge
into one, and the DNA changes.

1:16:00.472,1:16:03.892
And that's why when the human
race leaves the other planets,

1:16:03.892,1:16:06.270
they change their physical
appearance, because their DNA

1:16:06.270,1:16:07.145
changes.

1:16:07.187,1:16:10.107
Their physical body
adapts to the new merging

1:16:10.107,1:16:12.276
of the collective
planet consciousness

1:16:12.317,1:16:14.069
and their race's consciousness.

1:16:14.069,1:16:16.363
So that's a part of it too.

1:16:16.405,1:16:19.992
Now, when we're
getting into the Nihal,

1:16:20.075,1:16:22.619
the reason for doing TReb's
race, a lot of people

1:16:22.661,1:16:24.621
are like, well, if we're
evolved, why would we

1:16:24.621,1:16:25.539
be messing with DNA?

1:16:25.581,1:16:26.623
We've had that done to us.

1:16:26.665,1:16:28.750
It's not very nice.

1:16:28.750,1:16:31.795
There's such a stigma around
negative reptilian energy.

1:16:31.837,1:16:34.131
And it was hinted, not
ever directly said,

1:16:34.131,1:16:36.008
yes, this is the 100% reason.

1:16:36.008,1:16:40.304
But TReb, Aridif, but more so
than that, another entity who

1:16:40.345,1:16:45.183
I channeled in the book about
TReb's race, one of their--

1:16:45.225,1:16:46.893
I think it was the
military, ex-military.

1:16:46.893,1:16:47.853
>> The woman?

1:16:47.853,1:16:48.937
>> Yes, the woman.

1:16:48.979,1:16:53.317
She said that the reason
that they did that

1:16:53.358,1:16:56.528
was so that they could show
the entire galaxy that not

1:16:56.528,1:16:57.988
all reptilians are bad.

1:16:57.988,1:17:01.408
The stigma of Earth,
especially Earth,

1:17:01.450,1:17:03.702
was that reptilians
are negative.

1:17:03.744,1:17:05.329
They will eat your children.

1:17:05.329,1:17:06.121
They'll drug you.

1:17:06.121,1:17:08.915
They'll throw you in a cave,
and put you in their pie.

1:17:08.999,1:17:10.626
>> What is it the--

1:17:10.626,1:17:13.795
David Icke, the queen, and all
of our government officials

1:17:13.795,1:17:14.838
evolved.

1:17:14.880,1:17:17.174
Evil reptilians taking
over the planet.

1:17:17.215,1:17:18.342
>> And I get it.

1:17:18.383,1:17:21.261
>> That could--
that's probably true.

1:17:21.261,1:17:24.222
>> But not every
reptilian has that.

1:17:24.222,1:17:25.098
>> Yeah, exactly.

1:17:25.140,1:17:27.934
>> And TReb-- this is
something I commend TReb for.

1:17:27.976,1:17:30.103
He is one of the very few
channels who have come out

1:17:30.103,1:17:33.231
and said, listen, the
evil reptilians are there.

1:17:33.231,1:17:34.608
This is what
they've done to you.

1:17:34.608,1:17:37.611
This is how they're still
doing things to you.

1:17:37.653,1:17:40.280
But you're focusing on it, and
it's going to keep going on.

1:17:40.280,1:17:43.492
When you pull your focus from it
and start focusing on the power

1:17:43.533,1:17:46.912
you have, then it doesn't-- then
even if they're standing next

1:17:46.912,1:17:50.624
to you slapping people with
whips, they can't touch you.

1:17:50.707,1:17:52.667
>> Just like Jesus
and the cross.

1:17:52.667,1:17:59.049
It was much-- the
story's go as much

1:17:59.091,1:18:01.259
they were whipping
him and torturing him,

1:18:01.259,1:18:02.386
he didn't feel a thing.

1:18:02.469,1:18:03.261
>> Yeah.

1:18:03.261,1:18:05.347
And that's the
beauty part of it.

1:18:05.389,1:18:07.432
That's something that
TReb brings to us.

1:18:07.474,1:18:09.226
And the Nihal wanted
to show us that.

1:18:09.226,1:18:11.311
They wanted to show us--

1:18:11.311,1:18:14.523
I think it was targeted for
humans, but around the galaxy,

1:18:14.564,1:18:16.358
there's still a stigma
that most reptilians

1:18:16.358,1:18:17.859
are neg-- even if
they've interacted

1:18:17.859,1:18:20.112
with a good reptilian.

1:18:20.153,1:18:23.031
Humanoids, I think, because
of the damage they've

1:18:23.073,1:18:26.410
had through slavery, the
Anunnaki was half-reptilian,

1:18:26.410,1:18:28.870
the ancient reptilians,
the Earth reptilians.

1:18:28.912,1:18:31.164
Those are all bad
stories for humans.

1:18:31.164,1:18:35.127
And that's kind of built
in our DNA to fear them.

1:18:35.127,1:18:38.630
And people, like David Icke,
who've research just that part

1:18:38.672,1:18:41.299
of it and shared it, it
scares the crap out of people.

1:18:41.341,1:18:45.262
>> It continues
to feed into that.

1:18:45.262,1:18:47.681
Well, over the next
couple of days,

1:18:47.722,1:18:49.015
let's get into some channeling.

1:18:49.015,1:18:52.894
And I'd love to talk to TReb and
Aridif and explore their world

1:18:52.936,1:18:53.729
some more.

1:18:53.729,1:18:56.773
Thanks for sharing
your adventures.

1:18:56.815,1:18:58.024
>> You're absolutely welcome.

1:18:58.024,1:18:59.609
>> And we'll see
some more of you.

1:18:59.609,1:19:00.402
>> All right.

1:19:00.444,1:19:01.236
>> Thanks, Rob.
