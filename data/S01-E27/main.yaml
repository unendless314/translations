  source_text: And in doing this type of exploration, it allows me to experience extraterrestrial
    civilizations from a variety of choices in terms of who they choose to be as individuals,
    as a society, This, then, for me is a great joy to explore, experience, and learn
    from other civilizations, other extraterrestrial beings, other worlds, other ways
    of life, other forms of experiencing the infinite, that we all are, unconditional
    love, that we all are.
