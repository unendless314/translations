many factors involved in facilitating alignment with your civilizations, aligning in alignment with an organic unfoldment as though you're awakening to this ET reality is coming through as though it

sense, that is about as far as you've gotten in this analogy, with your growth at this point."},{"segment_id":118,"speaker_group":30,"source_text":"Beginning to break the surface, the seed of a plant,

ground is the longest time."},{"segment_id":120,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"But once it starts to sprout, it comes very fast, so hopefully that's the case."},{"segment_id":121,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"And in a sense, as more of you embrace this, you are like the sun giving light to this, that it may grow even faster, but all the while in its own appropriate rate."},{"segment_id":122,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"It will not grow faster than it can."},{"segment_id":123,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"There are times in your plant

faster."},{"segment_id":124,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"And there are then those in your world who do at times and will continue to try and accelerate the rate to even try and genetically alter it in a sense to be something other than that which they might perceive it would be if it were allowed to grow into its own tree and create its own fruit in a sense."},{"segment_id":125,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"So there are some who would have an idea to try and genetically alter the outcome."},{"segment_id":126,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"Again, there are many forces, factors, beings of high intelligence within the one that has the all-- that are very focused here with all

occurred."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":83,"source_text":"And is this Yahyel civilization?"},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":84,"source_text":"Primarily, this was of our co-creation with your civilization, although we were not alone in terms of extraterrestrial civilizations."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":84,"source_text":"But it was primarily our civilization bringing a larger input into your awareness on a conscious level of our existence at a time and in a way that on a super-conscious level, your civilization knew about in advance, agreed to, co-created, understood,

that come out, come through, evolve,"},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":84,"source_text":"develop in that way."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"Well, it still is a large imprint on the collective consciousness and continues to expand, so thank you."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"And there were others before, perhaps not as

craft."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"They will seem to be very organic in form, and shape, and coloration as though they are phenomena of space and time itself."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":87,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":87,"source_text":"Would you be able to name some of these other civilizations that you work with closely?"},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"They are those you are most familiar with at this time in terms of the ones that are to focus and be aware of."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"There are others."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"Yes, but not to come through at this time, simply because you will then, through your own mechanisms, begin focusing and expanding your focus when truly focusing your focus will bring greater connection in a more heartfelt, intelligent way, allowing for clarity through simplification, focus."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"Pleiadians-- yes."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"There are certainly a variety of Pleiadian

from the Pleiadian civilization as we do?"},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":90,"source_text":"There are-- yes."},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":90,"source_text":"In a sense, there is no end to this."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":91,"source_text":"Yeah, it just goes forever."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":92,"source_text":"Learning which then will be most applicable for you in unfolding a future and a present that you most enjoy fulfillingly, will then provide the greatest excitement for you."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":92,"source_text":"Understand, then, to know that there are in a sense no end to the numbers to suggest that it is not finite, perhaps allows you to focus more on a finite number of them."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":92,"source_text":"To know that there are an infinite number."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":92,"source_text":"And in this physical embodiment, your awareness will not truly embody all of the infinite number of them

that."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"Yes, it is definitely a joy."},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"It's so expansive into--"},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":96,"source_text":"It will guide you beyond that which you are aware or have heard of in terms of trying to create a family tree of sorts or a point of origination, for the point changes as you learn of the next one, and then changes as you learn of the next one."},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":97,"source_text":"Yeah, that seems to be the case, and that's exciting."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":98,"source_text":"Yes, understand."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"That's fun."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"That's a lot of fun."},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"How would you describe, from your perspective, the angelic realms that we consider on our Earth plane?"},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"They are non-physical beings that support Earth humans in your life here."},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"They can be thought of as angelic beings."},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"There are extraterrestrials who are in the physical form who support Earth Humans."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"And Earth humans might not be aware of this coming from physical extraterrestrials who might then define their experience and communications as coming from angels or spirit guides."},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"So an extraterrestrial could be for someone on Earth, thought of as an angel or a spirit guide, even though they are physical, all the while then being some angels and spirit guides for an Earth human's experience are non-physical consciousnesses."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"So it comes down to, then, which a person is connecting to, to decide or determine, is it a non-physical or a physical being that they are defining or experiencing as an angel, or a spirit guide, or communication with extraterrestrial?"},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":101,"source_text":"And in your realm where you exist, do you work with-- I'm assuming you work as we do with a lot of these non-physical energies."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":102,"source_text":"Yes, there are a variety of non-physical consciousnesses that support the matrix in a sense, the physical experience, the experience of physicality."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":102,"source_text":"There are a variety of consciousnesses interacting that allow for the way we and you are experiencing physicality, that which holds what you experience as time and space in a sense, in a physical spectrum."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":102,"source_text":"There are consciousnesses that are involved in this that have evolved to be more focused at doing that, that are in a sense, born to do that, in a sense, gifted at doing that."},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":102,"source_text":"It is their joy in a sense to be that support to live life, almost as if they are the substance that holds the physical experience of your life together."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":103,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":104,"source_text":"Conscious being."},{"segment_id":275,"speaker_group":104,"source_text":"So even, for example, a peach or an apple-- physical item you experience contains some of these conscious beings."},{"segment_id":276,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"And this goes back to what Shaun and I were talking about earlier."},{"segment_id":277,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"When we consume these consciousnesses, we're putting in what-- what you put out is what you get back."},{"segment_id":278,"speaker_group":106,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":279,"speaker_group":106,"source_text":"Now, what you put in, what you put out is what you get back or live within."},{"segment_id":280,"speaker_group":107,"source_text":"So having awareness of what types of consciousness we consume can help us in our external reality?"},{"segment_id":281,"speaker_group":108,"source_text":"Yes, it is conscious energies and entities, beings, lifeforms that you are consuming in the food that you are consuming or the chemistry that you are consuming that is interblended with some of the foods or many of the foods that are constructed at this time that many people on Earth are eating, construction of synthetic and chemical consciousnesses with other types of organic consciousnesses."},{"segment_id":282,"speaker_group":109,"source_text":"And I'm assuming the constructor-- the cook, the preparer of these foods also puts in their own consciousnesses in the mix."},{"segment_id":283,"speaker_group":109,"source_text":"And then it becomes--"},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":110,"source_text":"Certainly."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":110,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":111,"source_text":"--a consciousness soup--"},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":112,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":288,"speaker_group":113,"source_text":"--and can become quite tasty if you have a good one."},{"segment_id":289,"speaker_group":114,"source_text":"Very much so."},{"segment_id":290,"speaker_group":115,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":291,"speaker_group":115,"source_text":"So what we're enjoying is not just the taste, but we're also enjoying all the other different consciousnesses that are-- go into that making of this wonderful creation we call like an apple pie or--"},{"segment_id":292,"speaker_group":116,"source_text":"That can play a part in it."},{"segment_id":293,"speaker_group":116,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":294,"speaker_group":117,"source_text":"Wonderful."},{"segment_id":295,"speaker_group":117,"source_text":"Many of these

this."},{"segment_id":297,"speaker_group":117,"source_text":"Are you part of..."},{"segment_id":298,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"We interact with those of extraterrestrial origin that, in that way, choose to come together and interact spontaneously to gather enjoyably, supportively to gather."},{"segment_id":299,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"When one is no longer in a moment of joy, they will become focused on another venture or activity that is more exciting."},{"segment_id":300,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"And they will move along."},{"segment_id":301,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"They may come back at another time."},{"segment_id":302,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"In this way, it is always an interaction of very positive communication and support."},{"segment_id":303,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"We can give it names."},{"segment_id":304,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"But it is free from friction and conflict that is imbued or envisoned in your televisions and that which is in the pan of vision of the theater and theatrical movie releases."},{"segment_id":305,"speaker_group":119,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":306,"speaker_group":119,"source_text":"We sort of formulate our version of that idea and then--"},{"segment_id":307,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":308,"speaker_group":121,"source_text":"--put it into a context that we can understand--"},{"segment_id":309,"speaker_group":122,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":310,"speaker_group":123,"source_text":"--in our specific timeline evolution."},{"segment_id":311,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"So our interaction is friction free in that way."},{"segment_id":312,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"We are not fighting."},{"segment_id":313,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"We are not trying to commandeer some other civilization's desires and wishes to supplant our own."},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"There are no secret bodies within one or the other of these civilizations trying to take control of the whole body, so to speak."},{"segment_id":315,"speaker_group":125,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":316,"speaker_group":126,"source_text":"That is an illusory reflection of beliefs that are illusory beliefs."},{"segment_id":317,"speaker_group":126,"source_text":"And we do not in that way contain those in our experience."},{"segment_id":318,"speaker_group":127,"source_text":"Very human construct."},{"segment_id":319,"speaker_group":128,"source_text":"Earth human, Yes."},{"segment_id":320,"speaker_group":129,"source_text":"Earth human."},{"segment_id":321,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"Those that you have in your film and television-- Earth human constructs with beliefs that are illusory, illusory being out of alignment with your actual nature."},{"segment_id":322,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"We understand our actual nature."},{"segment_id":323,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"And therefore, the beliefs that which we put within and experience are in alignment with the actual nature of existence, of unconditional love, of the one that is the all, the all that is the one."},{"segment_id":324,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"And because we know this and we put that out, we get back experiences in alignment with that."},{"segment_id":325,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"It's that simple."},{"segment_id":326,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"We know who we are."},{"segment_id":327,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"We put out beliefs that are in alignment with who we are."},{"segment_id":328,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"The one that is the all

understand."},{"segment_id":332,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":333,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"There are people on our planet-- Shaun and myself who-- we were just talking earlier that we sort of live these rules."},{"segment_id":334,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"We sort of live these ideas and are physically manifesting this sort of non-friction way of life."},{"segment_id":335,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"But the human spectrum seems to be so great that Shaun and I can be having this experience of non-friction, yet on another side of the planet, there are others who still embrace this idea of friction."},{"segment_id":336,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"I guess I'm saying is we have such a wide variety on Earth."},{"segment_id":337,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"I'm curious to know the variety on the Yahyel civilization."},{"segment_id":338,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"It sounds like it doesn't go to that extreme."},{"segment_id":339,"speaker_group":132,"source_text":"It is an infinite variety within the vibration of alignment with actual nature."},{"segment_id":340,"speaker_group":133,"source_text":"Earth alignment."},{"segment_id":341,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"The Earth frictions are the result of putting out beliefs that are illusory, out of alignment with one's actual nature."},{"segment_id":342,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"And thus, putting that out, they get back friction."},{"segment_id":343,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"That is a choice within the infinite that can exist for an infinite period in a sense."},{"segment_id":344,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"The infinite contains all that can be."},{"segment_id":345,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"And that can include those who, currently through their upbringing and state of awareness, choose to create friction."},{"segment_id":346,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"That can continue to exist within the infinite for an infinite amount of time."},{"segment_id":347,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"The idea is you could choose to only experience the free from friction, that which is alignment with actual nature, that which is filled with an infinite number of ways to experience being in alignment with the joy."},{"segment_id":348,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"The friction-free experiences are infinite in number, unlimited."},{"segment_id":349,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"So each person has a choice and has the ability to choose."},{"segment_id":350,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"Do they want to play around in the illusory beliefs that create the frictions or move off into the realm of unhindered joy and excitement in ways that are free from friction, that are fully fulfilling and fascinating, one moment to the next-- new, new, refreshing."},{"segment_id":351,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"That they're in that realm-- are an infinite number of unlimited realities that can unfold now, and now, and now, it is a choice that you can make."},{"segment_id":352,"speaker_group":135,"source_text":"So as we move individually-- as we move into these non-friction realms, these infinite possibilities of joy and non-friction, will we begin to see less and less other people having friction and I guess--"},{"segment_id":353,"speaker_group":136,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":354,"speaker_group":137,"source_text":"--in our realities as well?"},{"segment_id":355,"speaker_group":138,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":356,"speaker_group":139,"source_text":"OK, so we attract those people who are also in that same vibratory rate."},{"segment_id":357,"speaker_group":139,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":358,"speaker_group":139,"source_text":"And the frictioners-- if that's a title, we can call them frictioners--"},{"segment_id":359,"speaker_group":140,"source_text":"The frictioners."},{"segment_id":360,"speaker_group":141,"source_text":"--will become sort of less and less, until eventually there's just no frictioners left on the planet."},{"segment_id":361,"speaker_group":142,"source_text":"They will not be a part of your experience."},{"segment_id":362,"speaker_group":142,"source_text":"They will be too vibrational different."},{"segment_id":363,"speaker_group":143,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":364,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"You can and will in time, for it does exist-- a world, a Earth which all Earth humans are living and choosing to know who they are-- the

yourself."},{"segment_id":365,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"This is a reality that exists."},{"segment_id":366,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And you will in time be aware of it, because you

all."},{"segment_id":373,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"The all is the one."},{"segment_id":374,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"What you put out is what you get back."},{"segment_id":375,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"Or what you put within is what you live within."},{"segment_id":376,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"And everything is always changing, except those first ideas that I just mentioned--"},{"segment_id":377,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":378,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"--you have mentioned."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Those are not changing."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"And so you can always utilize the understanding of those to create an ever-changing experience of the infinite, that you are perceiving yourself to be a part of it perhaps?"},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Being a part of unconditional love or existence here and now and putting out the one that you want to be experiencing that of."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Then you get back that one of the all that is the one."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"In the way that you are most strongly choosing to put that out, you will get back."},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"You tune in."},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"You become in alignment with that existence, that experience, that vibratory reality."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Your ability to do this, then, never changes."},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"But how you do it will always change in a sense."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":149,"source_text":"And that's sort of the secret sauce, the magic formula for what some would say law of attraction."},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":149,"source_text":"We have many titles and many different--"},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"Yes, certainly."},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":151,"source_text":"--ways of creating our reality in this

gather, to interact, to gather in that way, physically in a sense."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":156,"source_text":"Ultimately, we let go of those in our deepest, most fulfilling interaction, in a sense, for life free from all such external creations of artificial intelligence in a sense."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":156,"source_text":"We will let go of those and engage in interaction

those."},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":156,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":157,"source_text":"So almost-- I've always had the idea that the internet is an external

heart."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":161,"source_text":"But we're using the internet to teach us something that we already have, kind of."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":162,"source_text":"It is."},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":163,"source_text":"Because I'm going to put this video out to the internet for people to view and understand that, oh, we actually have--"},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":164,"source_text":"For many, like an intermediary step in a sense."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":165,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":165,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":166,"source_text":"It is like

exactly."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":167,"source_text":"And so as I was saying earlier, these interactions with artificial intelligence that we're now creating-- is it sort of training wheels for interacting with extra-dimensional intelligences?"},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"It can be, for there are some that are interacting on that level."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"There is consciousness in the information that is being conveyed with the computers-- There is conscious civilizations of a sense, of a type that are allowing to make it possible for the computer information to be shared-- the information itself."},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"It isn't just information."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"It isn't just packets."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"It isn't just ones and

intelligence."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":170,"source_text":"Intelligence."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":171,"source_text":"Yes, just like our peaches and our--"},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":172,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"--apples."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"Many people are afraid."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"Many people are afraid of the internet."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"Many people are afraid of these

it."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"What would you say to those people?"},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"That is an aspect of the one that is the all that I am in a sense, that you are."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"So in a sense, I am in the question speaking of myself, to myself understanding that then being accepting of myself in that framework with those set of beliefs that are limiting my awareness of my actual nature, then I can be accepting of me behaving or choosing to have that experience in that way."},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Oh, there is an aspect of me that perceives that the computer is dangerous."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"All the while, anything that is, is existence and thus, then, is equal to all and everything else that exists."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Because existence is equal unto itself and always that it exists, actually."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"So for someone to take existence and create the idea that a computer that exists is dangerous, that is a concept that exists."},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Their perception that it is dangerous is existing."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"All of these things exist and thus, on that level of their existing, they are all equal to existence to the one that exists."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"That is the all that exists, the all that is the one, that I am, that you are existence."},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"And so the idea that someone thinks the computer is dangerous-- I can understand."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"They are utilizing the existence that is equaling unto itself to create the illusion that it is not, that it might be dangerous."},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"They are creating an illusion."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Because they have a belief system that does not enlighten them to be aware that the computer is existence."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"And thus, they are existence."},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"And thus, they are actually equal."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"And thus, they can't be dangerous, more or less."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"They are equal."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":175,"source_text":"So it's, again, going back to what you put out is what you get back."},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":176,"source_text":"And I understand it is them and that limited framework of belief system as simply creating a play, a theatrical play, an illusory belief, an illusory play."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":176,"source_text":"That can be very meaningful for them."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":176,"source_text":"And because it exists, it is equal to any play that I in my experience create, even the ones that are in alignment with the actual nature of existence."},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":176,"source_text":"Because they both exist, they are equal."},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":177,"source_text":"They're all possibilities, all options."},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"Everything is equal unto itself."},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"Because existence is that which is the base of all that is, whether it is a cloud, or a tree, or a person, or laughter, or a thought, or an action, or a statement, or a person."},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"It all exists."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"And then it is this-- all equal in its existence level of being, the one that is the all, the all that is the one."},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":179,"source_text":"So it's just my-- it's up to me whether I would choose to adopt that belief that that other person has."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":180,"source_text":"You could choose."},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":180,"source_text":"Or you could acknowledge, oh, he's just playing that--"},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"That game."},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"--form of illusion-- illusory limitation for his own choosing, for his own reasons."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"You can get up on stage and interact with him in that limited construct in whatever way you want."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"Try and let him know of a more expanded way to look at things."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"Or you can get very frightened as well, and team up with him, and combat computers."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":183,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":184,"source_text":"Your choice."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":185,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":487,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"But in order to be effective combating computers, you have to begin veiling yourself of the awareness of your actual nature."},{"segment_id":488,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"Because if you know everything is equal, you can't very well believe that something is dangerous or better or less than."},{"segment_id":489,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"So you have to get on the stage and play the part of the actor that believes, yes, it's dangerous."},{"segment_id":490,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"And to believe that, you have to put out all other beliefs that would tell you differently."},{"segment_id":491,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"So the awareness of your actual nature would prevent you from playing the illusion that the computer could be dangerous."},{"segment_id":492,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"But as soon as I sort of know in the framework that you just laid out-- as soon as I know that that's how things work, I sort of diffuse the danger."},{"segment_id":493,"speaker_group":188,"source_text":"Yes, because you realize it is another expression of the all, the one existence that you are--"},{"segment_id":494,"speaker_group":189,"source_text":"And it's just a--"},{"segment_id":495,"speaker_group":190,"source_text":"--that it is."},{"segment_id":496,"speaker_group":191,"source_text":"--possibility that I can choose to explore and like you said, play that role if I want to go there."},{"segment_id":497,"speaker_group":192,"source_text":"If you want to fit into that game in that theatrical presentation."},{"segment_id":498,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":194,"source_text":"It is entirely the choice of the individual who's choosing that reality."},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"Many in your world do not know of the other choices."},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"They think there are only these limited choices available to them."},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"They are not aware."},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"They do not know."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"They have not been shown that there is a whole buffet in a sense, a building full of choices, of beliefs that they can choose from and an unlimited number of choices that are in alignment with their actual nature."},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":197,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":198,"source_text":"And when someone begins to know that there are more choices-- well, as an analogy, if you were to go to a restaurant that only has one item available at the buffet and across the street, there's a building or restaurant that has 30 choices available."},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":198,"source_text":"Well, if you know there's 30, perhaps you're gonna stop going to the one that only has one choice."},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":198,"source_text":"Well, there's 30 over here."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":198,"source_text":"Maybe I want to try something different."},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"Or there's a hundred choices over here."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"This one has a thousand choices."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"Oh, there's somebody telling, no, there's only one choice."},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"Don't go there."},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"That food is bad for you."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"You eat that, you'll be sick."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"So it's just up to us to choose."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"And to know that it is infinite."},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"There's unlimited choices can be in alignment with friction and illusion, out of alignment with your actual nature."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"Or they can be choices that are in alignment with your actual nature."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"And there are an infinite number of those choices available as well."},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"You can choose the ones you want to."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"And knowing that we have the buffet--"},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"Knowing that you have the buffet, knowing that you have the choice will afford in almost every instant the individual's desire to take and move into the path of the infinite number of uplifting choices that are in alignment with one's actual nature."},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"Because it is effortless more and more, because it is in alignment with one's actual nature."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"It is not friction full."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"It is free of friction."},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"And it glides."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"And it slides easily and effortless in creating more experiences that are in alignment with one's actual nature."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"There is no need to hide to create beliefs that prevent one from knowing this or that in order to believe some illusory belief."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"Don't have to put a lot of weight on oneself with all these illusory beliefs."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"That can depress, and create sadness, and depression, and illness, and disease."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"By choosing the choices that are in alignment with one's actual nature of which there are an infinite number, the person experiences a greater sense of easefullness in their experience."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"And they are happy."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"And they are not being pressed upon."},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"They are free to flow, to be very spontaneous, flexible, and in that state to connect to more of the infinite of their heart's intelligence that can come in the appropriate time and moment that will serve them in each moment in the most uplifting, fulfilling, meaningful way."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":205,"source_text":"Which goes to ask, if you are sort of in a stuck idea or belief system that seems to have friction, then you simply ask the question, how does it serve me?"},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"To recognize if you're having an issue or an obstacle, then you must have a belief that's out of alignment with your actual effortless, flowing nature."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"And you can ask, then, if you are choosing this illusory belief, this discordant belief."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"Somehow you are defining it as being the most pleasurable and least painful choice, based on your current set of beliefs and definitions about what is available to you."},{"segment_id":545,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"When you get to the bottom of that, or the top of it, or the side of it, or get in the middle of it in any number of ways available to you and realize, I had this discordant belief about it."},{"segment_id":546,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"And that then I realized that isn't accurate."},{"segment_id":547,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"And no longer does that serve me as the most pleasurable and least painful choice to make."},{"segment_id":548,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"Person stops making that discordant choice and will replace it within a choice in belief that's more in alignment with their actual nature and then move more in alignment with their actual nature of being, putting out more beliefs in alignment with their actual nature and getting back more experiences in alignment with that."},{"segment_id":549,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"What you put out is what you get back in a sense."},{"segment_id":550,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"What you put within is experience you live within."},{"segment_id":551,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"Always you choose to put out what you perceive is closest to pleasure and farthest from pain."},{"segment_id":552,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"What you perceive as pleasure and pain is going to be unique to each of you."},{"segment_id":553,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"So the idea then is to choose that you're always putting out that which is most in alignment with your actual heart nature and farthest from that which would be out of alignment with your actual heart nature, your actual true, unconditionally loving nature."},{"segment_id":554,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"That you exist here and now is the one that is the all."},{"segment_id":555,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"And what you put out is what you get back."},{"segment_id":556,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"And those ideas never change, but

much."},{"segment_id":558,"speaker_group":207,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":559,"speaker_group":207,"source_text":"We're pretty much wrapping up
