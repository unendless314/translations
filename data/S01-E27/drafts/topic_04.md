97. We recently had in our collective consciousness-- the US government had made-- brought to the awareness-- programs of studying UFOs and not fully announcing the UFO ET presence, but sort of coming close to sort of seed the collective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. I wanted to ask how you-- from your perspective, how you guys see this energy or this news affecting...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

99. It can facilitate more of those in your world's willingness to accept this idea of extraterrestrial reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

100. Has it sped timelines up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. Or is it early?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

102. It can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. Yes, jump a little bit ahead, so to speak--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

104. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

106. --in the way that is supported, so it can still be appropriate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

107. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. Many, many people on our planet say it's not enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. They need to disclose more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

110. It has to come from within the individuals more, really.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And then they can feel more comfortable, in a sense, within what they are sharing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. They don't fully understand it themselves at this point, even though the understanding is contained within all of your DNA in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Not many of you have accessed to it yet, acknowledged its existence yet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

114. If it were to happen too fast, it would almost be counterproductive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

115. Yes, it is happening on a very organic rate in a sense, just as the seed grows into a tree that produces branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit, but then ripens in its appropriate, in a sense, organic timing in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And there are many factors involved in facilitating alignment with your civilizations, aligning in alignment with an organic unfoldment as though you're awakening to this ET reality is coming through as though it had come out of a seed and is growing, surfacing, breaking the surface of the soil, seeing the sunlight-- the light of day in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. And in a sense, that is about as far as you've gotten in this analogy, with your growth at this point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. Beginning to break the surface, the seed of a plant, the tender growth process is occurring at that level in this analogy in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

119. Well usually when we plant seeds, before it sprouts out of the ground is the longest time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. But once it starts to sprout, it comes very fast, so hopefully that's the case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

121. And in a sense, as more of you embrace this, you are like the sun giving light to this, that it may grow even faster, but all the while in its own appropriate rate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. It will not grow faster than it can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. There are times in your plant world, there are those who might try and accelerate the rate of growth of a particular plant, experimenting with it or not knowing, simply wanting to see if they can kick it into gear faster.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. And there are then those in your world who do at times and will continue to try and accelerate the rate to even try and genetically alter it in a sense to be something other than that which they might perceive it would be if it were allowed to grow into its own tree and create its own fruit in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. So there are some who would have an idea to try and genetically alter the outcome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. Again, there are many forces, factors, beings of high intelligence within the one that has the all-- that are very focused here with all that are in our interacting in this exchange of unfoldment, of these co-created realities to facilitate an alignment of how it unfolds in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. And so that what is the final and in a sense result-- the fruit is very ripe for all involved human beings on Earth, human beings in our civilization, others who facilitate this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. For there are many that are part of the one that we and you all are one with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

129. So many factors that we maybe can't quite understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. So we should just--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

131. You can open-- invite to learn more about them-- won't need to know all of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. Some will be very helpful to learn about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. Yeah, some very exciting to know about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. Some that you can, in a sense, stand beside and grow and learn from and with and share what you know, that they may learn from you as well in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

135. Well, these interactions are quite informative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. So this is one way, I suppose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

137. Certainly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
