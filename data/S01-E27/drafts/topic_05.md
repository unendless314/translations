138. You described earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. You described your civilization's physical appearance and maybe being quite similar to us humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. The human physical appearance is so wide in its spectrum from different nationalities-- Asian, African, Spanish.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. We have such a wide variety.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Is there such a variety in your civilization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

143. There is a variety potentially as wide, but generally not as wide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. But the potential is within the genetic framework.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

145. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

146. We can mirror, given the characteristics of our physiology to those in your civilization at this time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

147. Would there be a density level that we could classify Ishuwa in his--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

148. Fourth, fifth, and sixth, primarily, in interacting with your civilization at this timing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

149. OK, so for-- my understanding from that would be very close to an almost non-physical being, but still having a physicality, but close in the evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

150. Different than vibration of your physiology yes. Physical for me, all the same in my vibratory world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

151. And in that sense, you can easily adapt to our likeness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. Or other -- to adapt your physicality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. Is that sort of when you say you are mirroring?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

154. There are those who are similar in physical characteristics in our world to those in your world, mirroring in that sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. So those from Asia-- we have some in our world similar to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. They would then mirror one another in that respect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. If they were in the presence of one another, they would mirror one another in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

158. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

159. There are those in your South America, in your continent of Africa, in your North America, in your European continents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. We have those in our world who would mirror those of your Earth humans in those regions as well--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

161. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

162. --that the mirroring is the idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

163. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

165. Similar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

166. We've heard a lot about the Yahyel civilization having-- or being the offspring of humans and the Zeta Reticuli beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. Is there a relationship with what humans know as Grays or Zeta beings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

168. To my civilization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

169. Yes, to the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

170. There are some of our DNA within that, that you would think of as Zeta.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Not necessarily all of them contain some of our DNA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. They have varieties as well-- hybrid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. They have moved out and have some variation as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

174. So many people have talked about interactions with their hybrid children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. And they talk in the sense of their understanding that their children are Zeta-human hybrids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

176. They can be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

177. Are there Yahyel-human hybrids?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

178. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

179. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

180. The Yahyel and the Earth humans-- one civilization that is, in a sense, being co-created from our and your collective consciousness through choice, our and your collective conscious level, super-conscious levels, choosing to co-create-- Yauaney civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

181. Yauaney.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

182. The Yauaney.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. Some Earth humans have hybrids in a sense that are Yauaney.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

184. So would that be what collectively we're starting to understand-- the hybrid children?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Would that be a name of this race?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. The Yauaney would be our--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

187. Some of them are Yauaney
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

188. Yauaney.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

189. Yauaney.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Some are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. Not all are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. There are then Earth humans who have connections to extraterrestrials from other civilizations, interacting with them in various ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. And then they can have created some hybrid children with those extraterrestrial civilizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. So we are not the only one interacting with Earth humans at this time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

195. Not just Zetas, not just Yahyel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. But we have Pleiadians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. We have Dracos.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. We have Arcturians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. We have a whole big cosmic family and lots of offspring from that at some point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

200. Family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

201. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

202. Galactic family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Yes, a variety of hybrid children are a part of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

204. Do these children play together-- different races, different offsprings from different cosmic--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

205. This can and does occur.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

206. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. Does it--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

208. Not to say that they are all aware of one another necessarily.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

209. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
