59. A few more questions in regard to this.
→ {"text": "關於這個，我還有幾個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. For when-- for interacting with other civilizations, do you also-- do they also have the same type of channeling mechanisms that we are using in this case and other-- specifically my series that I'm doing here is utilizing the channeling mechanism or techniques.
→ {"text": "當你與其他文明互動時，他們是否也使用和我們現在一樣的通靈機制？特別是我正在進行的這個系列，就是運用通靈機制或技術。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文句法略有停頓和重複，已修正為流暢中文"}


## Speaker Group 10

61. Some other civilizations do this, yes.
→ {"text": "是的，有些其他文明也這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. It is part, in a sense, of human biological ability.
→ {"text": "在某種意義上，這是人類生物能力的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. There are different ways that the channeling can be done than what you are most familiar with experiencing.
→ {"text": "通靈可以用不同的方式進行，不只是你們最熟悉的那種體驗方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. But those will be more evident in time as those types of channeling capacities unveil themselves in your world's experiencing of them.
→ {"text": "但隨著時間推移，當這些類型的通靈能力在你們世界的體驗中逐漸揭示自己，它們會變得更加明顯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. There are then other civilizations that simply choose not to interact in that capacity.
→ {"text": "也有一些文明單純選擇不以這種方式進行互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

66. What would be-- if it's OK to share, what would be some of the other capacities?
→ {"text": "如果可以分享的話，其他的方式有哪些呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

67. Some do not speak at all.
→ {"text": "有些文明完全不說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Some are entirely, let's say, telepathic in a sense.
→ {"text": "有些可以說是完全以心電感應的方式溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. Some do not do that at all.
→ {"text": "有些則完全不這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. Some are very vocal.
→ {"text": "有些非常善於發聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. They are very behavioral in their communication.
→ {"text": "他們的溝通非常依賴行為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. It is then to learn what their behavior is communicating in a sense.
→ {"text": "所以需要學習去理解他們的行為在傳達什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. That then is a very different type of communication.
→ {"text": "那是一種非常不同的溝通方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. It isn't necessarily as specific as words in telepathic communication can be.
→ {"text": "它不像心電感應溝通中的文字那樣明確具體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. In those types of transactions, interactions, communications with those behavioral communicators-- it can-- at first, interactions seem that the information is very vague.
→ {"text": "在與這些行為溝通者的交流、互動、溝通中——起初，互動可能會感覺資訊非常模糊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. Not much one can learn from that type of interaction.
→ {"text": "似乎無法從這類互動中學到太多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. However, giving it time, behavioral communication can be a little bit like those in your world who do sign language.
→ {"text": "然而，給它一些時間，行為溝通會有點像你們世界裡使用手語的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And so it can get to be very useful, very meaningful, very fulfilling in levels of great depth, and detail, and interlayerment in a sense.
→ {"text": "所以它可以變得非常有用、非常有意義、非常充實，達到很深的層次、很細緻的細節，以及多層次的交織。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. And so that is another type of communication where channeling isn't really taking place-- behavioral communication.
→ {"text": "所以這是另一種溝通方式，並不涉及通靈——也就是行為溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "你們文明與其他文明之間有沒有使用任何裝置來溝通？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. Or is it more biological?
