59. A few more questions in regard to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. For when-- for interacting with other civilizations, do you also-- do they also have the same type of channeling mechanisms that we are using in this case and other-- specifically my series that I'm doing here is utilizing the channeling mechanism or techniques.

## Speaker Group 10

61. Some other civilizations do this, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. It is part, in a sense, of human biological ability.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. There are different ways that the channeling can be done than what you are most familiar with experiencing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. But those will be more evident in time as those types of channeling capacities unveil themselves in your world's experiencing of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. There are then other civilizations that simply choose not to interact in that capacity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

66. What would be-- if it's OK to share, what would be some of the other capacities?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

67. Some do not speak at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Some are entirely, let's say, telepathic in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. Some do not do that at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. Some are very vocal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. They are very behavioral in their communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. It is then to learn what their behavior is communicating in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. That then is a very different type of communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. It isn't necessarily as specific as words in telepathic communication can be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. In those types of transactions, interactions, communications with those behavioral communicators-- it can-- at first, interactions seem that the information is very vague.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. Not much one can learn from that type of interaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. However, giving it time, behavioral communication can be a little bit like those in your world who do sign language.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. And so it can get to be very useful, very meaningful, very fulfilling in levels of great depth, and detail, and interlayerment in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. And so that is another type of communication where channeling isn't really taking place-- behavioral communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

80. Almost like how we interact with some animal species--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

81. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

82. --on our planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

83. And there are then-- many of your animals do more of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

84. Specific, like dolphins and apes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. And some people have telepathic communication with these animals, but--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

86. They can with themselves as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

87. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. Is there any sort of technology, how we understand in our world with electronics, AI, and gadgets?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Is there any kind of gadget communication with other civilizations through your civilization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Or is it more biological?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

94. We do have some artificial constructs that in that sense convey communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

96. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
