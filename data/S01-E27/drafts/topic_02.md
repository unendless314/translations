19. Wonderful to be here with you in these blending moments to God, to have this opportunity to explore more of the infinite that we all are, more of the unconditional love that is all of our actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. And with this in heart and mind, in what way would you most enjoy exploring together?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

21. Oh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. Hi, Ishuwa.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. I'd like to ask a few questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

24. Very well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

25. First of all, I'd like to know a little bit more about yourself and your civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

26. Very well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. I am Ishuwa--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

28. Yes.

## Speaker Group 8

29. --of the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. The idea, then, in brief brevity-- your and our civilization were at one time the same one civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. There were some in our world who chose to step out into space to explore new worlds, new creations, new evolutions, hybridizations of life forms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. And some of those who embarked on that co-creation from our civilization-- they, over eons and eons of your time in a sense, through the blending, through the hybridization through the evolving with other civilizations some quite different than ours but human, yes... ...have evolved and become your earth human civilization so you do, as the channel was mentioning earlier, you do each of you on Earth in the DNA of your human biology
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. all of you without exception born here on Earth have DNA that is then very much that of our civilization. The one in which you in a sense were part of before the time of stepping out into space to explore, to create new hybrid worlds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. So in that sense we are family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. We are human as you are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. There are variations in our physical appearance from those of you on your world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. We could walk amongst you and the variations wouldn't make you think necessarily we were from another world, perhaps just from a different part of your world you aren't familiar with in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. We are very different in our vibration, our consciousness, our sense of who we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. Our knowingness of existence is quite different than that you have in your world at this timing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. We all know in that sense who we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. We all support one another in all moments without hesitation, without question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. We are then supported by ourself and by all others in our civilization at all times without hesitation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. This is a wonderful-- a wonderment, a wondrous experience for us to be a part of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. This simply is the way we have chosen to co-create our experience together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. So it is no less or greater than that in your world's choices to choose as you have been doing, to be somewhat separate from the awareness of your actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. So the idea then-- I have been exploring and traveling through what you might think of as timelines, what you might think of as for a very long time in terms of how you perceive years in past, present, and future.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. But it isn't all that long in my experiencing, for I am able, as many of us are, to move about in time-- past, present, and future at rates that don't then take as long as you might think they would.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. And in doing this type of exploration, it allows me to experience extraterrestrial civilizations from a variety of choices in terms of who they choose to be as individuals, as a society, how they choose to interact with other civilizations in their own worlds and on other planets, in other solar systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. This, then, for me is a great joy to explore, and experience, and learn from other civilizations, other extraterrestrial beings, other worlds, other ways of life, other forms of experiencing the infinite, that we all are, unconditional love, that we all are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. This is of great excitement and fulfillment for me to do this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. I, in doing this, have developed the type of translation ability that affords me the ability then to speak with a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations in a language they can understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. It is as though I am a translator in a sense for several extraterrestrial worlds, civilizations, beings, life forms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. These are some, then, of the activities and functions for me that are fulfilling, that are a part of who I enjoy experiencing and sharing with others in other worlds and in my own Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. It is always a great joy to have opportunity to interact in that, then in your civilization to share and interact with those of your human experience in your current timeline, which is always changing in every moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. There's a great joy for me to be able to interact with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. So that is a little about me and the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. Did you have more around that-- you wanted to ask about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Or was there another direction you would like to explore?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
