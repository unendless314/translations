## Speaker Group 2

19. Wonderful to be here with you in these blending moments to God, to have this opportunity to explore more of the infinite that we all are, more of the unconditional love that is all of our actual nature.
→ {"text": "很高興能在這融合的時刻與你們同在，有這個機會一起探索更多我們共同本質的無限性，探索那無條件的愛——我們所有人的真實本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 3

→ {"text": "你好，伊舒瓦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 8

29. --of the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "——來自亞耶爾文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. The idea, then, in brief brevity-- your and our civilization were at one time the same one civilization.
→ {"text": "簡單來說——你們的文明和我們的文明，曾經是同一個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. There were some in our world who chose to step out into space to explore new worlds, new creations, new evolutions, hybridizations of life forms.
→ {"text": "我們世界中有一些人選擇踏入太空，去探索新的世界、新的創造、新的進化，以及生命形式的混種實驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. And some of those who embarked on that co-creation from our civilization-- they, over eons and eons of your time in a sense, through the blending, through the hybridization through the evolving with other civilizations some quite different than ours but human, yes... ...have evolved and become your earth human civilization so you do, as the channel was mentioning earlier, you do each of you on Earth in the DNA of your human biology
→ {"text": "而那些從我們文明出發、踏上共同創造之旅的人——他們在漫長的時間中，以你們的時間感來說是千萬億年，透過融合、透過混血、透過與其他文明的演化——有些文明與我們截然不同但仍屬人類——最終演化成為你們地球人類文明。所以，正如通靈者稍早提到的，你們每個人在地球上的人類生物學 DNA 中……", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文句法不完整，已依語境修正連貫性"}

33. all of you without exception born here on Earth have DNA that is then very much that of our civilization. The one in which you in a sense were part of before the time of stepping out into space to explore, to create new hybrid worlds.
→ {"text": "……所有在地球上出生的人，無一例外，都擁有我們文明的 DNA。也就是在踏入太空探索、創造新的混種世界之前，你們在某種意義上曾是其中一部分的那個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. So in that sense we are family.
→ {"text": "所以在這個意義上，我們是家人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. We are human as you are.
→ {"text": "我們和你們一樣都是人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. There are variations in our physical appearance from those of you on your world.
→ {"text": "我們的物質外觀與你們世界上的人有些差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. We could walk amongst you and the variations wouldn't make you think necessarily we were from another world, perhaps just from a different part of your world you aren't familiar with in that way.
→ {"text": "但我們可以走在你們之中，這些差異不見得會讓你們認為我們來自另一個世界，也許只會以為我們來自你們世界上某個你們不熟悉的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. We are very different in our vibration, our consciousness, our sense of who we are.
→ {"text": "但我們在頻率、在意識、在對自我的認知上，與你們截然不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. Our knowingness of existence is quite different than that you have in your world at this timing.
→ {"text": "我們對造物者的認知，與你們世界在此刻所擁有的認知非常不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. We all know in that sense who we are.
→ {"text": "在這個意義上，我們都知道自己是誰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. We all support one another in all moments without hesitation, without question.
→ {"text": "我們在每個時刻都毫不猶豫、毫無疑問地互相支持。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. We are then supported by ourself and by all others in our civilization at all times without hesitation.
→ {"text": "我們在任何時候都毫無保留地得到自己以及文明中所有其他人的支持。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. This is a wonderful-- a wonderment, a wondrous experience for us to be a part of.
→ {"text": "這是一種美好的——一種驚奇的、奇妙的體驗，能夠成為其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. This simply is the way we have chosen to co-create our experience together.
→ {"text": "這就是我們選擇共同創造體驗的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. So it is no less or greater than that in your world's choices to choose as you have been doing, to be somewhat separate from the awareness of your actual nature.
→ {"text": "所以這並不比你們世界所做的選擇更高或更低——你們選擇在某種程度上與自身真實本質的覺知保持分離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. So the idea then-- I have been exploring and traveling through what you might think of as timelines, what you might think of as for a very long time in terms of how you perceive years in past, present, and future.
→ {"text": "所以，回到我剛才說的——我已經探索並穿越了你們所理解的時間線，以你們對過去、現在、未來的年份感知來說，這已經持續了很長的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. But it isn't all that long in my experiencing, for I am able, as many of us are, to move about in time-- past, present, and future at rates that don't then take as long as you might think they would.
→ {"text": "但在我的體驗中並沒有那麼久，因為我能夠——就像我們許多人一樣——以不同的速率在時間中移動，穿梭於過去、現在和未來，所需的時間並不像你們想像的那麼長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. And in doing this type of exploration, it allows me to experience extraterrestrial civilizations from a variety of choices in terms of who they choose to be as individuals, as a society, how they choose to interact with other civilizations in their own worlds and on other planets, in other solar systems.
→ {"text": "在進行這類探索的過程中，我得以體驗各種外星文明——他們選擇成為什麼樣的個體、什麼樣的社會，他們如何選擇與自己世界以及其他星球、其他太陽系中的其他文明互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. This, then, for me is a great joy to explore, and experience, and learn from other civilizations, other extraterrestrial beings, other worlds, other ways of life, other forms of experiencing the infinite, that we all are, unconditional love, that we all are.
→ {"text": "對我而言，探索、體驗並學習其他文明、其他外星存有、其他世界、其他生活方式，以及體驗我們共同本質的不同形式——也就是那無條件的愛，是莫大的喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. This is of great excitement and fulfillment for me to do this.
→ {"text": "做這些事對我來說充滿了興奮與滿足。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. I, in doing this, have developed the type of translation ability that affords me the ability then to speak with a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations in a language they can understand.
→ {"text": "在這個過程中，我發展出一種翻譯能力，使我能夠以各種外星文明都能理解的語言與他們交流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. It is as though I am a translator in a sense for several extraterrestrial worlds, civilizations, beings, life forms.
→ {"text": "可以說，我在某種意義上是多個外星世界、文明、存有、生命形式的翻譯者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. These are some, then, of the activities and functions for me that are fulfilling, that are a part of who I enjoy experiencing and sharing with others in other worlds and in my own Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "這些便是對我而言充滿意義的活動與職能，是我樂於體驗並與其他世界以及我自己的亞耶爾文明分享的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. It is always a great joy to have opportunity to interact in that, then in your civilization to share and interact with those of your human experience in your current timeline, which is always changing in every moment.
→ {"text": "能夠有機會這樣互動，在你們的文明中與那些處於你們當前時間線中的人類分享並交流，這對我而言始終是莫大的喜悅——而你們的時間線每一刻都在變化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. There's a great joy for me to be able to interact with you.
→ {"text": "能夠與你們互動，對我來說是很大的喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. So that is a little about me and the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "以上就是關於我和亞耶爾文明的一些介紹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. Did you have more around that-- you wanted to ask about?
→ {"text": "關於這個，你還有更多想問的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. Or was there another direction you would like to explore?
→ {"text": "或者你想探索其他的方向？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
