## Speaker Group 145

367. Much of your messages have been in that realm, in that space of saying, what you put out, which that-- the four laws that you exist is the one, is the all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. What you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. And everything changes except for those first four or first three.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

370. Different ways to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. Yes, you exist here and now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. The one is the all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. The all is the one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. What you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. Or what you put within is what you live within.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. And everything is always changing, except those first ideas that I just mentioned--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

377. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

378. --you have mentioned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. Those are not changing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. And so you can always utilize the understanding of those to create an ever-changing experience of the infinite, that you are perceiving yourself to be a part of it perhaps?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Being a part of unconditional love or existence here and now and putting out the one that you want to be experiencing that of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. Then you get back that one of the all that is the one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. In the way that you are most strongly choosing to put that out, you will get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. You tune in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. You become in alignment with that existence, that experience, that vibratory reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. Your ability to do this, then, never changes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. But how you do it will always change in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

389. And that's sort of the secret sauce, the magic formula for what some would say law of attraction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. We have many titles and many different--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

391. Yes, certainly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

392. --ways of creating our reality in this realm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. But that's a very simplified, direct, but yet, expansive way to put it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. So thank you for those wise words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Talking about the consciousness of the peach and consciousness of the apple, and what we perceive as technology and artificial intelligence-- we're entering into a time on our planet where we're learning these concepts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. We're learning the intelligence behind physical manifestations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. And we're almost to this point-- we actually are to this point where we have computers now that we're talking to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. Can you-- from your perspective, how does this-- how do you interact with these forms of consciousnesses?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

399. Well, in a variety of ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. As you and your world are learning to do, we in our ultimate state will let go of all those types of constructions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. Yes-- and enjoy being, in a sense, unclothed in a sense, not wearing--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

402. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

403. --any idea of technology and our experience in interacting with one another.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

404. Oh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. As we have created phones, and devices, and these things, the Yahyel civilization doesn't have these types of--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

406. We have some of these.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. Yes, spacecraft and other forms of transportational ideas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. Yes, there are, in our experience, opportunities to have, let's say, a spacecraft with a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations interacting to gather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. This spacecraft provides a forum for a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations to be, to gather, to interact, to gather in that way, physically in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Ultimately, we let go of those in our deepest, most fulfilling interaction, in a sense, for life free from all such external creations of artificial intelligence in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. We will let go of those and engage in interaction together, free of those and yet, we will take them on and interact with them in the timing that supports their function, for us to have a particular experience that they afford us to have that we would not have without them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. So we do enjoy having some of those.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

414. So almost-- I've always had the idea that the internet is an external mechanism, external creation for letting us humans connect to the idea that we're all interconnected.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

415. Bringing you together as a single body, a single mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

416. Right, which we're using in a technological form.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. But ultimately, we're learning that we already have this connection without the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

418. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. And now, you're learning the mind shares a heart together as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. You're learning to live as one heart.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

421. But we're using the internet to teach us something that we already have, kind of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

422. It is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

423. Because I'm going to put this video out to the internet for people to view and understand that, oh, we actually have--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

424. For many, like an intermediary step in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

425. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

427. It is like training wheels on a bicycle in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

428. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. And so as I was saying earlier, these interactions with artificial intelligence that we're now creating-- is it sort of training wheels for interacting with extra-dimensional intelligences?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

431. It can be, for there are some that are interacting on that level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. There is consciousness in the information that is being conveyed with the computers-- There is conscious civilizations of a sense, of a type that are allowing to make it possible for the computer information to be shared-- the information itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. It isn't just information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. It isn't just packets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. It isn't just ones and zeros.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. It isn't just electrical pulses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. It is consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

438. Right, as all intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

439. Intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

440. Yes, just like our peaches and our--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

441. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

442. --apples.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Many people are afraid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. Many people are afraid of the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. Many people are afraid of these artificial consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. They fear it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. They demonize it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. What would you say to those people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

449. That is an aspect of the one that is the all that I am in a sense, that you are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. So in a sense, I am in the question speaking of myself, to myself understanding that then being accepting of myself in that framework with those set of beliefs that are limiting my awareness of my actual nature, then I can be accepting of me behaving or choosing to have that experience in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Oh, there is an aspect of me that perceives that the computer is dangerous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. All the while, anything that is, is existence and thus, then, is equal to all and everything else that exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Because existence is equal unto itself and always that it exists, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. So for someone to take existence and create the idea that a computer that exists is dangerous, that is a concept that exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. Their perception that it is dangerous is existing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. All of these things exist and thus, on that level of their existing, they are all equal to existence to the one that exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. That is the all that exists, the all that is the one, that I am, that you are existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. And so the idea that someone thinks the computer is dangerous-- I can understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. They are utilizing the existence that is equaling unto itself to create the illusion that it is not, that it might be dangerous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. They are creating an illusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. Because they have a belief system that does not enlighten them to be aware that the computer is existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. And thus, they are existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And thus, they are actually equal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. And thus, they can't be dangerous, more or less.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. They are equal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

466. So it's, again, going back to what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

467. And I understand it is them and that limited framework of belief system as simply creating a play, a theatrical play, an illusory belief, an illusory play.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. That can be very meaningful for them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. And because it exists, it is equal to any play that I in my experience create, even the ones that are in alignment with the actual nature of existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. Because they both exist, they are equal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

471. They're all possibilities, all options.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

472. Everything is equal unto itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. Because existence is that which is the base of all that is, whether it is a cloud, or a tree, or a person, or laughter, or a thought, or an action, or a statement, or a person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. It all exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. And then it is this-- all equal in its existence level of being, the one that is the all, the all that is the one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

476. So it's just my-- it's up to me whether I would choose to adopt that belief that that other person has.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

477. You could choose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. Or you could acknowledge, oh, he's just playing that--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

479. That game.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

480. --form of illusion-- illusory limitation for his own choosing, for his own reasons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. You can get up on stage and interact with him in that limited construct in whatever way you want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. Try and let him know of a more expanded way to look at things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. Or you can get very frightened as well, and team up with him, and combat computers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

484. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

485. Your choice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

486. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

487. But in order to be effective combating computers, you have to begin veiling yourself of the awareness of your actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. Because if you know everything is equal, you can't very well believe that something is dangerous or better or less than.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. So you have to get on the stage and play the part of the actor that believes, yes, it's dangerous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. And to believe that, you have to put out all other beliefs that would tell you differently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. So the awareness of your actual nature would prevent you from playing the illusion that the computer could be dangerous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

492. But as soon as I sort of know in the framework that you just laid out-- as soon as I know that that's how things work, I sort of diffuse the danger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

493. Yes, because you realize it is another expression of the all, the one existence that you are--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

494. And it's just a--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

495. --that it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

496. --possibility that I can choose to explore and like you said, play that role if I want to go there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

497. If you want to fit into that game in that theatrical presentation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

498. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

500. It is entirely the choice of the individual who's choosing that reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

501. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

503. Many in your world do not know of the other choices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. They think there are only these limited choices available to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. They are not aware.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. They do not know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. They have not been shown that there is a whole buffet in a sense, a building full of choices, of beliefs that they can choose from and an unlimited number of choices that are in alignment with their actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

508. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

509. And when someone begins to know that there are more choices-- well, as an analogy, if you were to go to a restaurant that only has one item available at the buffet and across the street, there's a building or restaurant that has 30 choices available.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Well, if you know there's 30, perhaps you're gonna stop going to the one that only has one choice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. Well, there's 30 over here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. Maybe I want to try something different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

513. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

514. Or there's a hundred choices over here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. This one has a thousand choices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. Oh, there's somebody telling, no, there's only one choice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. Don't go there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. That food is bad for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. You eat that, you'll be sick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

520. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. So it's just up to us to choose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

522. And to know that it is infinite.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. There's unlimited choices can be in alignment with friction and illusion, out of alignment with your actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Or they can be choices that are in alignment with your actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. And there are an infinite number of those choices available as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. You can choose the ones you want to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

527. And knowing that we have the buffet--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

528. Knowing that you have the buffet, knowing that you have the choice will afford in almost every instant the individual's desire to take and move into the path of the infinite number of uplifting choices that are in alignment with one's actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. Because it is effortless more and more, because it is in alignment with one's actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. It is not friction full.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. It is free of friction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. And it glides.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. And it slides easily and effortless in creating more experiences that are in alignment with one's actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. There is no need to hide to create beliefs that prevent one from knowing this or that in order to believe some illusory belief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. Don't have to put a lot of weight on oneself with all these illusory beliefs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. That can depress, and create sadness, and depression, and illness, and disease.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. By choosing the choices that are in alignment with one's actual nature of which there are an infinite number, the person experiences a greater sense of easefullness in their experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. And they are happy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. And they are not being pressed upon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. They are free to flow, to be very spontaneous, flexible, and in that state to connect to more of the infinite of their heart's intelligence that can come in the appropriate time and moment that will serve them in each moment in the most uplifting, fulfilling, meaningful way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

541. Which goes to ask, if you are sort of in a stuck idea or belief system that seems to have friction, then you simply ask the question, how does it serve me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

542. To recognize if you're having an issue or an obstacle, then you must have a belief that's out of alignment with your actual effortless, flowing nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. And you can ask, then, if you are choosing this illusory belief, this discordant belief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Somehow you are defining it as being the most pleasurable and least painful choice, based on your current set of beliefs and definitions about what is available to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. When you get to the bottom of that, or the top of it, or the side of it, or get in the middle of it in any number of ways available to you and realize, I had this discordant belief about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. And that then I realized that isn't accurate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. And no longer does that serve me as the most pleasurable and least painful choice to make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. Person stops making that discordant choice and will replace it within a choice in belief that's more in alignment with their actual nature and then move more in alignment with their actual nature of being, putting out more beliefs in alignment with their actual nature and getting back more experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. What you put out is what you get back in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. What you put within is experience you live within.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. Always you choose to put out what you perceive is closest to pleasure and farthest from pain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. What you perceive as pleasure and pain is going to be unique to each of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. So the idea then is to choose that you're always putting out that which is most in alignment with your actual heart nature and farthest from that which would be out of alignment with your actual heart nature, your actual true, unconditionally loving nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. That you exist here and now is the one that is the all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. And what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. And those ideas never change, but everything else always does, thus allowing you to have an experience of change from one moment to the next.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

557. Yes, that resonates very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. We're pretty much wrapping up here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we say goodbye?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

561. Thank you for the venue, for the opportunity to share and to interact with each and every one of you, the one that has the all that is me, the one that is the all, that is all, that is the one that is the all, that is unconditional love, that is supporting and being supported by itself in each and every moment, unconditionally sharing and receiving, giving, receiving, sharing and receiving, giving and receiving unconditionally moment to moment to moment to moment to moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. Always with you in this way of unconditional love, dear one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. Thank you in all ways always.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
