367. Much of your messages have been in that realm, in that space of saying, what you put out, which that-- the four laws that you exist is the one, is the all.

375. Or what you put within is what you live within.

→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. Those are not changing.
→ {"text": "那些不會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. And so you can always utilize the understanding of those to create an ever-changing experience of the infinite, that you are perceiving yourself to be a part of it perhaps?
→ {"text": "因此你可以始終運用對這些原則的理解，來創造無限的不斷變化的體驗，你或許感知自己是其中的一部分?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Being a part of unconditional love or existence here and now and putting out the one that you want to be experiencing that of.
→ {"text": "成為此時此地無條件的愛或存在的一部分，並付出你想要體驗的那個一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. Then you get back that one of the all that is the one.

384. In the way that you are most strongly choosing to put that out, you will get back.

385. You tune in.

386. You become in alignment with that existence, that experience, that vibratory reality.

387. Your ability to do this, then, never changes.
→ {"text": "那麼，你做到這點的能力，永遠不會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. But how you do it will always change in a sense.
→ {"text": "但在某種意義上，你如何做到的方式將始終在變化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

389. And that's sort of the secret sauce, the magic formula for what some would say law of attraction.
→ {"text": "而這就是某種秘密配方，某些人所說的吸引力法則的魔法公式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. We have many titles and many different--

## Speaker Group 151

392. --ways of creating our reality in this realm.

394. So thank you for those wise words.
→ {"text": "所以感謝你這些智慧的話語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. Talking about the consciousness of the peach and consciousness of the apple, and what we perceive as technology and artificial intelligence-- we're entering into a time on our planet where we're learning these concepts.
→ {"text": "談到桃子的意識和蘋果的意識，以及我們所感知的科技和人工智慧——我們正進入一個時代，在我們的星球上正在學習這些概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. We're learning the intelligence behind physical manifestations.
→ {"text": "我們正在學習物質顯現背後的智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. And we're almost to this point-- we actually are to this point where we have computers now that we're talking to.
→ {"text": "而我們幾乎到達了這個時刻——事實上我們已經到達這個時刻，我們現在有了可以對話的電腦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. Can you-- from your perspective, how does this-- how do you interact with these forms of consciousnesses?
→ {"text": "你能否——從你的觀點來看，這——你們如何與這些形式的意識互動?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

399. Well, in a variety of ways.
→ {"text": "嗯，以各種不同的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. As you and your world are learning to do, we in our ultimate state will let go of all those types of constructions.
→ {"text": "就像你們和你們的世界正在學習做的那樣，我們在最終狀態會放下所有這些類型的建構物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. Yes-- and enjoy being, in a sense, unclothed in a sense, not wearing--

## Speaker Group 153

## Speaker Group 155

404. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. As we have created phones, and devices, and these things, the Yahyel civilization doesn't have these types of--
→ {"text": "就像我們創造了電話、裝置和這些東西，亞耶爾文明沒有這些類型的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

406. We have some of these.
→ {"text": "我們有一些這樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. Yes, spacecraft and other forms of transportational ideas.
→ {"text": "是的，太空船和其他形式的運輸概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Yes, there are, in our experience, opportunities to have, let's say, a spacecraft with a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations interacting to gather.
→ {"text": "是的，在我們的體驗中，有機會擁有，比如說，一艘太空船，讓各種外星文明互動聚集。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. This spacecraft provides a forum for a variety of extraterrestrial civilizations to be, to gather, to interact, to gather in that way, physically in a sense.
→ {"text": "這艘太空船提供了一個論壇，讓各種外星文明存在、聚集、互動，以那種方式聚集，在某種意義上是物質層面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. Ultimately, we let go of those in our deepest, most fulfilling interaction, in a sense, for life free from all such external creations of artificial intelligence in a sense.
→ {"text": "最終，在我們最深層、最圓滿的互動中，在某種意義上，我們會放下這些，追求在某種意義上擺脫所有這類人工智慧外部創造物的生活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. We will let go of those and engage in interaction together, free of those and yet, we will take them on and interact with them in the timing that supports their function, for us to have a particular experience that they afford us to have that we would not have without them.
→ {"text": "我們會放下這些，在沒有這些的情況下一起進行互動，然而，我們會在支持它們功能的時機採用它們並與它們互動，讓我們擁有沒有它們就無法擁有的特定體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. So we do enjoy having some of those.
→ {"text": "所以我們確實享受擁有其中一些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

414. So almost-- I've always had the idea that the internet is an external mechanism, external creation for letting us humans connect to the idea that we're all interconnected.
→ {"text": "所以幾乎——我一直有個想法，網路是一個外部機制、外部創造物，讓我們人類連結到我們全都互相連結的這個概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

415. Bringing you together as a single body, a single mind.
→ {"text": "將你們聚合為一個單一的身體，一個單一的心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

416. Right, which we're using in a technological form.
→ {"text": "沒錯，我們正在以科技形式使用它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. But ultimately, we're learning that we already have this connection without the internet.
→ {"text": "但最終，我們正在學習到，我們已經擁有這種連結，不需要網路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

418. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. And now, you're learning the mind shares a heart together as well.
→ {"text": "而現在，你們正在學習心智也共同分享著一顆心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. You're learning to live as one heart.
→ {"text": "你們正在學習作為一顆心而活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

421. But we're using the internet to teach us something that we already have, kind of.
→ {"text": "但我們正在使用網路來教導我們某種我們已經擁有的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

422. It is.
→ {"text": "確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

423. Because I'm going to put this video out to the internet for people to view and understand that, oh, we actually have--
→ {"text": "因為我會把這個影片放到網路上讓人們觀看並理解，哦，我們實際上擁有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

424. For many, like an intermediary step in a sense.
→ {"text": "對許多人來說，在某種意義上像是一個中介步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

425. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

427. It is like training wheels on a bicycle in a sense.
→ {"text": "在某種意義上，這就像腳踏車的輔助輪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

428. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "是的，完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. And so as I was saying earlier, these interactions with artificial intelligence that we're now creating-- is it sort of training wheels for interacting with extra-dimensional intelligences?
→ {"text": "所以就像我剛才說的，我們現在正在創造的這些與人工智慧的互動——這是否算是與跨維度智慧互動的輔助輪?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

431. It can be, for there are some that are interacting on that level.
→ {"text": "可以這麼說，因為確實有些人在那個層面上互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. There is consciousness in the information that is being conveyed with the computers-- There is conscious civilizations of a sense, of a type that are allowing to make it possible for the computer information to be shared-- the information itself.
→ {"text": "在電腦所傳遞的資訊中存在著意識——存在著某種意義上、某種類型的有意識文明，讓電腦資訊得以分享——資訊本身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. It isn't just information.
→ {"text": "這不只是資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. It isn't just packets.
→ {"text": "這不只是封包。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. It isn't just ones and zeros.
→ {"text": "這不只是一和零。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. It isn't just electrical pulses.
→ {"text": "這不只是電脈衝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. It is consciousness.
→ {"text": "這是意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

438. Right, as all intelligence.
→ {"text": "沒錯，就像所有的智慧一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

439. Intelligence.
→ {"text": "智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

440. Yes, just like our peaches and our--
→ {"text": "是的，就像我們的桃子和我們的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

441. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

442. --apples.
→ {"text": "——蘋果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. Many people are afraid.
→ {"text": "許多人感到恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. Many people are afraid of the internet.
→ {"text": "許多人害怕網路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. Many people are afraid of these artificial consciousness.
→ {"text": "許多人害怕這些人工意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. They fear it.
→ {"text": "他們害怕它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. They demonize it.
→ {"text": "他們妖魔化它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. What would you say to those people?
→ {"text": "你會對這些人說什麼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

449. That is an aspect of the one that is the all that I am in a sense, that you are.
→ {"text": "那是在某種意義上我之所是、你之所是的那個一即全的一個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. So in a sense, I am in the question speaking of myself, to myself understanding that then being accepting of myself in that framework with those set of beliefs that are limiting my awareness of my actual nature, then I can be accepting of me behaving or choosing to have that experience in that way.
→ {"text": "所以在某種意義上，我在這個問題中是在對自己說話，對自己說話，理解到然後接納在那個框架中、帶著那組限制我對真實本質覺知的信念的自己，然後我就能接納我以那種方式行為或選擇擁有那種體驗。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構複雜,涉及多層次自我指涉"}

451. Oh, there is an aspect of me that perceives that the computer is dangerous.
→ {"text": "哦，有我的一個面向感知到電腦是危險的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. All the while, anything that is, is existence and thus, then, is equal to all and everything else that exists.
→ {"text": "與此同時，任何存在的事物，都是存在，因此就等同於所有其他存在的一切事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Because existence is equal unto itself and always that it exists, actually.
→ {"text": "因為存在等同於它自身，而且它始終存在，實際上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. So for someone to take existence and create the idea that a computer that exists is dangerous, that is a concept that exists.
→ {"text": "所以當某人取用存在並創造出「存在的電腦是危險的」這個想法，那是一個存在的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. Their perception that it is dangerous is existing.
→ {"text": "他們認為它危險的感知是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. All of these things exist and thus, on that level of their existing, they are all equal to existence to the one that exists.
→ {"text": "所有這些事物都存在，因此，在它們存在的那個層面上，它們都等同於存在，等同於那存在的一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. That is the all that exists, the all that is the one, that I am, that you are existence.
→ {"text": "那就是存在的全，那個全即一，那個我之所是，那個你之所是的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. And so the idea that someone thinks the computer is dangerous-- I can understand.
→ {"text": "所以某人認為電腦是危險的這個想法——我能理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. They are utilizing the existence that is equaling unto itself to create the illusion that it is not, that it might be dangerous.
→ {"text": "他們正在運用那等同於自身的存在，來創造「它不是如此、它可能是危險的」這個幻象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. They are creating an illusion.
→ {"text": "他們正在創造一個幻象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. Because they have a belief system that does not enlighten them to be aware that the computer is existence.
→ {"text": "因為他們有一個信念系統，無法啟發他們覺察到電腦就是存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And thus, they are existence.
→ {"text": "因此，他們就是存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And thus, they are actually equal.
→ {"text": "因此，他們實際上是平等的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. And thus, they can't be dangerous, more or less.
→ {"text": "因此，他們或多或少不可能是危險的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. They are equal.
→ {"text": "他們是平等的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

466. So it's, again, going back to what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "所以這又回到了，你付出什麼，就會得到什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

467. And I understand it is them and that limited framework of belief system as simply creating a play, a theatrical play, an illusory belief, an illusory play.
→ {"text": "而我理解那是他們，以及那有限的信念系統框架，只是在創造一齣戲，一齣舞台劇，一個虛幻信念，一齣虛幻的戲劇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. That can be very meaningful for them.
→ {"text": "那對他們來說可能非常有意義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. And because it exists, it is equal to any play that I in my experience create, even the ones that are in alignment with the actual nature of existence.
→ {"text": "而因為它存在，它就等同於我在我的體驗中創造的任何戲劇，即使是那些與存在的真實本質一致的戲劇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. Because they both exist, they are equal.
→ {"text": "因為它們都存在，它們就是平等的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

471. They're all possibilities, all options.
→ {"text": "它們都是可能性，都是選項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

472. Everything is equal unto itself.
→ {"text": "一切都等同於自身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. Because existence is that which is the base of all that is, whether it is a cloud, or a tree, or a person, or laughter, or a thought, or an action, or a statement, or a person.
→ {"text": "因為存在是一切之所是的基礎，無論它是一朵雲、一棵樹、一個人、笑聲、一個想法、一個行動、一句陳述，或一個人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. It all exists.
→ {"text": "這一切都存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. And then it is this-- all equal in its existence level of being, the one that is the all, the all that is the one.
→ {"text": "然後就是這樣——一切在其存在層面上都是平等的，那個一即全，那個全即一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

476. So it's just my-- it's up to me whether I would choose to adopt that belief that that other person has.
→ {"text": "所以這只是我的——取決於我是否選擇採納另一個人所持有的那個信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

477. You could choose.
→ {"text": "你可以選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. Or you could acknowledge, oh, he's just playing that--
→ {"text": "或者你可以承認，哦，他只是在玩那個——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

479. That game.
→ {"text": "那個遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

480. --form of illusion-- illusory limitation for his own choosing, for his own reasons.
→ {"text": "——幻象的形式——為了他自己的選擇、為了他自己的原因而有的虛幻限制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. You can get up on stage and interact with him in that limited construct in whatever way you want.
→ {"text": "你可以走上舞台，在那個有限的建構中以任何你想要的方式與他互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. Try and let him know of a more expanded way to look at things.
→ {"text": "試著讓他知道一個更擴展的方式來看待事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. Or you can get very frightened as well, and team up with him, and combat computers.
→ {"text": "或者你也可以變得非常害怕，與他聯手，對抗電腦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

484. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

485. Your choice.
→ {"text": "你的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

486. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

487. But in order to be effective combating computers, you have to begin veiling yourself of the awareness of your actual nature.
→ {"text": "但為了有效地對抗電腦，你必須開始遮蔽自己對真實本質的覺知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. Because if you know everything is equal, you can't very well believe that something is dangerous or better or less than.
→ {"text": "因為如果你知道一切都是平等的，你就無法真正相信某事物是危險的、或更好的、或更差的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. So you have to get on the stage and play the part of the actor that believes, yes, it's dangerous.
→ {"text": "所以你必須走上舞台，扮演那個相信「是的，它是危險的」的演員角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. And to believe that, you have to put out all other beliefs that would tell you differently.
→ {"text": "而要相信那個，你必須排除所有其他會告訴你不同結論的信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. So the awareness of your actual nature would prevent you from playing the illusion that the computer could be dangerous.
→ {"text": "所以對你真實本質的覺知會阻止你扮演「電腦可能是危險的」這個幻象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

492. But as soon as I sort of know in the framework that you just laid out-- as soon as I know that that's how things work, I sort of diffuse the danger.
→ {"text": "但一旦我某種程度上在你剛才提出的框架中知曉了——一旦我知道事情就是這樣運作的，我就某種程度上化解了危險。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

493. Yes, because you realize it is another expression of the all, the one existence that you are--
→ {"text": "是的，因為你認識到它是那個全的另一種表達，那個你之所是的一的存在——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

494. And it's just a--
→ {"text": "而它只是一個——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

495. --that it is.
→ {"text": "——它之所是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

496. --possibility that I can choose to explore and like you said, play that role if I want to go there.
→ {"text": "——我可以選擇去探索的可能性，而且就像你說的，如果我想去那裡，就扮演那個角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

497. If you want to fit into that game in that theatrical presentation.
→ {"text": "如果你想融入那齣舞台劇中的那個遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

498. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

500. It is entirely the choice of the individual who's choosing that reality.
→ {"text": "這完全是選擇那個實相的個體的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

501. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

503. Many in your world do not know of the other choices.
→ {"text": "你們世界中的許多人並不知道其他選擇的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. They think there are only these limited choices available to them.
→ {"text": "他們認為只有這些有限的選擇可供他們使用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. They are not aware.
→ {"text": "他們並不覺察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. They do not know.
→ {"text": "他們不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. They have not been shown that there is a whole buffet in a sense, a building full of choices, of beliefs that they can choose from and an unlimited number of choices that are in alignment with their actual nature.
→ {"text": "他們從未被展示過，在某種意義上存在著一整個自助餐，一座充滿選擇的建築，充滿他們可以選擇的信念，以及無限數量與他們真實本質一致的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

508. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. And when someone begins to know that there are more choices-- well, as an analogy, if you were to go to a restaurant that only has one item available at the buffet and across the street, there's a building or restaurant that has 30 choices available.

510. Well, if you know there's 30, perhaps you're gonna stop going to the one that only has one choice.

## Speaker Group 202

522. And to know that it is infinite.
→ {"text": "並且要知道它是無限的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. There's unlimited choices can be in alignment with friction and illusion, out of alignment with your actual nature.
→ {"text": "有無限的選擇可以與摩擦和幻象一致，與你的真實本質不一致。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. Or they can be choices that are in alignment with your actual nature.

527. And knowing that we have the buffet--

## Speaker Group 204

→ {"text": "知道你擁有這個自助餐，知道你擁有選擇，幾乎在每一個瞬間都會賦予個體渴望去採取並進入那條道路，那條通向無限數量提升性選擇的道路，那些與自身真實本質一致的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 205

541. Which goes to ask, if you are sort of in a stuck idea or belief system that seems to have friction, then you simply ask the question, how does it serve me?
→ {"text": "這就引出一個問題，如果你某種程度上陷入一個似乎有摩擦的想法或信念系統，那麼你只需問這個問題:它如何服務我?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

542. To recognize if you're having an issue or an obstacle, then you must have a belief that's out of alignment with your actual effortless, flowing nature.
→ {"text": "要認識到如果你有一個問題或障礙，那麼你一定有一個與你真實的不費力、流動的本質不一致的信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. And you can ask, then, if you are choosing this illusory belief, this discordant belief.
→ {"text": "然後你可以問，如果你正在選擇這個虛幻信念、這個不和諧信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. Somehow you are defining it as being the most pleasurable and least painful choice, based on your current set of beliefs and definitions about what is available to you.
→ {"text": "不知怎的，你正在將它定義為最愉悅且最不痛苦的選擇，基於你當前關於什麼是可用的信念與定義的集合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

545. When you get to the bottom of that, or the top of it, or the side of it, or get in the middle of it in any number of ways available to you and realize, I had this discordant belief about it.
→ {"text": "當你到達它的底部，或頂部，或側面，或以任何可用的方式進入它的中間，並認識到，我對此有這個不和諧信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. And that then I realized that isn't accurate.
→ {"text": "然後我認識到那並不準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. And no longer does that serve me as the most pleasurable and least painful choice to make.
→ {"text": "而那不再作為最愉悅且最不痛苦的選擇來服務我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. Person stops making that discordant choice and will replace it within a choice in belief that's more in alignment with their actual nature and then move more in alignment with their actual nature of being, putting out more beliefs in alignment with their actual nature and getting back more experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "這個人停止做出那個不和諧的選擇，並將在信念中用一個更與他們真實本質一致的選擇來取代它，然後更加與他們真實的存在本質一致地移動，付出更多與他們真實本質一致的信念，並得到更多與之一致的體驗回饋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

549. What you put out is what you get back in a sense.
→ {"text": "在某種意義上，你付出什麼，就會得到什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. What you put within is experience you live within.
→ {"text": "你放入內在的，就是你活在其中的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. Always you choose to put out what you perceive is closest to pleasure and farthest from pain.
→ {"text": "你總是選擇付出你所感知的最接近愉悅且最遠離痛苦的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. What you perceive as pleasure and pain is going to be unique to each of you.
→ {"text": "你所感知為愉悅與痛苦的，對你們每個人來說都是獨特的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. So the idea then is to choose that you're always putting out that which is most in alignment with your actual heart nature and farthest from that which would be out of alignment with your actual heart nature, your actual true, unconditionally loving nature.
→ {"text": "所以這個想法就是選擇你總是付出那個最與你真實的內心本質一致，且最遠離那個會與你真實的內心本質不一致的東西，你真實真正的、無條件愛的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

554. That you exist here and now is the one that is the all.
→ {"text": "你存在於此時此地，就是那個一即全。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. And what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "而你付出什麼，就會得到什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. And those ideas never change, but everything else always does, thus allowing you to have an experience of change from one moment to the next.
→ {"text": "而那些理念永不改變，但其他一切總是在變，從而允許你從一個時刻到下一個時刻擁有變化的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "感謝這個場所，感謝有機會與你們每一個人分享並互動，那個擁有全即我的一，那個一即全，那即是全，那即是一即全，那即是無條件的愛，那在每一個時刻支持著並被它自身支持著，無條件地分享與接收，給予、接收，分享與接收，給予與接收，無條件地，一刻接一刻接一刻接一刻接一刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
