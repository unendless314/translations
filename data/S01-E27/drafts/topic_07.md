## Speaker Group 99

261. How would you describe, from your perspective, the angelic realms that we consider on our Earth plane?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

262. They are non-physical beings that support Earth humans in your life here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. They can be thought of as angelic beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. There are extraterrestrials who are in the physical form who support Earth Humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. And Earth humans might not be aware of this coming from physical extraterrestrials who might then define their experience and communications as coming from angels or spirit guides.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. So an extraterrestrial could be for someone on Earth, thought of as an angel or a spirit guide, even though they are physical, all the while then being some angels and spirit guides for an Earth human's experience are non-physical consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. So it comes down to, then, which a person is connecting to, to decide or determine, is it a non-physical or a physical being that they are defining or experiencing as an angel, or a spirit guide, or communication with extraterrestrial?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

268. And in your realm where you exist, do you work with-- I'm assuming you work as we do with a lot of these non-physical energies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

269. Yes, there are a variety of non-physical consciousnesses that support the matrix in a sense, the physical experience, the experience of physicality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. There are a variety of consciousnesses interacting that allow for the way we and you are experiencing physicality, that which holds what you experience as time and space in a sense, in a physical spectrum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. There are consciousnesses that are involved in this that have evolved to be more focused at doing that, that are in a sense, born to do that, in a sense, gifted at doing that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. It is their joy in a sense to be that support to live life, almost as if they are the substance that holds the physical experience of your life together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

273. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

274. Conscious being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. So even, for example, a peach or an apple-- physical item you experience contains some of these conscious beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

276. And this goes back to what Shaun and I were talking about earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. When we consume these consciousnesses, we're putting in what-- what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

278. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. Now, what you put in, what you put out is what you get back or live within.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

280. So having awareness of what types of consciousness we consume can help us in our external reality?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

281. Yes, it is conscious energies and entities, beings, lifeforms that you are consuming in the food that you are consuming or the chemistry that you are consuming that is interblended with some of the foods or many of the foods that are constructed at this time that many people on Earth are eating, construction of synthetic and chemical consciousnesses with other types of organic consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

282. And I'm assuming the constructor-- the cook, the preparer of these foods also puts in their own consciousnesses in the mix.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. And then it becomes--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

284. Certainly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

286. --a consciousness soup--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

288. --and can become quite tasty if you have a good one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

289. Very much so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

290. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. So what we're enjoying is not just the taste, but we're also enjoying all the other different consciousnesses that are-- go into that making of this wonderful creation we call like an apple pie or--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

292. That can play a part in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

294. Wonderful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Many of these civilizations have talked about a council of worlds, a sort of federation, a galactic federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. There's many titles for this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. Are you part of...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

298. We interact with those of extraterrestrial origin that, in that way, choose to come together and interact spontaneously to gather enjoyably, supportively to gather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. When one is no longer in a moment of joy, they will become focused on another venture or activity that is more exciting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. And they will move along.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. They may come back at another time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. In this way, it is always an interaction of very positive communication and support.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. We can give it names.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. But it is free from friction and conflict that is imbued or envisoned in your televisions and that which is in the pan of vision of the theater and theatrical movie releases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

305. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. We sort of formulate our version of that idea and then--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

307. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

308. --put it into a context that we can understand--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

309. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

310. --in our specific timeline evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

311. So our interaction is friction free in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. We are not fighting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. We are not trying to commandeer some other civilization's desires and wishes to supplant our own.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. There are no secret bodies within one or the other of these civilizations trying to take control of the whole body, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

315. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

316. That is an illusory reflection of beliefs that are illusory beliefs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. And we do not in that way contain those in our experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

318. Very human construct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

319. Earth human, Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

320. Earth human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

321. Those that you have in your film and television-- Earth human constructs with beliefs that are illusory, illusory being out of alignment with your actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. We understand our actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. And therefore, the beliefs that which we put within and experience are in alignment with the actual nature of existence, of unconditional love, of the one that is the all, the all that is the one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. And because we know this and we put that out, we get back experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. It's that simple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. We know who we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. We put out beliefs that are in alignment with who we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. The one that is the all that we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. And we get back experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. The infinite effortlessly creates together and co-creates interactions that are of this level of frictionless, non-friction interaction-- fun, fulfillment, friendship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

331. I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. There are people on our planet-- Shaun and myself who-- we were just talking earlier that we sort of live these rules.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. We sort of live these ideas and are physically manifesting this sort of non-friction way of life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. But the human spectrum seems to be so great that Shaun and I can be having this experience of non-friction, yet on another side of the planet, there are others who still embrace this idea of friction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. I guess I'm saying is we have such a wide variety on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. I'm curious to know the variety on the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. It sounds like it doesn't go to that extreme.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

339. It is an infinite variety within the vibration of alignment with actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

340. Earth alignment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

341. The Earth frictions are the result of putting out beliefs that are illusory, out of alignment with one's actual nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. And thus, putting that out, they get back friction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. That is a choice within the infinite that can exist for an infinite period in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. The infinite contains all that can be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. And that can include those who, currently through their upbringing and state of awareness, choose to create friction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. That can continue to exist within the infinite for an infinite amount of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. The idea is you could choose to only experience the free from friction, that which is alignment with actual nature, that which is filled with an infinite number of ways to experience being in alignment with the joy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. The friction-free experiences are infinite in number, unlimited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. So each person has a choice and has the ability to choose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. Do they want to play around in the illusory beliefs that create the frictions or move off into the realm of unhindered joy and excitement in ways that are free from friction, that are fully fulfilling and fascinating, one moment to the next-- new, new, refreshing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. That they're in that realm-- are an infinite number of unlimited realities that can unfold now, and now, and now, it is a choice that you can make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

352. So as we move individually-- as we move into these non-friction realms, these infinite possibilities of joy and non-friction, will we begin to see less and less other people having friction and I guess--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

353. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

354. --in our realities as well?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

355. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

356. OK, so we attract those people who are also in that same vibratory rate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. And the frictioners-- if that's a title, we can call them frictioners--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

359. The frictioners.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

360. --will become sort of less and less, until eventually there's just no frictioners left on the planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

361. They will not be a part of your experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. They will be too vibrational different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

363. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

364. You can and will in time, for it does exist-- a world, a Earth which all Earth humans are living and choosing to know who they are-- the free from friction experience where you all truly have an abundance of what you truly enjoy having, and are supporting and being supported by one another, supporting each other, and supporting yourself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. This is a reality that exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. And you will in time be aware of it, because you will be focused and tuned in with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
