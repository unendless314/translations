261. How would you describe, from your perspective, the angelic realms that we consider on our Earth plane?
→ {"text": "從你的觀點來看，你會如何描述我們地球層面所認為的天使領域呢?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

262. They are non-physical beings that support Earth humans in your life here.
→ {"text": "他們是非物質存有，在你們於此的生命中支持著地球人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. They can be thought of as angelic beings.
→ {"text": "他們可以被視為天使存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. There are extraterrestrials who are in the physical form who support Earth Humans.
→ {"text": "也有一些外星存有以物質形態支持著地球人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. And Earth humans might not be aware of this coming from physical extraterrestrials who might then define their experience and communications as coming from angels or spirit guides.
→ {"text": "地球人類可能並未意識到這些來自物質形態的外星存有，因此可能會將他們的體驗與溝通定義為來自天使或指導靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. So an extraterrestrial could be for someone on Earth, thought of as an angel or a spirit guide, even though they are physical, all the while then being some angels and spirit guides for an Earth human's experience are non-physical consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "因此，對地球上的某個人來說，一位外星存有可能被誤認為是天使或指導靈，即使他們實際上是有物質形態的;同時，在地球人類的體驗中，也確實有些天使與指導靈是非物質的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. So it comes down to, then, which a person is connecting to, to decide or determine, is it a non-physical or a physical being that they are defining or experiencing as an angel, or a spirit guide, or communication with extraterrestrial?
→ {"text": "所以關鍵在於，一個人連結到的是誰，以此決定或判斷，他們所定義或體驗到的天使、指導靈或外星通訊，究竟是非物質存有還是物質存有?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

268. And in your realm where you exist, do you work with-- I'm assuming you work as we do with a lot of these non-physical energies.
→ {"text": "在你們所存在的領域中，你們是否也與——我猜想你們就像我們一樣，與許多這些非物質的能量一起工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

269. Yes, there are a variety of non-physical consciousnesses that support the matrix in a sense, the physical experience, the experience of physicality.
→ {"text": "是的，有各式各樣的非物質意識在支持著這個宇宙的操作系統，也就是物質體驗、物質性的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. There are a variety of consciousnesses interacting that allow for the way we and you are experiencing physicality, that which holds what you experience as time and space in a sense, in a physical spectrum.
→ {"text": "有各種意識在互動，讓我們和你們能以這種方式體驗物質性——那些在某種意義上、在物質光譜中，支撐著你們所體驗到的時間與空間的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. There are consciousnesses that are involved in this that have evolved to be more focused at doing that, that are in a sense, born to do that, in a sense, gifted at doing that.
→ {"text": "參與其中的有些意識已經進化到更專注於做這件事，在某種意義上，他們生而為此，天生擅長於此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. It is their joy in a sense to be that support to live life, almost as if they are the substance that holds the physical experience of your life together.
→ {"text": "在某種意義上，成為那個支持生命的力量就是他們的喜悅，幾乎就像是他們構成了維繫你生命物質體驗的實質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

273. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

274. Conscious being.
→ {"text": "有意識的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. So even, for example, a peach or an apple-- physical item you experience contains some of these conscious beings.
→ {"text": "所以即使是，比如說，一顆桃子或蘋果——你所體驗到的物質物品都包含了某些這樣的有意識存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

276. And this goes back to what Shaun and I were talking about earlier.
→ {"text": "這又回到了我和 Shaun 稍早討論的話題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. When we consume these consciousnesses, we're putting in what-- what you put out is what you get back.
→ {"text": "當我們消費這些意識時，我們所攝入的就是——你付出什麼，就會得到什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

278. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. Now, what you put in, what you put out is what you get back or live within.
→ {"text": "現在，你所攝入的、你所付出的，就是你會得到的回饋，或你所活在其中的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

280. So having awareness of what types of consciousness we consume can help us in our external reality?
→ {"text": "所以覺察我們消費了哪些類型的意識，可以幫助我們改善外在實相?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

281. Yes, it is conscious energies and entities, beings, lifeforms that you are consuming in the food that you are consuming or the chemistry that you are consuming that is interblended with some of the foods or many of the foods that are constructed at this time that many people on Earth are eating, construction of synthetic and chemical consciousnesses with other types of organic consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "是的，你所消費的食物中，包含著有意識的能量、實體、存有、生命形式，或者你所攝入的化學物質——這些化學物質與當前許多地球人正在食用的部分或大量食物混合在一起，是合成與化學意識與其他類型有機意識的建構物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

282. And I'm assuming the constructor-- the cook, the preparer of these foods also puts in their own consciousnesses in the mix.
→ {"text": "而我猜想建構者——廚師、這些食物的準備者，也將他們自己的意識投入了這個混合物中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. And then it becomes--
→ {"text": "然後它就變成了——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

284. Certainly.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

286. --a consciousness soup--
→ {"text": "一道意識之湯——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

288. --and can become quite tasty if you have a good one.
→ {"text": "——而且如果做得好，會變得相當美味。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

289. Very much so.
→ {"text": "非常正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

290. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. So what we're enjoying is not just the taste, but we're also enjoying all the other different consciousnesses that are-- go into that making of this wonderful creation we call like an apple pie or--
→ {"text": "所以我們所享受的不僅是味道，我們也在享受所有其他不同的意識——那些進入製作這個美好創造物的意識，比如我們所稱的蘋果派或——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

292. That can play a part in it.
→ {"text": "那可以在其中發揮作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

294. Wonderful.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. Many of these civilizations have talked about a council of worlds, a sort of federation, a galactic federation.
→ {"text": "許多這些文明都談到過世界委員會，一種聯邦，銀河聯邦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. There's many titles for this.
→ {"text": "有很多種稱呼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. Are you part of...
→ {"text": "你們是其中的一部分嗎⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

298. We interact with those of extraterrestrial origin that, in that way, choose to come together and interact spontaneously to gather enjoyably, supportively to gather.
→ {"text": "我們與那些外星起源的存有互動，以那種方式選擇聚在一起，自發地互動，愉快地聚集，相互支持地聚集。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. When one is no longer in a moment of joy, they will become focused on another venture or activity that is more exciting.
→ {"text": "當某個存有不再處於喜悅的時刻，他們會將焦點轉向另一個更令人興奮的冒險或活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. And they will move along.
→ {"text": "然後他們會繼續前行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. They may come back at another time.
→ {"text": "他們可能會在另一個時間回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. In this way, it is always an interaction of very positive communication and support.
→ {"text": "以這種方式，這始終是非常正面的溝通與支持的互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. We can give it names.
→ {"text": "我們可以為它取各種名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. But it is free from friction and conflict that is imbued or envisoned in your televisions and that which is in the pan of vision of the theater and theatrical movie releases.
→ {"text": "但它是無摩擦和無衝突的，不像你們電視中所灌輸或設想的那樣，或者戲劇與電影發行作品中所呈現的那種景象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

305. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. We sort of formulate our version of that idea and then--
→ {"text": "我們某種程度上形塑了我們自己版本的那個概念，然後——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

307. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

308. --put it into a context that we can understand--
→ {"text": "——將它放入我們能理解的脈絡中——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

309. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

310. --in our specific timeline evolution.
→ {"text": "——在我們特定的時間線演化中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

311. So our interaction is friction free in that way.
→ {"text": "所以我們的互動就是以這種方式無摩擦的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. We are not fighting.
→ {"text": "我們不會鬥爭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. We are not trying to commandeer some other civilization's desires and wishes to supplant our own.

314. There are no secret bodies within one or the other of these civilizations trying to take control of the whole body, so to speak.
→ {"text": "在這些文明的其中任何一個之內，都不存在某些秘密團體試圖控制整個機體，可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

315. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

316. That is an illusory reflection of beliefs that are illusory beliefs.
→ {"text": "那是虛幻信念的虛幻倒影。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. And we do not in that way contain those in our experience.
→ {"text": "而我們的體驗中並不以那種方式包含這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

318. Very human construct.
→ {"text": "非常人類的建構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 129

320. Earth human.
→ {"text": "地球人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

321. Those that you have in your film and television-- Earth human constructs with beliefs that are illusory, illusory being out of alignment with your actual nature.
→ {"text": "你們在電影和電視中所見的那些——地球人類帶著虛幻信念的建構物，虛幻意味著與你們的真實本質不一致。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. We understand our actual nature.
→ {"text": "我們理解我們的真實本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And therefore, the beliefs that which we put within and experience are in alignment with the actual nature of existence, of unconditional love, of the one that is the all, the all that is the one.
→ {"text": "因此，我們所放入內在並體驗的信念，都與存在的真實本質、與無條件的愛、與那一即全、全即一的本質保持一致。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. And because we know this and we put that out, we get back experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "而因為我們知曉這點並將其付出，我們就得到與之一致的體驗回饋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. It's that simple.
→ {"text": "就是這麼簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. We know who we are.
→ {"text": "我們知道我們是誰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. We put out beliefs that are in alignment with who we are.

328. The one that is the all that we are.
→ {"text": "那個一即全的我們之所是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And we get back experiences in alignment with that.
→ {"text": "而我們得到與之一致的體驗回饋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. The infinite effortlessly creates together and co-creates interactions that are of this level of frictionless, non-friction interaction-- fun, fulfillment, friendship.
→ {"text": "這樣的無限創造是自然而輕鬆的，它共同創造出這種無摩擦的互動——充滿樂趣、滿足感和友誼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

331. I understand.
→ {"text": "我理解了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. There are people on our planet-- Shaun and myself who-- we were just talking earlier that we sort of live these rules.
→ {"text": "我們星球上有些人——Shaun 和我——我們剛才還在談論我們某種程度上活出了這些法則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. We sort of live these ideas and are physically manifesting this sort of non-friction way of life.
→ {"text": "我們某種程度上活出了這些理念，並且在物質層面展現出這種無摩擦的生活方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. But the human spectrum seems to be so great that Shaun and I can be having this experience of non-friction, yet on another side of the planet, there are others who still embrace this idea of friction.
→ {"text": "但人類的光譜似乎如此廣闊，以至於 Shaun 和我可以擁有這種無摩擦的體驗，然而在地球的另一端，仍有其他人擁抱著摩擦的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. I guess I'm saying is we have such a wide variety on Earth.
→ {"text": "我猜我想說的是，地球上有如此廣泛的多樣性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. I'm curious to know the variety on the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "我很好奇亞耶爾文明的多樣性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. It sounds like it doesn't go to that extreme.
→ {"text": "聽起來似乎不會走到那種極端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

339. It is an infinite variety within the vibration of alignment with actual nature.
→ {"text": "那是在與真實本質一致的振動中的無限多樣性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

340. Earth alignment.
→ {"text": "地球的對齊。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境較簡短,可能指地球層面的對齊狀態"}


## Speaker Group 134

341. The Earth frictions are the result of putting out beliefs that are illusory, out of alignment with one's actual nature.
→ {"text": "地球的摩擦是付出虛幻信念的結果，那些與自身真實本質不一致的信念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. And thus, putting that out, they get back friction.
→ {"text": "因此，付出那些信念，他們就得到摩擦的回饋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. That is a choice within the infinite that can exist for an infinite period in a sense.
→ {"text": "那是無限之中的一個選擇，在某種意義上可以存在無限的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. The infinite contains all that can be.
→ {"text": "無限包含了所有可能存在的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. And that can include those who, currently through their upbringing and state of awareness, choose to create friction.
→ {"text": "而這可以包括那些目前透過他們的成長背景和覺知狀態，選擇創造摩擦的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. That can continue to exist within the infinite for an infinite amount of time.
→ {"text": "那可以在無限之中持續存在無限長的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. The idea is you could choose to only experience the free from friction, that which is alignment with actual nature, that which is filled with an infinite number of ways to experience being in alignment with the joy.
→ {"text": "重點是你可以選擇只體驗無摩擦的狀態，那與真實本質一致的狀態，那充滿了無限種方式來體驗與喜悅一致的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. The friction-free experiences are infinite in number, unlimited.
→ {"text": "無摩擦的體驗在數量上是無限的、無限制的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. So each person has a choice and has the ability to choose.
→ {"text": "所以每個人都有選擇，都有能力去選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. Do they want to play around in the illusory beliefs that create the frictions or move off into the realm of unhindered joy and excitement in ways that are free from friction, that are fully fulfilling and fascinating, one moment to the next-- new, new, refreshing.
→ {"text": "因此，每個人都可以選擇，他們是想繼續在創造摩擦的幻象信念中遊玩，還是進入充滿喜悅和興奮的無摩擦領域，這些領域令人滿足且迷人，每一刻都充滿嶄新、清新的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. That they're in that realm-- are an infinite number of unlimited realities that can unfold now, and now, and now, it is a choice that you can make.
→ {"text": "在那個領域中——存在著無限數量的無限實相，可以在此刻、現在、當下展開，這是你可以做出的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

352. So as we move individually-- as we move into these non-friction realms, these infinite possibilities of joy and non-friction, will we begin to see less and less other people having friction and I guess--
→ {"text": "所以當我們個別地——當我們進入這些無摩擦的領域，這些喜悅與無摩擦的無限可能性，我們是否會開始看到越來越少經歷摩擦的人，而且我想——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

353. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

354. --in our realities as well?
→ {"text": "——在我們的實相中也是如此?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

355. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

356. OK, so we attract those people who are also in that same vibratory rate.
→ {"text": "好的，所以我們會吸引那些也處於相同振動頻率的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And the frictioners-- if that's a title, we can call them frictioners--
→ {"text": "而那些摩擦者——如果這可以是個稱呼的話，我們可以稱他們為摩擦者——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

359. The frictioners.
→ {"text": "摩擦者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

360. --will become sort of less and less, until eventually there's just no frictioners left on the planet.
→ {"text": "——會變得越來越少，直到最終這個星球上就沒有摩擦者了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

361. They will not be a part of your experience.
→ {"text": "他們不會成為你體驗的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. They will be too vibrational different.
→ {"text": "他們的振動會太過不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

363. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

364. You can and will in time, for it does exist-- a world, a Earth which all Earth humans are living and choosing to know who they are-- the free from friction experience where you all truly have an abundance of what you truly enjoy having, and are supporting and being supported by one another, supporting each other, and supporting yourself.
→ {"text": "你可以，也將會在某個時刻，因為它確實存在——一個世界，一個地球，所有地球人類都在其中生活並選擇知曉他們真正是誰——那個無摩擦的體驗，在其中你們所有人真正擁有你們真正喜歡擁有的豐盛，並且相互支持、被彼此支持，支持彼此，也支持你自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. This is a reality that exists.
→ {"text": "這是一個存在的實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. And you will in time be aware of it, because you will be focused and tuned in with it.
→ {"text": "而你將會在某個時刻覺察到它，因為你會專注於它並與它調頻共振。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
