## Speaker Group 80

216. Very powerful visual contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

217. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. In a boomerang shape, isn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

220. Yes.

221. And a visual contact occurred.

## Speaker Group 83

222. And is this Yahyel civilization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

223. Primarily, this was of our co-creation with your civilization, although we were not alone in terms of extraterrestrial civilizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. But it was primarily our civilization bringing a larger input into your awareness on a conscious level of our existence at a time and in a way that on a super-conscious level, your civilization knew about in advance, agreed to, co-created, understood, understands, can see what is occurring-- past, present, future timelines and understands the powerful, beneficial results and growth in positive, nurturing ways for all involved in that choice to have that come out, come through, evolve,

225. develop in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

226. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Well, it still is a large imprint on the collective consciousness and continues to expand, so thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

228. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. And there were others before, perhaps not as highlighted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. There were others since.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. And there will be a variety of other ones coming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. The light forms will vary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. At times, they will not seem to come from a craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. They will seem to be very organic in form, and shape, and coloration as though they are phenomena of space and time itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

235. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. Would you be able to name some of these other civilizations that you work with closely?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

237. They are those you are most familiar with at this time in terms of the ones that are to focus and be aware of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. There are others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. Yes, but not to come through at this time, simply because you will then, through your own mechanisms, begin focusing and expanding your focus when truly focusing your focus will bring greater connection in a more heartfelt, intelligent way, allowing for clarity through simplification, focus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. Pleiadians-- yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. There are certainly a variety of Pleiadian civilizations that have a very close contact, conversing, communication, co-creation, interrelation with our civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

242. Do you also share DNA from the Pleiadian civilization as we do?

## Speaker Group 92

246. Learning which then will be most applicable for you in unfolding a future and a present that you most enjoy fulfillingly, will then provide the greatest excitement for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. Understand, then, to know that there are in a sense no end to the numbers to suggest that it is not finite, perhaps allows you to focus more on a finite number of them.

248. To know that there are an infinite number.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. And in this physical embodiment, your awareness will not truly embody all of the infinite number of them nor need it do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. Allow, then, to focus, to know the ones that are of greatest heartfelt support will find you as you open up and focus on those.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. But reaching out to uncover new ones can be a joy to do, I understand.

→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

255. It's so expansive into--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

256. It will guide you beyond that which you are aware or have heard of in terms of trying to create a family tree of sorts or a point of origination, for the point changes as you learn of the next one, and then changes as you learn of the next one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

257. Yeah, that seems to be the case, and that's exciting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98
