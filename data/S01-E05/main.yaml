  source_text: My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer and that is a clever name
    myself and Kalina fell into so it was a great synchronicity and the reason that
    it fits is because throughout the last 7 years I've contacted or channeled over
    100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.
  translation:
    text: 我的名字是 Rob，我是外星耳語者（ET Whisperer），這個名字是我和卡莉娜（Kalina）無意間想到的，真是個美妙的共時性。之所以很適合，是因為在過去
      7 年裡，我接觸或通靈了超過 100 個不同的外星意識。

  source_text: I've not done collective consciousnesses as much, but I have tapped
    into some of those, some Archangels but for some reason the ET thing sticks with
    me very well and it fits the energy very well so thats where I like to stay in
    My connection process is a little different than the rest of the channelers.
  translation:
    text: 我沒有太常接觸集體意識，但也接觸過一些，還有一些大天使。但不知為何，外星存有這部分跟我特別契合，能量也非常吻合，所以這是我喜歡專注的領域。我的連結過程跟其他通靈者有點不太一樣。
