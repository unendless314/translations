  source_text: My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer and that is a clever name
    myself and Kalina fell into so it was a great synchronicity and the reason that
    it fits is because throughout the last 7 years I've contacted or channeled over
    100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.

    text: 我叫羅伯，我是「外星耳語者」，這個名字是我和卡莉娜碰巧想到的，真是個美妙的共時性。之所以這麼稱呼我，是因為在過去七年裡，我接觸並通靈了超過一百個不同的外星意識。

  source_text: I've not done collective consciousnesses as much, but I have tapped
    into some of those, some Archangels but for some reason the ET thing sticks with
    me very well and it fits the energy very well so thats where I like to stay in
    My connection process is a little different than the rest of the channelers.
  translation:
    text: 我接觸集體意識的經驗不多，但也連結過一些，還有一些大天使，但不知為何，外星意識這塊特別適合我，能量非常契合，所以這是我喜歡專注的領域。我的連結過程跟其他通靈者有點不同。

    to help co-create more excitement.
