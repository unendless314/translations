316. So that led you into the channeling state?
→ {"text": "所以那引導你進入通靈狀態了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Or did you get to talk to spirits, I should say?
→ {"text": "或者說，你有沒有跟靈體對話？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

318. I never got real contact with spirits in the way I wanted to.
→ {"text": "我從來沒有以我想要的方式真正接觸到靈體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

319. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

320. But my belief system then was I should be hearing them in my ears, like audioclairancy or something.
→ {"text": "但我當時的信念系統是，我應該要用耳朵聽到他們的聲音，像是聽覺通靈之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. And that should be the experience.
→ {"text": "那才應該是真正的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. But I had gotten pictures or ideas.
→ {"text": "但我得到的是畫面或想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And that really never happened in the Gateway Experience.
→ {"text": "而那種情況在門戶體驗中從來沒有真正發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. There were times where I was able--
→ {"text": "曾經有幾次我能夠——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

325. Gateway is the church, or no?
→ {"text": "門戶體驗是教會嗎，還是不是？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

326. No, Gateway was the Hemi-Sync.
→ {"text": "不是，門戶體驗就是半腦同步技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

327. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

328. That part really never gave me any kind of spirit contact.
→ {"text": "那部分從來沒有給我任何與靈體的接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. Although, I do know that I was connecting to different energies.
→ {"text": "雖然，我確實知道我在連結不同的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. Maybe not aware in the moment, questioning that.
→ {"text": "也許當下沒有意識到，對此抱有疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. And that was something the church had helped me with before, to stop questioning myself, because that's a big, big part of tapping into your intuition.
→ {"text": "而教會之前幫助過我的一件事，就是停止質疑自己，因為那是連結直覺的非常重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

332. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

333. So I go through these.
→ {"text": "所以我經歷了這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. And I get all sorts of experiences, out-of-body experiences, not controlled.
→ {"text": "我得到了各種體驗，靈魂出竅體驗，但無法控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. And I still-- to this day, I can astral project, but I can't tell myself where to go.
→ {"text": "而我到今天仍然——我能夠星光體投射，但我無法告訴自己要去哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. I can't say, I want to go down the street and hang out in the bar in spirit form.
→ {"text": "我無法說，我想以靈體形態走到街上去酒吧晃晃。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. I can't do that.
→ {"text": "我做不到那種事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

338. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. But you can shoot out of your body.
→ {"text": "但你可以射出你的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

340. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "哦，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

341. And then it just kind of--
→ {"text": "然後它就有點像是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

342. Every time I connect in channeling, that's what I'm doing.
→ {"text": "每次我在通靈時連結，我做的就是這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

343. And then you just-- it just floats around, and you're just kind of observing whatever appears to you? Or how does that--
→ {"text": "然後你就——它就四處飄浮，而你就是在觀察任何出現在你面前的東西嗎？還是說那是怎樣——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

344. Well, I've had experiences like that.
→ {"text": "嗯，我確實有過那樣的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. But most of time, it's like an experience going out into a different environment altogether.
→ {"text": "但大部分時候，就像是進入一個完全不同的環境的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. I've experienced other planets.
→ {"text": "我體驗過其他星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. I've experienced other parts of reality here, different times.
→ {"text": "我體驗過這裡的其他實相部分，不同的時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. But how I connected to TReb was different.
→ {"text": "但我與崔博連結的方式是不同的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. I had not had an out-of-body that was severely powerful or very, very deep in meaning to me.
→ {"text": "我從來沒有過極度強大或對我來說非常、非常有深刻意義的靈魂出竅體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. And I had a real messed up night that night.
→ {"text": "而那天晚上我真的過得很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. I watched the Hubble Deep space thing for the first time, the 3D one that they had on YouTube.
→ {"text": "我第一次看了哈伯深空的影片，YouTube 上那個 3D 的版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

352. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "哦，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

353. And it touched my heart, but it kind of made me feel empty, like I can't go out there.
→ {"text": "而它觸動了我的心，但它讓我感到有點空虛，就像我無法去到那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. I can't be a part of that.
→ {"text": "我無法成為那的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. And it really kind of made me depressed a little.
→ {"text": "而它真的讓我有點沮喪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. So I used a meditation.
→ {"text": "所以我進行了一次冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. In the Hemi-Sync, they go through steps 1 through 21.
→ {"text": "在半腦同步技術中，他們會經歷第 1 到第 21 個步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And I decided one night, well, why don't I just go past 21.
→ {"text": "而有一天晚上我決定，好吧，我何不就超越 21 呢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. And that was that night of depression.
→ {"text": "而那就是我沮喪的那個晚上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. And that's when I met TReb.
→ {"text": "而那就是我遇見崔博的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. And when I met TReb, it was--
→ {"text": "而當我遇見崔博時，那是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

362. Steps 1 through 21, and what do you mean by going past 21?
→ {"text": "第 1 到第 21 個步驟，你說超越 21 是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Do they have actually steps after 21?
→ {"text": "他們實際上有 21 之後的步驟嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

364. No. >> Oh.
→ {"text": "沒有。>> 哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

365. They do 1 through 21.
→ {"text": "他們只做第 1 到第 21 個步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. And basically, when you're meditating, you're counting.
→ {"text": "而基本上，當你在冥想時，你在數數。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. It's a self-hypnosis.
→ {"text": "那是一種自我催眠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. That's what meditation is.
→ {"text": "這就是冥想的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. It's a self-hypnosis.
→ {"text": "就是一種自我催眠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. And each step that you take, you go deeper in.
→ {"text": "而你每走一步，你就進入更深。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. So step 1, you're starting to feel less your body, and then it goes on.
→ {"text": "所以在第 1 步，你開始越來越感覺不到你的身體，然後它繼續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. So I went past the 21.
→ {"text": "所以我超越了 21。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. And that's the maximum of the Gateway Experience, is the 21st-- They call it the 21 state.
→ {"text": "而那是門戶體驗的最高階段，就是第 21——他們稱之為焦點 21。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

374. What's at 21?
→ {"text": "21 是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. Can you reveal what's at 21?
→ {"text": "你能揭示 21 是什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

376. Well, 21 state is basically a full-blown conscious integration.
→ {"text": "嗯，焦點 21 基本上是一種完全的意識整合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. You can connect with your higher self.
→ {"text": "你可以與你的高我連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. You can leave your body.
→ {"text": "你可以離開你的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. At that point, you're at the deepest level of consciousness available.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，你處於可達到的最深層次的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

380. And did you kind of in your own mind then say OK, we're going 22.
→ {"text": "然後你是不是在自己的心裡說，好的，我們要去 22 了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

381. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. And I just-- and it wasn't even a number.
→ {"text": "而我只是——甚至不是一個數字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. I didn't go 22, 23.
→ {"text": "我沒有去 22、23。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

384. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

385. I just went beyond.
→ {"text": "我只是超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. Now, it's time to go beyond.
→ {"text": "現在，是時候超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. And I did it in the moment.
→ {"text": "而我在那一刻做到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

388. Through the veil.
→ {"text": "穿越面紗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

389. Not deciding before, in the moment, and that's when I connected to TReb, right then.
→ {"text": "不是事先決定，而是在那一刻，那就是我與崔博連結的時候，就在那時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

390. Wow!
→ {"text": "哇！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

391. Now when I'm connecting to TReb, this is very surreal.
→ {"text": "現在，當我與崔博連結時，這非常超現實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. It's very realistic.
→ {"text": "它非常真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. It's just like me and you sitting here talking today.
→ {"text": "就像我和你今天坐在這裡聊天一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. And that's the first time I'd ever left my body in such a fashion.
→ {"text": "而那是我第一次以這種方式離開我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

395. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

396. Before when I left my body, there would be tracers or sound would be gone, or the images were blurry, or vibrating.
→ {"text": "之前當我離開身體時，會有拖曳殘影，或者聲音會消失，或者影像會模糊，或者震動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. It was always different, but never this clear.
→ {"text": "它總是不同的，但從來沒有這麼清晰過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. I was on a ship.
→ {"text": "我在一艘飛船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. I know that much now, because I've been back to those ships before.
→ {"text": "我現在知道那麼多，因為我之前曾回到過那些飛船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. It was one of the Yit ships, which is TReb's people.

401. And I was sitting there in a room by myself.

402. And eventually, through the door comes TReb.

403. And this, it scared the shit out of me.
→ {"text": "而這，把我嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. It was a horribly menacing being that was-- you're looking up to, 7 and 1/2 foot.
→ {"text": "那是一個極其可怕威脅的存有——你要抬頭仰望，七呎半高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. I'm sitting in this chair, and I'm instantly transported sitting in a chair.
→ {"text": "我坐在這張椅子上，而我瞬間就被傳送到一張椅子上坐著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. I always joke, it's like a futuristic space doctor waiting room, because you're just sitting there.
→ {"text": "我總是開玩笑說，那就像一個未來太空醫生的候診室，因為你就只是坐在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. And there is a sign that has this writing over here to the right.
→ {"text": "而右邊這裡有一個標誌，上面有文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. And it's not written in English.
→ {"text": "而它不是用英文寫的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. But after looking at it long enough, I could tell.
→ {"text": "但看了夠久之後，我能夠解讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. And it basically says something to the effect: Just sit here, and someone will be with you soon, type thing.
→ {"text": "而它基本上說的意思是：請在此稍候，馬上就有人來找你，那種感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. And I laughed about that.
→ {"text": "而我對那笑了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. I still-- I don't know if I made--
→ {"text": "我至今仍然——我不知道是不是我自己編造的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

413. You interpreted it.
→ {"text": "你解讀了它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. You interpreted it as sit here.
→ {"text": "你把它解讀成在此稍候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. OK.

## Speaker Group 103

416. And I wait.

→ {"text": "那件銀色的服裝，他甚至穿著一件銀色長袍和金色靴子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. And I'm thinking to myself, if I were trying to pull out the cheesiest space futuristic suit, what would it be?
→ {"text": "而我心裡想著，如果我想要弄出最俗氣的太空未來風裝扮，那會是什麼樣子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. I was able to relax.

## Speaker Group 114

448. And he didn't go detailed.

## Speaker Group 115

450. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

451. And the way telepathy works is that when-- they're using your words to try to convey a message.
→ {"text": "而心電感應的運作方式是，當——他們在使用你的詞彙來試圖傳達訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. And you don't necessarily get words per se.
→ {"text": "而你不一定會得到真正的詞語本身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. It's just kind of a group thought.
→ {"text": "它只是一種群組思維。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. All of this coming to me at once.
→ {"text": "所有這些一次全部湧向我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. And it was so overwhelming and so powerful that it was hard to remember a lot of the things that we talked about the first couple of times.
→ {"text": "而它是如此壓倒性和如此強大，以至於很難記住我們前幾次談論的很多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. It was so clear.

459. And he said, I'm here.

→ {"text": "如果你想與我連結，我在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And I left.
→ {"text": "然後我離開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "而現在，在這個時候，當我開始半腦同步技術時，我是全力以赴的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. I'm three times a day meditation for an hour, an hour 25 each.
→ {"text": "我每天冥想三次，每次一小時，一小時二十五分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. Plus using closed-eye technique, where I'm just turning sounds into vibrations and energy, and understanding that.
→ {"text": "加上使用閉眼技法，我只是將聲音轉化為振動和能量，並理解那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. It's kind of a self-taught technique that I taught myself.
→ {"text": "那是一種我自學的技巧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

467. Basically, after learning these meditations I would utilize, I was hooked on meditation.
→ {"text": "基本上，在學會這些我會使用的冥想之後，我沉迷於冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. And in my mind, to miss a day of meditation is like missing breathing oxygen.
→ {"text": "而在我心裡，錯過一天的冥想就像錯過呼吸氧氣一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. But after that, it was so intense and so odd, I skipped meditating for over four days before I reconnected.
→ {"text": "但在那之後，它是如此強烈和如此奇怪，我停止冥想超過四天才重新連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
