553. And on that documentary, they started talking about channeling.
→ {"text": "而在那部紀錄片裡，他們開始談論通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. So you didn't know about channeling.
→ {"text": "所以你不知道通靈這回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

556. Nothing about channeling.
→ {"text": "對通靈一無所知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 157

558. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

559. That's what their whole deal was, but I never heard the term channeling.
→ {"text": "那是他們整個重點，但我從沒聽過「通靈」這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. And although I had seen it in the church-- people getting messages directly through them-- I never knew exactly what it was.
→ {"text": "雖然我在教會看過這種情況——人們直接透過他們傳遞訊息——但我從來不知道那到底是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

## Speaker Group 161

563. Sure.

## Speaker Group 162

564. So I watch it.

565. And there's-- only out of the whole hour and a half documentary, it's like a five-minute clip.
→ {"text": "而那裡面——整部一個半小時的紀錄片中，只有大約五分鐘的片段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. And out of that, they talk about the Law of One, which was an ET contact channeling from the '80s, the "Law of One, Ra Material."
→ {"text": "而在那當中，他們談到一的法則，那是來自 80 年代的外星接觸通靈，「一的法則，Ra 資料」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Law of One 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「一的法則」"}

→ {"text": "我興奮地坐在那裡，但不太知道我應該聽什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "那句話比其他五分鐘的談話更抓住我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

574. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

575. So that's what I checked out.
→ {"text": "所以那就是我去查的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. And now looking back, I know why, because the "Ra Material" was pretty far out there comparatively. The "Seth Material" was more mainstream.
→ {"text": "現在回頭看，我知道為什麼了，因為「Ra 資料」相對來說太過前衛了。「賽斯資料」更主流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. It was more about consciousness and evolution of the soul, which was what TReb had talked to me about.
→ {"text": "它更多是關於意識和靈魂的演化，而這正是崔博跟我談過的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. So I locked into that.
→ {"text": "所以我鎖定了那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. I looked it up, got all the audio clips, downloaded the PDF.
→ {"text": "我查了資料，拿到所有音頻片段，下載了 PDF。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. All of these things online.
→ {"text": "這些東西都在網上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

581. From "Seth" and "Ra," or just the "Seth?"
→ {"text": "從「賽斯」和「Ra」，還是只有「賽斯」？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

582. Just the "Seth."
→ {"text": "只有「賽斯」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. The "Ra Material" was still out of my scope, off my radar.
→ {"text": "「Ra 資料」還在我的範圍之外，不在我的雷達上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

584. Even though you've seen a big purple-eyed--
→ {"text": "即使你看過一個有著大大的紫色眼睛的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

585. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. You would think that the rest would be OK, right?
→ {"text": "你會覺得其他的應該都沒問題了，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. And I never looked at it that way.
→ {"text": "而我從來沒有那樣看待它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. But I always know there was a reason.
→ {"text": "但我一直知道有個原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

589. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

590. And when I dug in, I found out what it was.
→ {"text": "而當我深入研究時，我發現了它是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. Seth was saying the same thing that TReb said, just in different terms and different terminology.
→ {"text": "賽斯說的跟崔博說的是同一件事，只是用不同的術語和不同的詞彙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. And some of these terms were new to me.
→ {"text": "而其中一些術語對我來說是新的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. And I had to really kind of focus.
→ {"text": "我必須真的很專注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. Some of the words, I had no idea what they even meant, but I would go through, and I studied.
→ {"text": "有些字詞，我完全不知道它們是什麼意思，但我會繼續讀下去，然後我研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. And what it was, I am not a reader.
→ {"text": "而事實是，我不是一個閱讀者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. I don't read.
→ {"text": "我不閱讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. I listen, like audio books are my thing.

## Speaker Group 173

598. Same way.
→ {"text": "我也是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 176

602. Nice.

603. I have it in the PDF format, and I have it on my iPhone.

604. It's a process, but still, I can go through it much faster by listening to it.
→ {"text": "這是個過程，但還是，我可以透過聆聽更快地讀完它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

607. It's helpful, to say the least.
→ {"text": "至少可以說很有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. That's how I retain that information.
→ {"text": "那就是我如何保留那些資訊的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

609. So I find this one little clip.
→ {"text": "所以我找到了這個小片段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. It's like an hour and 50 minutes.
→ {"text": "大約一小時五十分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. And it's excerpts of "Seth Speaks, the Eternal Validity of the Soul."
→ {"text": "而那是「賽斯說，靈魂永恆的有效性」的摘錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "書名翻譯"}


## Speaker Group 179

612. It's the clip on YouTube?
→ {"text": "是 YouTube 上的片段嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

613. There's one on YouTube, and there was one downloadable one that just had the excerpts from this guy who enjoyed that, he read, and it was professionally done.
→ {"text": "YouTube 上有一個，還有一個可下載的版本，裡面只有這個喜歡那本書的人讀的摘錄，而且是專業製作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. And I listened to it, and it changed my whole perspective on a lot of stuff.
→ {"text": "而我聽了它，它改變了我對很多事情的整個觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. And it was so powerful and so resonant with what TReb had already said to me.
→ {"text": "而它是如此強大，與崔博已經對我說過的事情如此共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. And when I heard that, it reconfirmed that maybe I wasn't making this stuff up in my head.
→ {"text": "而當我聽到那個的時候，它再次確認了也許我不是在腦子裡編造這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

617. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

618. And this is something I never have said publicly before, but in that four-day period where I stayed away from the meditation and didn't go back to TReb, I actually went to the emergency room and said, I had this experience.
→ {"text": "而這是我以前從未公開說過的事，但在那四天我遠離冥想、沒有回去找崔博的期間，我實際上去了急診室，說，我有過這樣的經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 186

627. Which gave me relief.
→ {"text": "這讓我鬆了一口氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 194

640. If it would have been a different doctor--
→ {"text": "如果是另一個醫生的話——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

641. He didn't give you a shot and strap you to a bed, and hook you up to a bunch of machines.

## Speaker Group 198

651. And from there, it just kept going.

→ {"text": "現在，大多數在廣播或 YouTube 上聽過崔博或阿里迪夫的人，他們可能不知道整個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. I thought I was ready to teach people, and I was.

678. And she's like you really are a channeler.

→ {"text": "因為很多通靈者對其他靈性導師都渾然不知，只是因為他們在自己的節奏裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. Well, that was a concern of mine, too.

→ {"text": "通靈這個想法對我來說很酷，而我們努力實現了它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

695. So when you said you want-- you asked him to be there, but in essence, channeling, you're asking him to come through.
→ {"text": "所以當你說你想要——你要求他在那裡，但本質上，通靈，你是在要求他穿過來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

703. So it all felt just like we're having a conversation just now.
→ {"text": "所以這一切就像我們現在正在對話一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

704. Only you're on a ship always, or--
→ {"text": "只是你總是在飛船上，還是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

705. No.

707. The first time was a ship.
→ {"text": "第一次是在飛船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
