191. That's when I really started diving in.
→ {"text": "那時候我才真正開始深入探索。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. One thing I always believed-- and science could not quench my hunger for the desire of how things started-- chemically, yes.
→ {"text": "有一件事我一直相信——科學無法滿足我對於事物如何開始的渴望——化學上，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. Engineering of the universe, sure.
→ {"text": "宇宙的工程結構，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. But never that god that I knew was there.
→ {"text": "但從來無法解釋我知道存在的那個神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

195. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

196. So that was the one thing I took into my beginning of this spiritual journey, god.
→ {"text": "所以那是我在靈性旅程開始時帶著的唯一東西——神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. And one thing too-- a lot of the times during my whole life, UFOs, ghosts, those two things were really something that my friend and I had talked about all the time.
→ {"text": "還有一件事——在我整個人生中，不明飛行物、鬼魂，這兩件事一直是我和朋友經常談論的話題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. And there was never an explanation from the church or science for either one.
→ {"text": "而無論是教會還是科學，對這兩者都從未有過解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. And the afterlife thing was always something that amazed me.
→ {"text": "來世這件事一直讓我感到驚奇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. I'd seen these psychics on TV who said I can talk to spirits in the afterlife.
→ {"text": "我在電視上看過那些通靈者說他們能與來世的靈體對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And I was very, very skeptical, to say the least.
→ {"text": "我當時非常、非常懷疑，至少可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. But some of the things they would say would be profound.
→ {"text": "但他們說的一些事情確實很深刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. And I thought, that's a starting point.
→ {"text": "我想，這是個起點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. Let's look into that.
→ {"text": "讓我們深入了解一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. I found a church that integrated their desire to look on the other side of death, so that they could bring answers from the other side.
→ {"text": "我找到了一個教會，他們將探索死亡彼岸的渴望融入其中，這樣他們就能從彼岸帶來答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And they believe in God.
→ {"text": "他們相信神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. And they followed a bit of the Bible too, which was a comfort zone, I guess, for me from my childhood belief.
→ {"text": "他們也遵循聖經的一部分，我想這對我來說是個舒適區，源於我童年的信仰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. So I jumped in.
→ {"text": "所以我就加入了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. And when I went there, they taught me meditation.
→ {"text": "當我去那裡時，他們教我冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. Right off the bat, I got a reading from the person, the deacon, or the pastor, whatever title he had, and it was spot on.
→ {"text": "一開始，我就從那個人那裡得到了一次靈性解讀——執事、或是牧師，不管他的頭銜是什麼——結果非常準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. He didn't know me.
→ {"text": "他不認識我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. No one from the church knew me.
→ {"text": "教會裡沒有人認識我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. No one had my social media profile.
→ {"text": "沒有人有我的社交媒體資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. But yet, they told me things about my son.
→ {"text": "但他們卻告訴了我關於我兒子的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. And they told me things about relatives that, at first, I had no clue.
→ {"text": "他們還告訴我關於親戚的事，一開始我完全不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. But when I went to my dad, who follows genealogy and our family tree. He said: Wow, this person from six generations ago had this and this.
→ {"text": "但當我去問我爸爸，他有在追蹤家譜和家族樹。他說：哇，六代以前的這個人確實有這些那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. So it was perfect.
→ {"text": "所以完全準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

218. So it matched up.
→ {"text": "所以對得上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

219. Synchronicity.
→ {"text": "共時性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. And it hit me so hard that he could have that kind of information.
→ {"text": "他能擁有那種資訊讓我震驚不已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. That drew a level of reality to me.
→ {"text": "那為我帶來了一種實相的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. It drew some realness to it.
→ {"text": "那賦予了它某種真實性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

223. Well, just to back up.
→ {"text": "嗯，讓我們往回說一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. When you said you started noticing the animals or I guess your perspective on animals had changed, was there a specific event or something that made that happen, or did it just happen?
→ {"text": "你說你開始注意到動物，或者說你對動物的看法改變了，有什麼特定事件或某件事導致這種情況發生，還是它就這樣發生了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

225. It was a lot of little things.
→ {"text": "是很多小事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. For instance, the way my dogs would come to me, instead of just kind of-- they would always come to get petted or something, but they would come and spend time with me.
→ {"text": "比如說，我的狗來找我的方式，不只是那種——他們以前總是來討摸或什麼的，但現在他們會來陪伴我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Little things like that.
→ {"text": "像這樣的小事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

228. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

229. Going out in the woods.
→ {"text": "走進森林裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. As a younger person, I hunted.
→ {"text": "我年輕的時候，我打獵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. It's Michigan culture.
→ {"text": "這是密西根的文化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

232. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

233. I was raised here.
→ {"text": "我在這裡長大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

234. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

235. So I hunted all the time.
→ {"text": "所以我一直在打獵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. And the last time I went hunting was right around that time.
→ {"text": "我最後一次打獵就是在那個時候左右。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. I had a deer right in my sights.
→ {"text": "我的瞄準鏡裡正好有一隻鹿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. I actually fell asleep in the woods.
→ {"text": "我其實在森林裡睡著了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And I woke up, and this deer is five foot from me.
→ {"text": "當我醒來時，這隻鹿就在離我五呎的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. And I had my gun, unlocked the trigger, put it right on the deer, and I couldn't pull the trigger.
→ {"text": "我拿著槍，解開扳機保險，瞄準了那隻鹿，但我扣不下扳機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. And after that, I never went back out in the woods.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我再也沒有回到森林裡打獵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Those types of things.
→ {"text": "就是這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Very hard, very big.
→ {"text": "非常艱難，非常重大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. But a lot of little things that led up to it that really made me understand what that connection was a bit more than just the animal-human perspective that Christianity, and just humans in general, believe in.
→ {"text": "但很多引導到這一刻的小事，真的讓我理解那種連結是什麼——遠不只是基督教，或者說人類普遍相信的動物與人類的關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

245. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. I remember you mentioned before that you had gotten involved with some recordings from the Monroe Institute.
→ {"text": "我記得你之前提到過你接觸了一些來自門羅研究所的錄音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

247. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. I would meditate all the time.
→ {"text": "我一直在冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. And I kept gaining more experiences.
→ {"text": "而我持續獲得更多體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. And I finally just kind of pooped out on it, and it just stopped.
→ {"text": "最後我就筋疲力盡了，就停止了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. After that, I started looking online.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我開始在網路上搜尋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. And that's when I found the Monroe Institute.
→ {"text": "那時候我就找到了門羅研究所。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. I found some binaural stuff.
→ {"text": "我發現了一些雙耳節拍的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. And then I found Hemi-Sync, which was the biggest and best out there.
→ {"text": "然後我發現了半腦同步技術，這是當時最大、最好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. It's what was claimed.
→ {"text": "至少是這樣宣稱的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

256. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

257. I started the Gateway Experience course, which was a six course-- six part per course, and then six courses of meditation, which increased my meditation ability tremendously.
→ {"text": "我開始了門戶體驗課程，這是六個課程——每個課程有六個部分，然後總共六個冥想課程，這極大地提升了我的冥想能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. This is where all of the astral projection states come in.
→ {"text": "這就是所有星光體投射狀態出現的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. This is where all of the out of body experiences-- it took my meditation to such a level beyond anything I thought was possible at that point.
→ {"text": "這就是所有靈魂出竅體驗的開始——它將我的冥想帶到了遠超我當時認為可能的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. I had only used meditation before to try to open myself for communication with spirits, dead humans.
→ {"text": "我以前只用冥想來嘗試敞開自己，與靈體、逝去的人類溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. That's all I cared about.
→ {"text": "那是我唯一在意的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

262. Oh, you did.
→ {"text": "哦，你有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

264. That was my intent in my meditation.
→ {"text": "那是我冥想的目的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

265. When you were in church, still with the church?
→ {"text": "當你在教會時，還跟教會在一起？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

266. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

267. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. The, the spirits was what their church was involved with.
→ {"text": "靈體是他們教會所涉及的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. That was the whole focal point of their church, was to communicate with people who had died to give proof of afterlife.
→ {"text": "那是他們教會的整個焦點，就是與逝去的人溝通，以證明來世的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

270. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

271. And that was important to me.
→ {"text": "那對我很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. And I thought that wasn't the only intent for meditation.
→ {"text": "我當時認為那不是冥想的唯一目的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

273. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

274. My meditation came because, like drugs helped pull me out of pain and suffering, this new excitement I found whenever I would start to go down and start to feel a little cruddy or start getting back in those low points again, I would use meditation.
→ {"text": "我的冥想是因為，就像毒品幫助我擺脫痛苦和煎熬一樣，每當我開始低落、開始感覺有點糟糕、或是開始回到那些低谷時，我發現了這個新的興奮點，我就會使用冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. And it brought me to a new level of feeling good, and excited, and clear.
→ {"text": "它讓我達到了一個新的層次——感覺良好、興奮、清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. And I used it like I used to use drugs, several times a day, as much as I could.
→ {"text": "我使用冥想就像我以前使用毒品一樣，一天好幾次，盡可能多次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. The quantity, the quality was important to me.
→ {"text": "數量和品質對我來說都很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. So I kept using meditation as a tool to help alleviate all that stress and stuff.
→ {"text": "所以我一直將冥想當作一種工具，來幫助減輕所有那些壓力和煩惱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. So that coupled with that contact of people who had passed on.
→ {"text": "所以這結合了與逝去的人的接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. Those were the real focus points of my meditation.
→ {"text": "那些是我冥想的真正焦點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. And the Hemi-Sync took me above and beyond that.
→ {"text": "而半腦同步技術讓我超越了那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

282. And can you describe how it did that?
→ {"text": "你能描述一下它是如何做到的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Or is that something you have to buy the Hemi-Sync and go through?
→ {"text": "還是說那是你必須購買半腦同步技術並親自經歷的東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. Is there--
→ {"text": "有沒有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

285. It's a several step process.
→ {"text": "這是一個多步驟的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. So the teachings are just tools to use.
→ {"text": "所以這些教學只是使用的工具。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. And the vibration sounds, basically, they sync up your hemispheres of the brain.
→ {"text": "而振動聲音，基本上，它們會同步你的大腦半球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

288. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. Yeah, because binaural beats and Hemi-Sync, it's based on the same concept of different tones in different ears.
→ {"text": "對，因為雙耳節拍和半腦同步技術，都是基於在不同耳朵播放不同音調的相同概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

290. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. And some of them, and not Hemi-Sync.
→ {"text": "有些是這樣，但不是半腦同步技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. I used other ones.
→ {"text": "我用過其他的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. But Hemi-Sync was the one that gave me technique.
→ {"text": "但半腦同步技術是給我技巧的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. Those teach you techniques.
→ {"text": "那些教你技巧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

296. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

297. They teach you healing, out-of-body, communication with spirit, all of those.
→ {"text": "他們教你療癒、靈魂出竅、與靈體溝通，所有這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. And with those, I was able to jump through.
→ {"text": "有了這些，我能夠快速進步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. Now, the experiences themselves were so vast, and different kinds of experiences.
→ {"text": "那些體驗本身非常廣闊，有各種不同類型的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. The first day I started, there was a vibration in my body I never felt before.
→ {"text": "我開始的第一天，我的身體裡就有一種我從未感受過的振動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. It made my whole body [BUZZING].
→ {"text": "它讓我的整個身體【嗡嗡作響】。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. And the chakras were just high vibrational.
→ {"text": "脈輪只是處於高振動狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. And those types of experiences were what hooked me in right away.
→ {"text": "這些類型的體驗立刻吸引了我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

304. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

305. I was skeptical, to say the least.
→ {"text": "我當時很懷疑，至少可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. So I started with my first one saying, well, we'll see what it does.
→ {"text": "所以我從第一個開始時心想，好吧，看看它會怎麼樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. And the first one was a hit.
→ {"text": "結果第一個就成功了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. So I just kept going.
→ {"text": "所以我就繼續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

309. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

310. The experience itself-- normally, I suggest to people, if you do the Hemi-Sync, go through it at your own pace.
→ {"text": "這個體驗本身——通常，我會建議人們，如果你要做半腦同步技術，按照你自己的節奏進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. But I would suggest no less than six months, no less than a year to go through all six.
→ {"text": "但我會建議不少於六個月，不少於一年，來完成所有六個課程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. For me, I jumped through them in four months.
→ {"text": "對我來說，我在四個月內就完成了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

313. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

314. And I thought it was way too quick.
→ {"text": "我認為那太快了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. But everything happens for a reason.
→ {"text": "但萬事皆有因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

316. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

317. And it worked out well.
→ {"text": "而且結果很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
