73. Well, it's a bit of a story.
→ {"text": "嗯，這說來話長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. I always love explaining it.
→ {"text": "我一直很喜歡講這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. But first, I was a kid growing up in a family that was really Christian.
→ {"text": "但首先，我從小在一個非常虔誠的基督教家庭長大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. And Christianity was a big, big part of my life as a child, growing up into a younger teenager.
→ {"text": "基督教在我的童年以及青少年早期，是生活中非常、非常重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. At about 13, which is the natural time of rebellion for most, I kind of went through this experience where I separated myself from it.
→ {"text": "大約在 13 歲的時候——這對大多數人來說是自然的叛逆期——我經歷了一種與教會分離的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. Growing up, I had all these questions.
→ {"text": "在成長過程中，我有很多疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. And every time I would ask the preacher or a person esteemed on the board of the church directors, or whoever, just someone who is knowledgeable, they never could really give an answer that was complete to me.
→ {"text": "每次我去問牧師、或教會理事會裡受尊敬的人、或任何有知識的人，他們從來都沒辦法給我一個完整的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. It always seemed like it just went back to, because the Bible says so, or because the church says so.
→ {"text": "答案似乎總是回到「因為聖經是這麼說的」或「因為教會是這麼說的」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. And I had a friend who would go with me.
→ {"text": "我有個朋友會跟我一起去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. And we were both pretty critical of the whole thing.
→ {"text": "我們兩個對整件事都相當批判。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. So after exploring that, I kind of did my own thing.
→ {"text": "所以在探索過這些之後，我開始做自己的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. I let science be a big part of what my reality was at that point.
→ {"text": "我讓科學成為我當時實相中的一大部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. In school, I did pretty well with science.
→ {"text": "在學校裡，我的科學成績還不錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. I enjoyed it.
→ {"text": "我很喜歡科學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. Earth science, especially.
→ {"text": "特別是地球科學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. And going through that time period, I distanced myself more and more from the church.
→ {"text": "在那段時間裡，我與教會的距離越來越遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. After a few years, I just quit going.
→ {"text": "幾年後，我乾脆不去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. And not to my mother's liking either.
→ {"text": "這也不是我母親樂見的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. But we just kept going through.
→ {"text": "但我們就這樣繼續過日子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. And after a few years of just being off and about, I started going through a real, real rebellious stage.
→ {"text": "在隨意遊蕩了幾年之後，我開始進入一個非常、非常叛逆的階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. And that was a very disconnected time in my life.
→ {"text": "那是我生命中非常失連的一段時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. I hung out with a lot of people who-- they did the gang things in the '90s.
→ {"text": "我跟很多人混在一起——他們在 90 年代做那些幫派的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. So violence was part of that.
→ {"text": "所以暴力是其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. Drugs.
→ {"text": "毒品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. All of those things were a big part.
→ {"text": "所有這些東西都是很重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. I started smoking a lot of pot.
→ {"text": "我開始大量抽大麻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. It wasn't an expansive thing.
→ {"text": "這不是什麼擴展意識的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. It was fun.
→ {"text": "這只是為了好玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. So it was in my destructive--
→ {"text": "所以這是在我的自毀——", "confidence": "high", "notes": "句子未完整，被打斷"}


## Speaker Group 4

102. It was a party thing.
→ {"text": "這是派對的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人插話"}


## Speaker Group 5

103. Yes, it was.
→ {"text": "是的，就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

105. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人插話"}

106. Not Native American going into the woods and--
→ {"text": "不是美國原住民那種進到森林裡——", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人調侃，對比靈性用途"}


## Speaker Group 7

107. No drumming circle.
→ {"text": "不是鼓圈儀式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

108. No drumming circle, calling in the Great Spirit Bear.
→ {"text": "不是鼓圈儀式、召喚大靈熊那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

109. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. But there were a lot of bears there, just the wrong kind.
→ {"text": "不過那裡確實有很多熊，只是是錯的那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "bears 雙關，指警察或壯漢"}


## Speaker Group 10

111. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對、對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}


## Speaker Group 11

112. And it was fun.
→ {"text": "那很好玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. And it was violent, destructive.
→ {"text": "也很暴力、很破壞性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. And it was a big part of my life.
→ {"text": "這是我生命中很重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. And I went that way until right around the time before I found out my son was going to be on his way.
→ {"text": "我就這樣一路走下去，直到我發現我兒子要來了之前的那段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And I just kind of quit hanging out with people a few months before then.
→ {"text": "在那之前幾個月，我就不再跟那些人混了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. Maybe it was intuition, looking back.
→ {"text": "回頭看，也許那是直覺吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

118. A big responsibility coming.
→ {"text": "一個大責任要來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人插話"}


## Speaker Group 13

119. Well, it was the first time in my life I looked at an aspect of something that wasn't myself.
→ {"text": "嗯，這是我人生中第一次去看一個不是我自己的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. Everything was centered around myself.
→ {"text": "之前所有東西都是以我自己為中心的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. Even though I had people who I loved and were a part of my life, up until then, it was just me.
→ {"text": "儘管我有愛的人、有在我生命中的人，但直到那時為止，都只有我自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. And knowing this responsibility-- the moment of change really didn't come till the day he was born.
→ {"text": "知道這個責任後——真正改變的時刻其實要到他出生那天才來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. He was born with a lot of physical problems.
→ {"text": "他出生時有很多身體上的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Cerebral palsy.
→ {"text": "腦性麻痺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

125. Did you know that right away, right when he was born?
→ {"text": "你馬上就知道了嗎，就在他出生的時候？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人提問"}


## Speaker Group 15

126. Not to the extent, no.
→ {"text": "不知道有多嚴重，不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. They told us that he had problems.
→ {"text": "他們告訴我們他有問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. So when he came out, he did not have any breath on his own.
→ {"text": "所以當他出來的時候，他沒有自主呼吸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. They had to hook him up to machines.
→ {"text": "他們必須把他接上機器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. So I knew that there was an issue.
→ {"text": "所以我知道有問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. But I didn't know the extent of the issue.
→ {"text": "但我不知道問題有多嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

132. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}


## Speaker Group 17

133. They basically sent us home and said, here's some medicine.
→ {"text": "他們基本上就是讓我們回家，然後說，這是一些藥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. There's a possibility he might have seizures.
→ {"text": "他可能會有癲癇發作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. We've seen some brain waves that weren't normal.
→ {"text": "我們看到一些不正常的腦波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. So they sent me back.
→ {"text": "所以他們就讓我回家了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. And I took care of him.
→ {"text": "然後我照顧他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. And I didn't really know the extent of how bad it was until he started missing all the physical marks. Like they'll say at six months he's supposed to lift his head, and at three months, to do this.
→ {"text": "我真的不知道情況有多糟，直到他開始錯過所有的發展里程碑。比如他們會說六個月大應該要能抬頭，三個月大應該要能做這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. And he missed all of them.
→ {"text": "但他全部都沒達到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

140. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}


## Speaker Group 19

141. When he was about two years old, we took him back to the doctor.
→ {"text": "當他大約兩歲的時候，我們帶他回去看醫生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. And that's when I really knew.
→ {"text": "那時我才真正知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And that's when the depression in myself really started.
→ {"text": "也是那時，我自己的憂鬱症真正開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. That's when the true disconnection that I'd experienced actually happened.
→ {"text": "那時我才真正經歷到真正的失連。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

145. You were disconnected-- just the whole experience, having a son in this state, it was just hard to cope with?
→ {"text": "你感到失連——就是整個經驗，有個處於這種狀態的兒子，這很難承受對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人提問"}


## Speaker Group 21

146. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. It's the thought of knowing.
→ {"text": "就是那種知道的感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And when they tell me, they don't tell me, hey, your son has a problem.
→ {"text": "當他們告訴我時，他們不是說，嘿，你兒子有個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. They're like, he has severe problems.
→ {"text": "他們說的是，他有嚴重的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. He'll never walk.
→ {"text": "他永遠不會走路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. He'll never talk.
→ {"text": "他永遠不會說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. He'll probably be like a vegetable.
→ {"text": "他可能會像個植物人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. And that's pretty much how the doctor explained that.
→ {"text": "醫生基本上就是這樣解釋的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

154. Man.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人反應"}

155. Doctors.
→ {"text": "醫生啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人感嘆"}


## Speaker Group 23

156. Yeah, no bedside manner.
→ {"text": "對，沒有床邊禮儀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Rob 回應"}

157. I know.
→ {"text": "我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人同意"}


## Speaker Group 24

158. And then I guess, they always say, well, we're trained to tell you the worst in case.
→ {"text": "然後我猜，他們總是說，嗯，我們被訓練要告訴你最壞的情況以防萬一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人評論"}

159. And that's not a good training.
→ {"text": "那不是個好的訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

160. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. Well, knowing what we know now and what we thought, it's bad.
→ {"text": "嗯，知道我們現在所知道的，以及我們當時所想的，那很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. So it hit me like a ton of bricks.
→ {"text": "所以那像一噸磚頭砸在我身上一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

163. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}

164. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人重複表達理解"}


## Speaker Group 27

165. It was something that I made myself try to cope with, but I could not on my own.
→ {"text": "這是我讓自己試著去應對的事，但我沒辦法靠自己做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

166. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}


## Speaker Group 29

167. I didn't have any spiritual things in my life.
→ {"text": "我生命中沒有任何靈性的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. Before all I could depend on was pot.
→ {"text": "之前我唯一能依靠的就是大麻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. And that's what helped take the edge off throughout my whole teens and young 20's.
→ {"text": "那就是在我整個青少年時期和二十出頭時幫我緩和痛苦的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. So from the time I found out that my son's mother was pregnant to the time he was two, I had really pulled away from my old lifestyle.
→ {"text": "所以從我發現兒子的媽媽懷孕，到他兩歲這段時間，我真的遠離了我以前的生活方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. But now I immersed back in it triplefold.
→ {"text": "但現在我以三倍的強度重新沉浸回去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. So it was more disconnection than I ever experienced.
→ {"text": "所以那是我經歷過的最嚴重的失連。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. More-- my mind's going crazy all the time.
→ {"text": "更多——我的心智一直在瘋狂運轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. No mental focus whatsoever.
→ {"text": "完全沒有心智專注力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. So I go through that.
→ {"text": "所以我經歷了那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. And it got real bad into the depths of all sorts of things.
→ {"text": "情況變得非常糟，墜入各種事物的深淵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. I even got into severe drug use and pain-- I started with pain management for a car crash I got into, and it spiraled downhill to the worst case scenario.
→ {"text": "我甚至陷入了嚴重的藥物濫用和疼痛——我從車禍後的疼痛管理開始，然後一路螺旋下墜到最糟的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "暗指處方止痛藥成癮"}

178. And after that, I spent many years just kind of existing.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我花了好多年只是存在著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. If I didn't get medicine, I would be sick.
→ {"text": "如果我沒拿到藥，我就會不舒服。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "暗指成癮戒斷症狀"}

180. And my life really did a tilt-a-whirl on me.
→ {"text": "我的人生真的對我來了個天旋地轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

181. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人回應"}


## Speaker Group 31

182. And that was the worst time of my life.
→ {"text": "那是我人生中最糟糕的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. And about seven years into it, maybe less than that, of really bad, bad disconnection depression, I finally started coming out of it.
→ {"text": "大約七年之後，也許更少，在那種非常糟糕、糟糕的失連憂鬱中，我終於開始走出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. And I went through a lot of steps to get there.
→ {"text": "我經歷了很多步驟才走到那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. But the last step included me actually starting to see life again, and starting to see-- and this is when I really honed in on nature, and I honed in on the animals.
→ {"text": "但最後一步包括我真正開始重新看到生命，開始看到——這時我真正專注在大自然上，專注在動物上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. Before I had pets, but I never had an animal that was connected to me.
→ {"text": "之前我有養寵物，但我從來沒有過一隻與我連結的動物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. I'd never seen it as an equal, I'd seen it as property.
→ {"text": "我從來沒把牠視為平等的存在，我把牠視為財產。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. Those little changes subtly creeped in.
→ {"text": "那些小小的改變悄悄地滲透進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. And overnight it was just an amazing difference in perception, an amazing difference in the way I felt.
→ {"text": "然後一夜之間，我的認知就有了驚人的轉變，我的感受方式有了驚人的轉變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. And that's when my true spiritual journey began.
→ {"text": "那時我真正的靈性旅程才開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
