## Speaker Group 349

1158. Well, in addition to TReb, you channel Aridif.
→ {"text": "那麼，除了崔博之外，你還通靈阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 350

1159. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 351

1160. And recently I heard Metatron.
→ {"text": "而且最近我聽說了梅塔特隆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1161. Who else do you channel?
→ {"text": "你還通靈哪些存有呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1162. And then maybe we can get into a little bit of what led up to bringing in these other entities.
→ {"text": "然後也許我們可以聊聊是什麼讓你開始接觸這些其他存有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 352

1163. Sure.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 353

1164. Let's start with Aridif before we get into anybody else.
→ {"text": "在談其他存有之前，我們先從阿里迪夫開始吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 354

1165. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 355

1166. Because he's the other most known.
→ {"text": "因為他是另一位最為人所知的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1167. It's almost like-- lately, have you been channeling Aridif more than TReb?
→ {"text": "感覺好像……最近你通靈阿里迪夫的次數比崔博還多？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 356

1168. Much more.
→ {"text": "多很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1169. Much more than TReb even at this point.
→ {"text": "現在甚至比崔博還要多得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1170. There is a high resonance for him.
→ {"text": "人們對他有很高的共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1171. One of my friends who makes videos, he knows that I'm kind of a modest person in a lot of ways.
→ {"text": "我有個做影片的朋友，他知道我在很多方面都是個謙虛的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1172. And he puts up this thing, "Greatest Channeler In The World on YouTube."
→ {"text": "然後他在 YouTube 上放了個標題，「世界上最偉大的通靈者」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1173. And I said, dude, well, you didn't even tell me.
→ {"text": "我說，老兄，你都沒跟我說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1174. You would have asked me to take it down.
→ {"text": "你會叫我拿掉的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1175. I said, no, I wouldn't have.
→ {"text": "我說，不，我不會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1176. But still.
→ {"text": "但不管怎樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1177. He said something that really clicked with me.
→ {"text": "他說了一句話，讓我真的很有共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1178. He said the wisdom and essence of Bashar, because a lot of people know Bashar as a very wise high energy being, and the heart center of TReb, which TReb's a huge love bucket.
→ {"text": "他說，巴夏的智慧與本質——因為很多人都知道巴夏是一個非常睿智、高頻率的存有——加上崔博的心輪能量，而崔博是個巨大的愛之容器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1179. Everybody loves that.
→ {"text": "每個人都愛這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1180. And he said, that's what Aridif encompasses.
→ {"text": "他說，這就是阿里迪夫所涵蓋的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1181. And that's why Aridif is his favorite channeled being.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼阿里迪夫是他最喜歡的通靈存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1182. So people are dying for Aridif right now.
→ {"text": "所以現在人們非常渴望阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1183. They want to have time with him.
→ {"text": "他們想要有時間跟他相處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1184. They want to hear what he has to say.
→ {"text": "他們想聽聽他要說什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1185. Brilliant, brilliant being.
→ {"text": "非常、非常卓越的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1186. He is to TReb what TReb is to me.
→ {"text": "他之於崔博，就像崔博之於我一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 357

1187. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 358

1188. So like when you look at me, TReb is like maybe a future version of myself.
→ {"text": "所以就像你看我一樣，崔博就像是我未來的某個版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1189. And it could be looked at in a lot of different ways.
→ {"text": "這可以有很多不同的解讀方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1190. But he's like a guide to me.
→ {"text": "但他對我來說就像一個指導者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1191. He's a higher density, higher knowledge being that I pull from.
→ {"text": "他是一個更高密度、更高知識層次的存有，我從他那裡汲取智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 359

1192. TReb is to you.
→ {"text": "崔博對你來說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 360

1193. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1194. TReb, for my information and energy.
→ {"text": "崔博，為我提供訊息和能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1195. And TReb does that with Aridif.
→ {"text": "而崔博就是從阿里迪夫那裡獲得這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1196. TReb's a fifth density being.
→ {"text": "崔博是第五密度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1197. And Aridif's a sixth density being.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫是第六密度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1198. So energetically, it's a higher energy.
→ {"text": "所以從能量上來說，那是更高的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 361

1199. And do TReb and Aridif-- I assume, they do communicate?
→ {"text": "那崔博和阿里迪夫——我想，他們有互相交流吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1200. They know each other?
→ {"text": "他們認識彼此？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 362

1201. They know each other well.
→ {"text": "他們彼此非常熟識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1202. I had heard stories about Aridif before I ever connected with him.
→ {"text": "在我真正連接上阿里迪夫之前，我就聽過關於他的故事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1203. Back when I heard it-- because most of these entities don't have names of their own, they just have energy.
→ {"text": "當時我聽到時——因為大多數這些實體本身沒有名字，他們只有能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 363

1204. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 364

1205. And they give us names, because we're humans, and we need names to identify.
→ {"text": "他們給我們名字，因為我們是人類，我們需要名字來辨識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1206. So TReb would talk about a being called Deneb Cygnus.
→ {"text": "所以崔博會談到一個叫做天鵝座天津四的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1207. And that's the Deneb, like the star Deneb, and Cygnus, the constellation of the Swan.
→ {"text": "那就是天津四，就像天津四這顆星，還有天鵝座，天鵝星座。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1208. And he said, this entity named Deneb Cygnus, and then he would tell a story about him, or tell a story about information that Deneb Cygnus had shared with him.
→ {"text": "他會說，這個名叫天鵝座天津四的實體，然後講述關於他的故事，或是講述天鵝座天津四分享給他的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1209. Well, eventually, I found out through the book that I did about TReb and his people, that that was Aridif.
→ {"text": "後來，我透過我寫的關於崔博和他族群的書發現，那就是阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1210. And Aridif gives us that name.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫給了我們這個名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1211. Aridif used that name with humans a long time ago.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫很久以前就用這個名字與人類互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1212. Let me-- yeah, and I'm jumping ahead of myself.
→ {"text": "讓我——嗯，我有點講太快了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1213. So let me give a little introduction to Aridif.
→ {"text": "所以讓我稍微介紹一下阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1214. Aridif is an Ancient Pleiadian entity, but he lives in the star called Deneb.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫是古昴宿星人實體，但他住在一顆叫做天津四的星星裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1215. His race moved out of the Pleiades star system, which tens of thousands of races live there.
→ {"text": "他的族群從昴宿星系統搬出來了，那裡住著數以萬計的種族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1216. They pulled their race out, because energetically, they needed a different-- he explained it as, we needed room to grow.
→ {"text": "他們把自己的族群遷出，因為從能量上來說，他們需要不同的——他解釋為，我們需要成長的空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1217. But what I think is the collective consciousness of a race is very similar to a star.
→ {"text": "但我認為，一個種族的集體意識與一顆恆星非常相似。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1218. And in fact, that's why they incorporate so much energy.
→ {"text": "事實上，這就是為什麼他們能容納這麼多能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1219. If it's a smaller collective, it only needs a little space to grow.
→ {"text": "如果是較小的集體，它只需要一點成長空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1220. But when you have these huge consciousnesses and you have a lot of them, they need energetic space.
→ {"text": "但當你有這些巨大的意識體，而且數量很多時，他們就需要能量空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1221. And that is shown by the star that they travel around.
→ {"text": "這可以從他們繞行的恆星看出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1222. And Deneb is this gigantic, huge, supermassive, like 150 times the size of our sun.
→ {"text": "而天津四是這顆巨大、龐大、超大質量的恆星，大約是我們太陽的 150 倍大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1223. And that's where his race needed to go, because they grew into that.
→ {"text": "那就是他的族群需要去的地方，因為他們成長到了那個程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1224. They sprung into a huge-- and when you listen to Aridif, you can tell more than just his sentient energy, more than his wisdom, he's just huge expanded.
→ {"text": "他們躍升到一個巨大的——當你聆聽阿里迪夫時，你能感受到的不只是他的智慧能量，不只是他的智慧，他就是巨大的擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1225. They're at the level right before you leave physical reality altogether and join the oversoul energy back in the planetary collective.
→ {"text": "他們處於完全離開物質實相、回歸超靈能量、重新加入行星集體之前的最後階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1226. So I mean he's this huge being.
→ {"text": "所以我的意思是，他是這樣一個巨大的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1227. And now they inhabit this star.
→ {"text": "現在他們居住在這顆星星裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1228. And a lot of people ask about-- they don't know what he looks like.
→ {"text": "很多人會問——他們不知道他長什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1229. And there's some art out there of him, and it's beautiful.
→ {"text": "外面有一些關於他的藝術作品，非常美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1230. Kalina did art too.
→ {"text": "卡莉娜也畫過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1231. She's been able to see him too in her mind's eye.
→ {"text": "她也能在心靈之眼中看到他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1232. Never TReb, but Aridif.
→ {"text": "從未見過崔博，但見過阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1233. They had a past life where she had met Aridif when he physically came to Earth.
→ {"text": "他們有一個前世，當時阿里迪夫以物質形態來到地球時，她曾遇見他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 365

1234. When he was Deneb.
→ {"text": "當他是天津四的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 366

1235. Back in ancient Egypt.
→ {"text": "回到古埃及時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 367

1236. When he was known as Deneb?
→ {"text": "當他被稱為天津四的時候？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 368

1237. Well, no.
→ {"text": "呃，不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1238. The Aridif name was one that was known to Earth, but TReb never gave me that identity until later.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫這個名字是地球知道的名字，但崔博直到後來才告訴我那個身分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1239. So he was still known as Aridif when I first heard of him, but TReb, for whatever reason, gave me the Deneb Cygnus name.
→ {"text": "所以當我第一次聽說他時，他仍然被稱為阿里迪夫，但崔博出於某種原因給了我天鵝座天津四這個名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 369

1240. So back in the Egyptian days, he was known as Aridif as well?
→ {"text": "所以回到埃及時代，他也被稱為阿里迪夫？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 370

1241. Well, he said the name came from the era and how they knew him.
→ {"text": "嗯，他說這個名字來自那個時代以及他們如何認識他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1242. So maybe they knew what star he came from, and back then they might have called it Aridif.
→ {"text": "所以也許他們知道他來自哪顆星，而那時候他們可能就稱那顆星為阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 371

1243. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 372

1244. I still don't know the specifics, but I think that's what it is.
→ {"text": "我仍然不知道具體細節，但我認為就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 373

1245. So maybe in Egyptian times, that's what they called them.
→ {"text": "所以也許在埃及時代，他們就這樣稱呼他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 374

1246. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 375

1247. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 376

1248. And he hung out with Egyptians.
→ {"text": "他曾與埃及人相處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1249. He just recently alluded to the fact that he had hung out with South African tribes, that he hung out with Egyptians, that he hung out with Indians, and some Southern American tribes.
→ {"text": "他最近提到，他曾與南非部落相處，與埃及人相處，與印度人相處，還有一些南美洲部落。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1250. So he has been on the Earth manifested as a physical being in order to co-create with Earth before, kind of like an energetic quarantine, where it was kind of interference.
→ {"text": "所以他曾經以物質存有的形態顯化在地球上，為了與地球共同創造，有點像是一種能量隔離，某種程度上是一種干預。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1251. And that's a difficult, long subject to get into.
→ {"text": "這是個很難深入討論的長遠主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1252. But he has co-created with humans.
→ {"text": "但他確實與人類共同創造過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1253. And I think that him understanding humanity before he came here, even though it was a much older version, gave him a great opportunity when he teaches to have it really resonate with people.
→ {"text": "我認為，他在來到這裡之前就了解人類——儘管是更古老的版本——這讓他在教導時能真正與人們產生共鳴，這是一個很好的機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1254. Plus the amount of wisdom that comes out of him is ungodly.
→ {"text": "而且從他那裡流露出的智慧量是驚人的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1255. It's just beautiful.
→ {"text": "真的很美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 377

1256. So Aridif used to interact with the human race back in the day; South Africans, Egyptians, probably more.
→ {"text": "所以阿里迪夫過去曾與人類互動；南非人、埃及人，可能還有更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1257. But has it been a while then?
→ {"text": "但那已經是很久以前的事了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1258. Is this like his-- he took a break, and now he's back.
→ {"text": "這是不是像他——他休息了一段時間，現在又回來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1259. And humanity is like, oh, wow, look at humanity.
→ {"text": "然後看到人類現在的樣子，就像，哇，看看人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1260. Or has he been constantly monitoring?
→ {"text": "還是他一直在持續監看？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1261. And do other people channel Aridif?
→ {"text": "還有其他人通靈阿里迪夫嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 378

1262. From what I know, no one else has.
→ {"text": "據我所知，沒有其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1263. Some people said that his energy is familiar.
→ {"text": "有些人說他的能量很熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1264. So I don't know.
→ {"text": "所以我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1265. But I do know that he's been interacting with humans for a long time.
→ {"text": "但我確實知道他與人類互動已經很長一段時間了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1266. It's been thousands of years, he said, before he's reconnected.
→ {"text": "他說，在他重新連接之前，已經過了數千年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1267. And even now he's not physically connecting.
→ {"text": "即使現在，他也不是以物質形式連接。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 379

1268. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 380

1269. Right now, it's an important growth time for humans.
→ {"text": "現在是人類成長的重要時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1270. And a lot of the hands-on interactions are not appreciated by some of the ETs.
→ {"text": "而許多親身互動並不被某些外星人所認同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1271. For instance, type 1 and type 2, this is the definition Aridif and TReb have given.
→ {"text": "例如，第一類型和第二類型，這是阿里迪夫和崔博給出的定義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1272. Type 1, they'll do it in the way that TReb and Aridif are.
→ {"text": "第一類型，他們會以崔博和阿里迪夫的方式來做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 381

1273. Type 1 civilization or type 1 ET?
→ {"text": "第一類型文明還是第一類型外星人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 382

1274. Type 1 extraterrestrial kind, energetic kind.
→ {"text": "第一類型外星人種類，能量種類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 383

1275. And what is--
→ {"text": "那什麼是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 384

1276. A type 1 defined is an entity who respects the free will of all things, will not interfere.
→ {"text": "第一類型的定義是尊重萬物自由意志的實體，不會干涉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 385

1277. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 386

1278. And looks above and below them, energetically speaking.
→ {"text": "並且從能量角度來說，會向上和向下看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1279. They look above them for inspiration, wisdom, to incorporate.
→ {"text": "他們向上看，尋求靈感、智慧，以便吸收。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1280. And then below them to redistribute that information.
→ {"text": "然後向下看，重新分配那些訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1281. They see themselves as a part of one.
→ {"text": "他們視自己為一體的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 387

1282. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 388

1283. A type 2 sees division.
→ {"text": "第二類型看到的是分裂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1284. A type 2 being only looks below them for what they can overpower or oversee.
→ {"text": "第二類型存有只向下看，看他們能掌控或監管什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1285. They never look above them.
→ {"text": "他們從不向上看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1286. They look equal or below to them, energetically speaking.
→ {"text": "從能量角度來說，他們只看平等或低於他們的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1287. They also are not afraid to interject themselves on the behalf of themselves or others.
→ {"text": "他們也不怕為了自己或他人而插手干預。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1288. For instance, a lot of these channeled entities that have come out are talking about, we are going to help you.
→ {"text": "例如，許多這些被通靈的實體會說，我們要來幫助你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1289. We're going to do this for you.
→ {"text": "我們要為你們做這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1290. We're going to do that for you.
→ {"text": "我們要為你們做那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1291. They're doing that, because-- some of them with great intent.
→ {"text": "他們這樣做，是因為——有些是出於好意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1292. They are like, we love you.
→ {"text": "他們會說，我們愛你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1293. You're messing up.
→ {"text": "你們搞砸了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1294. We want to help you.
→ {"text": "我們想要幫助你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1295. But in their mind, they know better than we do.
→ {"text": "但在他們心智中，他們覺得自己比我們更懂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1296. And Aridif and TReb come from a place that you guys manifest what you want as a collective, because that is what you want.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫和崔博來自這樣一個立場：你們作為集體顯化你們想要的，因為那就是你們想要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1297. And we will respect your journey.
→ {"text": "我們會尊重你們的旅程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1298. Even if you nuke yourself to oblivion, we will respect it.
→ {"text": "即使你們用核彈把自己炸到湮滅，我們也會尊重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1299. And we will never step in the way.
→ {"text": "我們永遠不會插手干預。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1300. Because they know it's a soul's journey.
→ {"text": "因為他們知道這是靈魂的旅程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1301. The other entities look at it as a physical thing, or even a soul level, just at a different interval.
→ {"text": "其他實體把這看成是物質層面的事，或甚至是靈魂層面的，只是在不同的時間段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1302. So these are the fundamental differences.
→ {"text": "所以這些就是根本的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1303. And back when Aridif did interact with humans, he did it from his incarnation now, but he also has done it from previous incarnations of his Denebian race.
→ {"text": "而當阿里迪夫與人類互動時，他不僅是從現在的轉世中這麼做，也在他天津四族群的前世轉世中這麼做過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1304. So in that way--
→ {"text": "所以在那種情況下——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 389

1305. Denebian race.
→ {"text": "天津四族群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 390

1306. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1307. And Ancient Pleiadians is what we call it, because that's how he introduced themselves.
