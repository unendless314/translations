## Speaker Group 265

808. This is fascinating.

809. I feel like we don't even need to channel.
→ {"text": "我覺得我們甚至不需要通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

810. We can just talk all day about this world.
→ {"text": "我們可以整天談論這個世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

811. There's been some worlds that I've seen too before.
→ {"text": "我之前也見過一些世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

812. I have talked to people, like CGI artists, and said, I want to describe this to you and make it, but it's such a process.
→ {"text": "我和一些人談過，像是 CGI 藝術家，我說，我想向你描述這個並製作出來，但這是個漫長的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

813. And nobody has an interest in doing it, unless there's money involved with it.
→ {"text": "而且除非有錢，否則沒有人有興趣做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

814. The few people who've done artwork for us usually do the entities that I channel, like TReb or Aridif.
→ {"text": "為我們做過藝術作品的少數人通常會畫我通靈的存有，像崔博或阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

815. Vashta does those, and Eduardo.
→ {"text": "Vashta 和 Eduardo 做過這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

816. Do you think then when CGI artists-- I used to run a visual effects company, so I know some of these model makers come out with these fascinating designs-- do you think they're actually tapping into some alternate planetary consciousness out there as opposed to it being originally created, or maybe pieces of different planetary consciousnesses?
→ {"text": "那你認為當 CGI 藝術家——我曾經經營一家視覺特效公司，所以我知道這些模型製作者會創造出這些迷人的設計——你認為他們實際上是在連接某些外星行星意識，而不是原創的，或者可能是不同行星意識的片段？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

817. I guarantee they're channeling 90% or more of it.
→ {"text": "我保證他們 90% 或更多是在通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

818. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

819. They're even-- and it's something like it's a conundrum where is it that everything exists, or is it that this universe is so big, that it has to exist somewhere?
→ {"text": "他們甚至——這就像一個謎題，是所有事物都存在，還是這個宇宙如此之大，以至於它必須存在於某處？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

820. Or is it just whatever you think, you create?
→ {"text": "還是你想到什麼，你就創造什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

821. It doesn't really matter, because what they're doing is real.
→ {"text": "這其實不重要，因為他們所做的是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

822. I've seen some of the special effects stuff that people have done in movies or video games.
→ {"text": "我看過一些人在電影或電玩遊戲中做的特效。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

823. And it's like, I've seen something almost exactly like that, or something very similar.
→ {"text": "就像，我見過幾乎一模一樣的東西，或者非常相似的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

824. Enough where you couldn't notice the difference to someone who doesn't live there.
→ {"text": "相似到如果你不住在那裡，你根本注意不到差別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

825. Right. Wow.
→ {"text": "對。哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

826. So it's truly inspiration.
→ {"text": "所以這真的是靈感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

827. That imagination part of us is us tapping into that.
→ {"text": "我們的想像力部分就是我們在連接那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

828. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

829. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "太迷人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

830. So you spend two years going to this world, having these conversations.
→ {"text": "所以你花了兩年時間去這個世界，進行這些對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

831. And it's your idea then to finally talk to TReb and say, hey, why don't we try this whole channeling thing?
→ {"text": "然後是你的主意最後跟崔博說，嘿，我們為什麼不試試整個通靈這件事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

832. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

833. And what does he say?
→ {"text": "那他怎麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

834. Of course, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "我確定他當然同意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

835. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

836. He said, yeah.
→ {"text": "他說，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

837. That's one of the paths we can take.
→ {"text": "這是我們可以走的路徑之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

838. Awesome.
→ {"text": "太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

839. And did he give you tips on how to do it?
→ {"text": "那他有給你怎麼做的提示嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

840. Or were you, by this time, versed enough to say, OK, this is what we've got to do, TReb.
→ {"text": "還是你到這時候已經夠熟練，可以說，好，這就是我們要做的，崔博。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

841. How did that work?
→ {"text": "那是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

842. No, it's actually a combination of the two.
→ {"text": "不，實際上是兩者的結合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

843. And it was never me going, hey, I think this will work.
→ {"text": "而且從來不是我說，嘿，我想這會有用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

844. I went out on the internet.
→ {"text": "我上網搜尋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

845. Obviously, the internet was great.
→ {"text": "顯然，網路很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

846. There wasn't a lot of stuff there.
→ {"text": "那裡沒有很多東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

847. So I searched out psychic mediums.
→ {"text": "所以我搜尋靈媒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

848. I knew a guy who worked with the team of the "Law of One" material, that after the "Law Of One" material was written, he worked closely with the main channeler there, Carla Rueckert.
→ {"text": "我認識一個人，他與《一的法則》團隊合作過，在《一的法則》資料寫成之後，他與那裡的主要通靈者卡拉·魯克特密切合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

849. So I worked with him and talked to him.
→ {"text": "所以我和他合作並與他交談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

850. And he gave me a lot of really great information.
→ {"text": "他給了我很多非常好的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

851. I had looked up online a couple of channeling books.
→ {"text": "我在網上查過幾本通靈的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

852. And now I realize, probably, some of the same people that I'm aware of today and just didn't know was them back then.
→ {"text": "現在我意識到，可能是我今天知道的同一批人，只是當時不知道是他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

853. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

854. And worked with TReb.
→ {"text": "並與崔博合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

855. And TReb helped me out with a lot.
→ {"text": "崔博幫了我很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

856. And then I just kind of borrowed a little from everything until it was perfect.
→ {"text": "然後我就從每樣東西中借用一點，直到完美為止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

857. And then I found my own mix.
→ {"text": "然後我找到了自己的組合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

858. It was a garden variety of a little bit of everything.
→ {"text": "這是各種東西的大雜燴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

859. What got you through?
→ {"text": "什麼讓你成功的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

860. What was the catalyst to bring TReb through?
→ {"text": "讓崔博降臨的催化劑是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

861. What was your first channeling experience, I guess?
→ {"text": "我猜你第一次通靈的經驗是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

862. Well, my first channeling experience, I set up a camera.
→ {"text": "嗯，我第一次通靈的經驗，我架設了一台相機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

863. My then wife was there to kind of monitor me and make sure nothing went too crazy.
→ {"text": "我當時的妻子在那裡監督我，確保沒有太瘋狂的事情發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

864. That was a concern of mine.
→ {"text": "那是我的顧慮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

865. I got this entity coming in my body.
→ {"text": "我讓這個實體進入我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

866. I don't want to lose control or-- you know, the Christian part of my mind...
→ {"text": "我不想失去控制或者——你知道，我心智中的基督教部分……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

867. Hulk out!
→ {"text": "變成綠巨人！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

868. You have this big green alien coming through you, you might. Did that ever go through you mind?
→ {"text": "你有這個大綠色外星人穿過你，你可能會。這有沒有在你腦海中出現過？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

869. A little bit of that.
→ {"text": "有一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

870. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

871. At that point, I trusted TReb.
→ {"text": "當時，我信任崔博。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

872. I'd come to love him like a dear friend.
→ {"text": "我已經愛他如親密朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

873. But there's still the unknown.
→ {"text": "但仍有未知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

874. Why would this entity come and choose me out of everybody?
→ {"text": "為什麼這個實體會來並從所有人中選擇我？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

875. Why?
→ {"text": "為什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

876. My Christian beliefs tapped on my shoulder a few times.
→ {"text": "我的基督教信仰拍了我的肩膀幾次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

877. So I wanted to be careful.
→ {"text": "所以我想要小心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

878. I wanted to be good.
→ {"text": "我想要做對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

879. I recorded myself, and it was amazingly horrible.
→ {"text": "我錄下了自己，結果糟糕透頂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

880. Amazingly horrible.
→ {"text": "糟糕透頂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

881. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

882. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

883. Can you describe amazingly horrible?
→ {"text": "你能描述糟糕透頂是什麼樣子嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

884. Yes.
→ {"text": "可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

885. The voice that people hear TReb now, even if they go back four years, it's not the same.
→ {"text": "現在人們聽到崔博的聲音，即使他們回到四年前，也不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

886. It's a little different.
→ {"text": "有一點不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

887. And the accent's the same, the type of talking that he uses.
→ {"text": "口音是一樣的，他使用的說話類型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

888. But the inflections are different.
→ {"text": "但語調不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

889. And the yeses are much more vibrant.
→ {"text": "而且「是的」更有活力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

890. And like when he says, yes-- that "ye-e-e-s", really excited-- that wasn't there then.
→ {"text": "而且像他說，是的——那個「是——的」，非常興奮——當時還沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

891. It was very flat and monotone, and kind of filtery too.
→ {"text": "非常平淡單調，而且有點像被過濾過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

892. There was just-- I could tell all of TReb wasn't getting in.
→ {"text": "就是——我可以看出崔博的全部沒有進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

893. So I practiced a few more times.
→ {"text": "所以我又練習了幾次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

894. But when you get to know me, you know about me, I don't wait for anything.
→ {"text": "但當你了解我，你知道我，我不會等任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

895. I don't wait till everything's perfect.
→ {"text": "我不會等到一切都完美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

896. I just jump headfirst, fly by the seat of my pants.
→ {"text": "我就是頭先跳，憑直覺行事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

897. So I immediately went to the YouTube waves.
→ {"text": "所以我立即上傳到 YouTube。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

898. I want to share this.
→ {"text": "我想分享這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

899. And my first channeling was actually a lot better.
→ {"text": "而我第一次通靈實際上好多了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

900. In the couple of times I had tried between then, I probably only did maybe 6 to 10 channelings between the first one and the one I put on YouTube.
→ {"text": "在那之間我嘗試的幾次，我可能只做了大概 6 到 10 次通靈，在第一次和我上傳到 YouTube 的那次之間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

901. And when you describe 6 to 10 channelings, or six channelings or so before you-- and you're recording yourself, are you asking questions?
→ {"text": "當你描述 6 到 10 次通靈，或大約六次通靈在你——而你在錄製自己，你在問問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

902. Is it just you in the room?
→ {"text": "房間裡只有你一個人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

903. I mean, how do you-- is there somebody else?
→ {"text": "我的意思是，你怎麼——有其他人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

904. Well, you said your wife-- is she there to help facilitate?
→ {"text": "嗯，你說你的妻子——她在那裡幫忙促進嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

905. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

906. At that point, the first couple ones was just letting TReb talk.
→ {"text": "當時，前幾次只是讓崔博說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

907. I told him, you just come through and say what you want to say.
→ {"text": "我告訴他，你就降臨並說你想說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

908. I'll share something.
→ {"text": "我會分享一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

909. If it's usable, we can put it on YouTube.
→ {"text": "如果可以用，我們就可以放到 YouTube 上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

910. So address people.
→ {"text": "所以對人們說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

911. And that's the first couple of times.
→ {"text": "那是前幾次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

912. And then after that, my then wife would ask a few questions.
→ {"text": "然後在那之後，我當時的妻子會問幾個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

913. I let one of my friends try.
→ {"text": "我讓我的一個朋友試試。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

914. So it was basically trial and error, just playing around the first time.
→ {"text": "所以基本上是試錯，第一次只是玩玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

915. So I guess the information was still good.
→ {"text": "所以我猜資訊仍然是好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

916. It was just-- you say when it was horrible, it wasn't the information was horrible.
→ {"text": "只是——你說當它很糟糕時，不是資訊很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

917. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

918. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

919. And some of the information came through a little odd, just the verbiage on it was weird.
→ {"text": "而且一些資訊傳來有點奇怪，只是措辭很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

920. You could tell it was like having someone who first learned how to speak English be able to talk.
→ {"text": "你可以看出這就像讓一個剛學會說英語的人說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

921. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

922. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

923. Well, that's what I was wondering.
→ {"text": "嗯，那就是我想知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

924. And maybe this is a question for TReb later.
→ {"text": "也許這是稍後問崔博的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

925. Does he have to learn English?
→ {"text": "他必須學英語嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

926. Or is it all translated by you via vibrational translations, vibrational frequencies?
→ {"text": "還是全部由你通過振動翻譯、振動頻率來翻譯？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

927. My best understanding is that, basically-- like when I go to channel, I'm using the same techniques in a quicker way than I used to when I would leave my physical body.
→ {"text": "我最好的理解是，基本上——就像當我去通靈時，我使用與以前離開物質身體時相同的技術，只是更快的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

928. So I'm leaving, and part of TReb comes in.
→ {"text": "所以我離開，崔博的一部分進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

929. So when he's in, he's mixing his energy with mine.
→ {"text": "所以當他進來時，他將他的能量與我的混合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

930. So it's running through my chakra systems, but also accessing the brain part.
→ {"text": "所以它通過我的脈輪系統運行，但也存取大腦部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

931. And in that brain part is the whole English language, my experiences, all of my personality.
→ {"text": "而在那個大腦部分是整個英語語言、我的經驗、我的所有人格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

932. So he has the opportunity to access that.
→ {"text": "所以他有機會存取那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

933. So English, it wasn't that the English was bad, because he knew English by knowing my mind.
→ {"text": "所以英語，不是英語不好，因為他通過了解我的心智而知道英語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

934. It was the way of trying to express it.
→ {"text": "而是試圖表達它的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

935. Like Aridif and TReb, still to this day, sometimes they might get hung up on a word, so they'll stop.
→ {"text": "就像阿里迪夫和崔博，直到今天，有時他們可能會卡在一個詞上，所以他們會停下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

936. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

937. And they'll search for the word or find one that's as compatible as they can.
→ {"text": "然後他們會搜尋這個詞，或找一個盡可能兼容的詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

938. So sometimes when-- like the one that's most known, Aridif, when he says, you must do this, he's not saying, you have to do this.
→ {"text": "所以有時候——就像最知名的那個，阿里迪夫，當他說，你必須做這個，他不是說，你不得不做這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

939. He's saying, if you want what you're desiring, this is the best way.
→ {"text": "他是說，如果你想要你渴望的，這是最好的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

940. Right
→ {"text": "對", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

941. So little things like that.
→ {"text": "所以像那樣的小事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

942. But then it was much more disproportional than it is now.
→ {"text": "但當時它比現在不成比例得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

943. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

944. So it was more of a translation glitch--
→ {"text": "所以這更像是翻譯故障——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

945. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

946. Than an actual understanding of the language or knowing the language.
→ {"text": "而不是實際理解語言或知道語言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

947. It's not necessarily what's happening.
→ {"text": "不一定是正在發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

948. It's not like he went and had to take a course in English 101.
→ {"text": "不像他去上英語 101 課程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

949. That would be rough.
→ {"text": "那會很辛苦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

950. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

951. But yeah, absolutely.
→ {"text": "但對，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

952. It's a translational vibrational thing.
→ {"text": "這是一種翻譯振動的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

953. My vibration at the time, it wasn't what it is now.
→ {"text": "我當時的頻率，不是現在的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

954. I was learning all this cool stuff, but I hadn't applied very much of it.
→ {"text": "我正在學習所有這些很酷的東西，但我還沒有應用很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

955. What I did learn and applied helped.
→ {"text": "我學到並應用的幫助了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

956. And it was really six months--
→ {"text": "而真的是六個月——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

957. In some way, you're translating too.
→ {"text": "在某種程度上，你也在翻譯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

958. You have to raise your level.
→ {"text": "你必須提高你的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

959. He has to bring his level down.
→ {"text": "他必須降低他的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

960. So there has to be this kind of-- and then there's a growth, I'm assuming, since then.
→ {"text": "所以必須有這種——然後我假設，從那時起有成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

961. Like you said, it's gotten better.
→ {"text": "就像你說的，它變得更好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

962. So you're able to meet each other's frequencies.
→ {"text": "所以你們能夠相遇彼此的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

963. You're going up there, him coming down here.
→ {"text": "你往上走，他往下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

964. So that's evolved over the years.
→ {"text": "所以這在多年來已經演化了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

965. Yes, absolutely.
→ {"text": "是的，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

966. That's the perfect way, too, to explain that.
→ {"text": "那也是解釋這個的完美方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

967. It's something where it's amalgamation of two consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "這是兩個意識的融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

968. And it's a concerted effort on both of our parts to co-create that.
→ {"text": "這是我們雙方共同創造的協同努力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

969. And I couldn't get up to him.
→ {"text": "而我無法上升到他那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

970. He could always come down to me, but I just couldn't get up to him.
→ {"text": "他總是可以下降到我這裡，但我就是無法上升到他那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

971. And the more I channeled, the more I felt his energy.
→ {"text": "我通靈越多，我越感受到他的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

972. And the more I felt his energy, the easier it was for me to integrate certain parts of the teachings.
→ {"text": "我越感受到他的能量，我越容易整合教導的某些部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

973. And in the teachings, a lot of the stuff about self-creation, relaxing, the way to perceive reality started clicking easier.
→ {"text": "而在教導中，很多關於自我創造、放鬆、感知實相的方式開始更容易理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

974. So after the first six months of channeling, I was 10 times better than the first one.
→ {"text": "所以在通靈的前六個月之後，我比第一次好 10 倍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

975. And in the first year of channeling, I was 10 times better than that.
→ {"text": "而在通靈的第一年，我比那又好 10 倍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

976. And it kept going.
→ {"text": "而且持續進步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

977. And it's like any job that any person does with their motor skills.
→ {"text": "就像任何人做任何工作的肌肉記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

978. Muscle memory comes into play.
→ {"text": "肌肉記憶開始發揮作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

979. Well, this is energetic muscle memory.
→ {"text": "嗯，這是能量肌肉記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

980. And that's how it's applied.
→ {"text": "這就是它的應用方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

981. It's the more you do and repeat, the better you are at it.
→ {"text": "你做得越多、重複越多，你就越擅長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

982. And that's why even to this day, I get better at channeling.

## Speaker Group 309

983. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

984. This time last year, channeling was great.
→ {"text": "去年這個時候，通靈很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

985. It was smooth.
→ {"text": "很順暢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

986. People resonated with it, but now it's a whole new level.
→ {"text": "人們與之共鳴，但現在是全新的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

987. And this is why you see the veterans out there who've channeled their entire life; Darryl Anka, and Nora, and Wendy.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼你看到那些老將，他們通靈了一輩子；達瑞爾·安卡、Nora 和 Wendy。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

988. All those great channelers, they've been doing that forever.
→ {"text": "所有那些偉大的通靈者，他們一直這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

989. It's their connection.
→ {"text": "這是他們的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

990. TReb and Aridif actually have a term for it.
→ {"text": "崔博和阿里迪夫實際上有一個術語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

991. It's called building a bridge.
→ {"text": "叫做建立橋樑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

992. And each time you channel, you're putting a new peg in, or a new screw, or a new plate of metal.
→ {"text": "每次你通靈，你都在放入一個新的釘子，或新的螺絲，或新的金屬板。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

993. And the bigger the piece comes, it's the bigger realizations you have in yourself.
→ {"text": "而越大的部分到來，你在自己身上有越大的領悟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

994. I had points in my channeling where I didn't learn anything.
→ {"text": "我在通靈中有幾次沒有學到任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

995. Whenever I'd listen back to a session, I was like, I already knew that.
→ {"text": "每當我回聽一個節目時，我會想，我已經知道了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

996. But when I started really learning things about my own life on my own terms, then it would shine through on the channeling.
→ {"text": "但當我開始真正以自己的方式學習關於我自己生活的事情時，它就會在通靈中閃耀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

997. And then it would open up more synchronicities.
→ {"text": "然後它會打開更多同步性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

998. And it wasn't that the information wasn't new.
→ {"text": "不是資訊不是新的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

999. It's just the way I perceived it was old.
→ {"text": "只是我感知它的方式是舊的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1000. So when I changed my perceptions and my energy grew, that allowed that energy to come in a lot better with understandings and synchronicities to apply itself.
→ {"text": "所以當我改變我的感知，我的能量增長時，那允許那個能量以更好的理解和同步性進入，應用自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

1001. So would that make the channeling then better, better, more defined, or in a better-- more terminology?
→ {"text": "那會讓通靈變得更好、更好、更明確，還是更好——更多術語？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1002. Or because you were able to have that perspective on it, did you think that helped the channeling?
→ {"text": "還是因為你能夠對此有那種觀點，你認為這有助於通靈？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
