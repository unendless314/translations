## Speaker Group 356

1170. Well, in addition to TReb, you channel Aridif.
→ {"text": "嗯，除了崔博（TReb）之外，你還通靈阿里迪夫（Aridif）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 357

1171. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 358

1172. And recently I heard Metatron.
→ {"text": "而且最近我聽到梅塔特隆（Metatron）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1173. Who else do you channel?
→ {"text": "你還通靈誰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1174. And then maybe we can get into a little bit of what led up to bringing in these other entities.
→ {"text": "然後也許我們可以聊聊是什麼引導你接觸到這些其他實體的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 359

1175. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 360

1176. Let's start with Aridif before we get into anybody else.
→ {"text": "我們先從阿里迪夫開始，然後再談其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 361

1177. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 362

1178. Because he's the other most known.
→ {"text": "因為他是另一個最為人所知的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1179. It's almost like-- lately, have you been channeling Aridif more than TReb?
→ {"text": "感覺好像——最近你通靈阿里迪夫的次數比崔博還多？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 363

1180. Much more.
→ {"text": "多得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1181. Much more than TReb even at this point.
→ {"text": "在這個階段，甚至比崔博還多得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1182. There is a high resonance for him.
→ {"text": "人們對他有很高的共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1183. One of my friends who makes videos, he knows that I'm kind of a modest person in a lot of ways.
→ {"text": "我有個做影片的朋友，他知道我在很多方面都是個蠻謙虛的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1184. And he puts up this thing, "Greatest Channeler In The World on YouTube."
→ {"text": "然後他放上這個標題:「YouTube 上世界最偉大的通靈者」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1185. And I said, dude, well, you didn't even tell me.
→ {"text": "然後我說，兄弟，你都沒跟我說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1186. You would have asked me to take it down.
→ {"text": "你會要我把它撤下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1187. I said, no, I wouldn't have.
→ {"text": "我說，不，我不會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1188. But still.
→ {"text": "但還是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1189. He said something that really clicked with me.
→ {"text": "他說了一些真的讓我產生共鳴的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1190. He said the wisdom and essence of Bashar, because a lot of people know Bashar as a very wise high energy being, and the heart center of TReb, which TReb's a huge love bucket.
→ {"text": "他說，阿里迪夫擁有巴夏(Bashar)的智慧與本質——因為很多人都知道巴夏是一個非常有智慧的高能量存有——以及崔博的心輪中心，而崔博是個巨大的愛之容器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1191. Everybody loves that.
→ {"text": "大家都喜歡這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1192. And he said, that's what Aridif encompasses.
→ {"text": "他說，這就是阿里迪夫所涵蓋的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1193. And that's why Aridif is his favorite channeled being.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼阿里迪夫是他最喜歡的通靈存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1194. So people are dying for Aridif right now.
→ {"text": "所以人們現在非常渴望阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1195. They want to have time with him.
→ {"text": "他們想要與他相處的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1196. They want to hear what he has to say.
→ {"text": "他們想聽他說什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1197. Brilliant, brilliant being.
→ {"text": "非常、非常出色的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1198. He is to TReb what TReb is to me.
→ {"text": "他對崔博，就像崔博對我一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 364

1199. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 365

1200. So like when you look at me, TReb is like maybe a future version of myself.
→ {"text": "所以當你看著我時，崔博就像是我未來的版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1201. And it could be looked at in a lot of different ways.
→ {"text": "這可以從很多不同角度來看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1202. But he's like a guide to me.
→ {"text": "但他對我來說像是一個嚮導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1203. He's a higher density, higher knowledge being that I pull from.
→ {"text": "他是一個更高密度、更高知識的存有，我從他那裡汲取。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 366

1204. TReb is to you.
→ {"text": "崔博對你來說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 367

1205. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1206. TReb, for my information and energy.
→ {"text": "崔博，為了我的資訊和能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1207. And TReb does that with Aridif.
→ {"text": "而崔博也對阿里迪夫做同樣的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1208. TReb's a fifth density being.
→ {"text": "崔博是第五密度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1209. And Aridif's a sixth density being.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫是第六密度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1210. So energetically, it's a higher energy.
→ {"text": "所以從能量上來說，這是更高的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 368

1211. And do TReb and Aridif-- I assume, they do communicate?
→ {"text": "那崔博和阿里迪夫——我想，他們有溝通吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1212. They know each other?
→ {"text": "他們認識彼此？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 369

1213. They know each other well.
→ {"text": "他們彼此很熟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1214. I had heard stories about Aridif before I ever connected with him.
→ {"text": "在我真正與他連結之前，我就聽過關於阿里迪夫的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1215. Back when I heard it-- because most of these entities don't have names of their own, they just have energy.
→ {"text": "早在我聽說的時候——因為大多數這些實體本身沒有名字，他們只有能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 370

1216. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 371

1217. And they give us names, because we're humans, and we need names to identify.
→ {"text": "所以他們給我們名字，因為我們是人類，我們需要名字來識別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1218. So TReb would talk about a being called Deneb Cygnus.
→ {"text": "所以崔博會談到一個叫做天鵝座天津四(Deneb Cygnus)的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1219. And that's the Deneb, like the star Deneb, and Cygnus, the constellation of the Swan.
→ {"text": "那就是天津四，就像天津四這顆星，以及天鵝座，也就是天鵝星座。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1220. And he said, this entity named Deneb Cygnus, and then he would tell a story about him, or tell a story about information that Deneb Cygnus had shared with him.
→ {"text": "他會說，這個名叫天鵝座天津四的實體，然後會講述關於他的故事，或講述天鵝座天津四與他分享的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1221. Well, eventually, I found out through the book that I did about TReb and his people, that that was Aridif.
→ {"text": "嗯，最終，我透過我寫的關於崔博和他族群的書發現，那就是阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1222. And Aridif gives us that name.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫給了我們那個名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1223. Aridif used that name with humans a long time ago.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫很久以前就對人類使用那個名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1224. Let me-- yeah, and I'm jumping ahead of myself.
→ {"text": "讓我——對，我有點跳太快了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1225. So let me give a little introduction to Aridif.
→ {"text": "所以讓我簡單介紹一下阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1226. Aridif is an Ancient Pleiadian entity, but he lives in the star called Deneb.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫是一個古昴宿星人實體，但他居住在一顆叫做天津四的星球上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1227. His race moved out of the Pleiades star system, which tens of thousands of races live there.
→ {"text": "他的種族搬出了昴宿星系，那裡有數萬個種族居住。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1228. They pulled their race out, because energetically, they needed a different-- he explained it as, we needed room to grow.
→ {"text": "他們把種族帶出來，因為從能量上來說，他們需要不同的——他解釋說，我們需要成長的空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1229. But what I think is the collective consciousness of a race is very similar to a star.
→ {"text": "但我認為一個種族的集體意識與一顆恆星非常相似。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1230. And in fact, that's why they incorporate so much energy.
→ {"text": "事實上，這就是為什麼他們能融合這麼多能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1231. If it's a smaller collective, it only needs a little space to grow.
→ {"text": "如果是較小的集體，它只需要一點點成長空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1232. But when you have these huge consciousnesses and you have a lot of them, they need energetic space.
→ {"text": "但當你有這些巨大的意識，而且數量很多時，他們需要能量空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1233. And that is shown by the star that they travel around.
→ {"text": "而這體現在他們圍繞的恆星上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1234. And Deneb is this gigantic, huge, supermassive, like 150 times the size of our sun.
→ {"text": "而天津四是這顆巨大的、超級巨大的恆星，大約是我們太陽的 150 倍大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1235. And that's where his race needed to go, because they grew into that.
→ {"text": "那就是他的種族需要去的地方，因為他們成長到了那個程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1236. They sprung into a huge-- and when you listen to Aridif, you can tell more than just his sentient energy, more than his wisdom, he's just huge expanded.
→ {"text": "他們躍升到巨大的——當你聆聽阿里迪夫時，你能感受到的不只是他的知覺能量，不只是他的智慧，他就是巨大擴展的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1237. They're at the level right before you leave physical reality altogether and join the oversoul energy back in the planetary collective.
→ {"text": "他們處於你完全離開物質實相，回到行星集體中加入超靈能量之前的那個層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1238. So I mean he's this huge being.
→ {"text": "所以我的意思是，他是這個巨大的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1239. And now they inhabit this star.
→ {"text": "現在他們居住在這顆恆星上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1240. And a lot of people ask about-- they don't know what he looks like.
→ {"text": "很多人問——他們不知道他長什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1241. And there's some art out there of him, and it's beautiful.
→ {"text": "外面有一些關於他的藝術作品，非常美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1242. Kalina did art too.
→ {"text": "卡莉娜(Kalina)也畫了藝術作品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1243. She's been able to see him too in her mind's eye.
→ {"text": "她也能夠在心眼中看到他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1244. Never TReb, but Aridif.
→ {"text": "從未看過崔博，但看過阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1245. They had a past life where she had met Aridif when he physically came to Earth.
→ {"text": "他們有過前世，她在阿里迪夫實際來到地球時遇見過他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 372

1246. When he was Deneb.
→ {"text": "當他是天津四的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 373

1247. Back in ancient Egypt.
→ {"text": "在古埃及時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 374

1248. When he was known as Deneb?
→ {"text": "當他被稱為天津四的時候？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 375

1249. Well, no.
→ {"text": "嗯，不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1250. The Aridif name was one that was known to Earth, but TReb never gave me that identity until later.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫這個名字是地球所知道的，但崔博直到後來才告訴我那個身分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1251. So he was still known as Aridif when I first heard of him, but TReb, for whatever reason, gave me the Deneb Cygnus name.
→ {"text": "所以當我第一次聽說他時，他仍然被稱為阿里迪夫，但崔博，不知為何，給了我天鵝座天津四這個名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 376

1252. So back in the Egyptian days, he was known as Aridif as well?
→ {"text": "所以在埃及時代，他也被稱為阿里迪夫？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 377

1253. Well, he said the name came from the era and how they knew him.
→ {"text": "嗯，他說這個名字來自那個時代以及他們如何認識他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1254. So maybe they knew what star he came from, and back then they might have called it Aridif.
→ {"text": "所以也許他們知道他來自哪顆星，而當時他們可能稱它為阿里迪夫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 378

1255. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 379

1256. I still don't know the specifics, but I think that's what it is.
→ {"text": "我還是不知道具體細節，但我想就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 380

1257. So maybe in Egyptian times, that's what they called them.
→ {"text": "所以也許在埃及時代，他們就是這樣稱呼他們的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 381

1258. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 382

1259. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 383

1260. And he hung out with Egyptians.
→ {"text": "他與埃及人相處過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1261. He just recently alluded to the fact that he had hung out with South African tribes, that he hung out with Egyptians, that he hung out with Indians, and some Southern American tribes.
→ {"text": "他最近暗示過，他曾與南非部落相處，與埃及人相處，與印度人相處，以及一些南美部落相處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1262. So he has been on the Earth manifested as a physical being in order to co-create with Earth before, kind of like an energetic quarantine, where it was kind of interference.
→ {"text": "所以他曾經以物質存有的形式顯化在地球上，以便與地球共同創造，有點像是能量隔離，在那裡有某種干涉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1263. And that's a difficult, long subject to get into.
→ {"text": "那是一個很難深入探討的漫長主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1264. But he has co-created with humans.
→ {"text": "但他確實與人類共同創造過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1265. And I think that him understanding humanity before he came here, even though it was a much older version, gave him a great opportunity when he teaches to have it really resonate with people.
→ {"text": "我認為，他在來這裡之前對人類的理解，儘管那是一個古老得多的版本，但這給了他一個很好的機會，當他教導時能真正與人們產生共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1266. Plus the amount of wisdom that comes out of him is ungodly.
→ {"text": "而且從他身上流出的智慧量是令人難以置信的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1267. It's just beautiful.
→ {"text": "真的很美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 384

1268. So Aridif used to interact with the human race back in the day; South Africans, Egyptians, probably more.
→ {"text": "所以阿里迪夫以前曾與人類互動過;南非人、埃及人，可能還有更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1269. But has it been a while then?
→ {"text": "但那已經過了一段時間了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1270. Is this like his-- he took a break, and now he's back.
→ {"text": "這是不是像他——他休息了一下，現在又回來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1271. And humanity is like, oh, wow, look at humanity.
→ {"text": "然後人類就像，哦，哇，看看人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1272. Or has he been constantly monitoring?
→ {"text": "還是他一直在監測？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1273. And do other people channel Aridif?
→ {"text": "還有其他人通靈阿里迪夫嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 385

1274. From what I know, no one else has.
→ {"text": "就我所知，沒有其他人通靈過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1275. Some people said that his energy is familiar.
→ {"text": "有些人說他的能量很熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1276. So I don't know.
→ {"text": "所以我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1277. But I do know that he's been interacting with humans for a long time.
→ {"text": "但我確實知道他與人類互動已經很長時間了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1278. It's been thousands of years, he said, before he's reconnected.
→ {"text": "他說，在他重新連結之前，已經過了數千年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1279. And even now he's not physically connecting.
→ {"text": "即使現在，他也不是以物質形式連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 386

1280. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 387

1281. Right now, it's an important growth time for humans.
→ {"text": "現在，這是人類重要的成長時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1282. And a lot of the hands-on interactions are not appreciated by some of the ETs.
→ {"text": "而許多直接的互動並不被某些外星人所認同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1283. For instance, type 1 and type 2, this is the definition Aridif and TReb have given.
→ {"text": "例如，第一類型和第二類型，這是阿里迪夫和崔博給出的定義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1284. Type 1, they'll do it in the way that TReb and Aridif are.
→ {"text": "第一類型，他們會以崔博和阿里迪夫的方式行事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 388

1285. Type 1 civilization or type 1 ET?
→ {"text": "第一類型文明還是第一類型外星人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 389

1286. Type 1 extraterrestrial kind, energetic kind.
→ {"text": "第一類型外星種類，能量種類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 390

1287. And what is--
→ {"text": "那什麼是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 391

1288. A type 1 defined is an entity who respects the free will of all things, will not interfere.
→ {"text": "第一類型的定義是尊重萬物自由意志的實體，不會干涉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 392

1289. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 393

1290. And looks above and below them, energetically speaking.
→ {"text": "從能量上來說，他們既向上看也向下看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1291. They look above them for inspiration, wisdom, to incorporate.
→ {"text": "他們向上尋求靈感、智慧，並加以融入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1292. And then below them to redistribute that information.
→ {"text": "然後向下重新分配那些資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1293. They see themselves as a part of one.
→ {"text": "他們視自己為一體的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 394

1294. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 395

1295. A type 2 sees division.
→ {"text": "第二類型看見分裂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1296. A type 2 being only looks below them for what they can overpower or oversee.
→ {"text": "第二類型存有只向下看他們能夠壓制或監督的對象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1297. They never look above them.
→ {"text": "他們從不向上看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1298. They look equal or below to them, energetically speaking.
→ {"text": "從能量上來說，他們只看與他們平等或在他們之下的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1299. They also are not afraid to interject themselves on the behalf of themselves or others.
→ {"text": "他們也不怕代表自己或他人而介入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1300. For instance, a lot of these channeled entities that have come out are talking about, we are going to help you.
→ {"text": "例如，很多這些出現的通靈實體都在說，我們要幫助你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1301. We're going to do this for you.
→ {"text": "我們要為你們做這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1302. We're going to do that for you.
→ {"text": "我們要為你們做那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1303. They're doing that, because-- some of them with great intent.
→ {"text": "他們這樣做，是因為——有些是出於善意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1304. They are like, we love you.
→ {"text": "他們說，我們愛你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1305. You're messing up.
→ {"text": "你們搞砸了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1306. We want to help you.
→ {"text": "我們想幫助你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1307. But in their mind, they know better than we do.
→ {"text": "但在他們心智中，他們認為自己比我們更了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1308. And Aridif and TReb come from a place that you guys manifest what you want as a collective, because that is what you want.
→ {"text": "而阿里迪夫和崔博來自一個立場，那就是你們作為一個集體顯化你們想要的，因為那就是你們想要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1309. And we will respect your journey.
→ {"text": "我們會尊重你們的旅程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1310. Even if you nuke yourself to oblivion, we will respect it.
→ {"text": "即使你們把自己核彈炸到毀滅，我們也會尊重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1311. And we will never step in the way.
→ {"text": "我們永遠不會阻擋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1312. Because they know it's a soul's journey.
→ {"text": "因為他們知道這是靈魂的旅程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1313. The other entities look at it as a physical thing, or even a soul level, just at a different interval.
→ {"text": "其他實體將其視為物質層面的事，或甚至是靈魂層面，只是在不同的時間間隔。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1314. So these are the fundamental differences.
→ {"text": "所以這些就是根本的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1315. And back when Aridif did interact with humans, he did it from his incarnation now, but he also has done it from previous incarnations of his Denebian race.
→ {"text": "而早期當阿里迪夫與人類互動時，他是從他現在的轉世這樣做的，但他也從他天津四星族的前世轉世中這樣做過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1316. So in that way--
→ {"text": "所以從那個角度來說——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 396

1317. Denebian race.
→ {"text": "天津四星族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 397

1318. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1319. And Ancient Pleiadians is what we call it, because that's how he introduced themselves.
→ {"text": "而我們稱之為古昴宿星人，因為他就是這樣介紹自己的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1320. But Denebian, that's another term for their race.
→ {"text": "但天津四星族，那是他們種族的另一個稱呼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1321. They're from the star Deneb.
→ {"text": "他們來自天津四星。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1322. So Denebians are another term for them.
→ {"text": "所以天津四星族是他們的另一個稱呼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1323. But they have interacted from previous incarnations.
→ {"text": "但他們從前世轉世就一直在互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1324. So he dealt with humans not just in this life, but his past lives too.
→ {"text": "所以他與人類打交道不只是在這一世，在他的前世也是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 398

1325. Interesting.
→ {"text": "很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1326. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1327. And the overall message-- so they're obviously type 1 ETs.
→ {"text": "那整體訊息是——所以他們顯然是第一類型外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1328. And their overall message, if you could sum it up
→ {"text": "如果你能總結他們的整體訊息", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 399

1329. If I could sum it up in one sentence, it's you create everything.
→ {"text": "如果我能用一句話總結，那就是，你創造一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1330. And If I could sum it up in a small paragraph, we create that physical reality around us, and every aspect of it.
→ {"text": "如果我用一個小段落總結，我們創造我們周圍的物質實相，以及它的每個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1331. And when we do, we bring the reflections of what's inside of ourselves to be outside of ourselves and to co-create.
→ {"text": "當我們這樣做時，我們將內在的反映帶到我們外在，並共同創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1332. So a lot of people look at it.
→ {"text": "所以很多人看它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1333. Well, how is Reuben a projection of Rob?
→ {"text": "嗯，魯本(Reuben)怎麼會是 Rob 的投射？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1334. Well, it has to be.
→ {"text": "嗯，必然如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1335. There's you there, and there's me there.
→ {"text": "那裡有你，那裡有我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1336. But I'm bringing you into my reality for a reason, as you are me.
→ {"text": "但我把你帶入我的實相是有原因的，因為你就是我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1337. We're co-creating a reflection.
→ {"text": "我們正在共同創造一個反映。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1338. And literally, you're a version that I projected into my universe.
→ {"text": "從字面上來說，你是我投射到我宇宙中的一個版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1339. But it's very literal in those terms.
→ {"text": "但就那些術語而言，這是非常字面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1340. And people don't look at it in that way.
→ {"text": "而人們不會以那種方式看待它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1341. They're like, figuratively, you create.
→ {"text": "他們會說，比喻上，你在創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1342. No, literally.
→ {"text": "不，是字面上的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1343. And figuratively.
→ {"text": "也是比喻上的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 400

1344. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 401

1345. That's the message.
→ {"text": "這就是訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1346. And they explore all parts of it.
→ {"text": "他們探索它的所有部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1347. They give answers for extraterrestrial things.
→ {"text": "他們提供關於外星事物的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1348. What's going on in our galaxy?
→ {"text": "我們銀河系中正在發生什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1349. I've always termed it universal, or galactic knowledge, universal knowledge, what's going on out there.
→ {"text": "我一直稱之為宇宙知識，或銀河知識，宇宙知識，那裡正在發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1350. And that's an important part.
→ {"text": "這是很重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1351. The other entities, too, that I've channeled, Nihal, Metatron.
→ {"text": "我通靈的其他實體也是，尼哈爾(Nihal)、梅塔特隆(Metatron)。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1352. Metatron would say that the universal and galactic knowledge is not so important.
→ {"text": "梅塔特隆會說，宇宙和銀河知識並不那麼重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1353. What's important is you growing into who you are.
→ {"text": "重要的是你成長為你自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1354. So sometimes he talks about humans distract themselves with what's going on out there when they can't figure out what's going on down here.
→ {"text": "所以有時他談到，人類在無法弄清楚這裡發生什麼時，就用外面發生的事來分散自己的注意力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 402

1355. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 403

1356. A different point of view, and I respect that.
→ {"text": "不同的觀點，我尊重那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1357. And I understand.
→ {"text": "我理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1358. But TReb and Aridif bring us a perspective that's universal.
→ {"text": "但崔博和阿里迪夫帶給我們的是一個宇宙性的視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1359. And it gives us our opportunity to say how humans fit in this universal complex, which is something that a lot of people have strived to know their whole lives.
→ {"text": "這給了我們機會去說明人類如何融入這個宇宙複合體，這是很多人一生都在努力想知道的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1360. And it's very easy to see the human race as a part of it, but not how each individual is a part of first the Earth collective, then the universalness.
→ {"text": "很容易看到人類種族是其中的一部分，但不容易看到每個個體如何首先是地球集體的一部分，然後才是宇宙性的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1361. It's amazing.
→ {"text": "這很驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1362. It's something that Aridif sums up very well.
→ {"text": "這是阿里迪夫總結得非常好的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 404

1363. And just you mentioned the Nihal.
→ {"text": "你剛才提到尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 405

1364. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 406

1365. Is that a collective consciousness?
→ {"text": "那是一個集體意識嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 407

1366. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1367. That is a collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "那是一個集體意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1368. Now, the Nihal, a very interesting story.
→ {"text": "現在，尼哈爾，一個非常有趣的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1369. I'll give you a bit about them.
→ {"text": "我會告訴你一些關於他們的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1370. The Nihal are future humans.
→ {"text": "尼哈爾是未來的人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1371. They exist as one of our timelines in the future.
→ {"text": "他們作為我們未來的時間線之一而存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1372. So it's a probable reality where we leave Earth.
→ {"text": "所以這是一個我們離開地球的可能實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1373. Well, not all of us, but a chunk of us leave Earth and become the Nihal.
→ {"text": "嗯，不是所有人，但我們中的一大部分離開地球並成為尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1374. And we evolve into very short beings, about-- I can't remember-- three to four foot, somewhere in there.
→ {"text": "我們進化成非常矮小的存有，大約——我記不清了——三到四英呎，差不多那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1375. Orange-ish skin, highly psychic.
→ {"text": "橙色的皮膚，高度通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1376. And we evolve into that.
→ {"text": "我們就進化成那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1377. Now, the fun part, the part where it ties back in, the Nihal are the race who seeded TReb's race.
→ {"text": "現在，有趣的部分，它連結回來的部分，尼哈爾就是播種崔博種族的種族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1378. So TReb's race was a byproduct, or a direct product, of engineering DNA from a human being DNA and from a second density lizard being who lived in, I believe, the Capellan region, which is where TReb comes from.
→ {"text": "所以崔博的種族是人類DNA與一個第二密度蜥蜴存有的DNA工程的副產品，或直接產品，我相信那個蜥蜴存有生活在五車二星域，那就是崔博的來源地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 408

1379. Human or Nihal DNA, but Nihal being human.
→ {"text": "人類DNA還是尼哈爾DNA，但尼哈爾是人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 409

1380. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1381. Nihal.
→ {"text": "尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1382. But it is different than human DNA.
→ {"text": "但它與人類DNA不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1383. And that's a good point you bring up. also occurs when one race leaves their home planet and goes to another.
→ {"text": "你提出了一個好觀點。當一個種族離開他們的母星去另一個星球時也會發生這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1384. The planet itself is a being.
→ {"text": "星球本身就是一個存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1385. It's a seventh density collective being.
→ {"text": "它是一個第七密度集體存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 410

1386. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 411

1387. And then this race that comes is also a collective of the seventh density with all the oversouls at the lower seventh density.
→ {"text": "然後這個來到的種族也是第七密度的集體，所有超靈都在較低的第七密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1388. And then they meet.
→ {"text": "然後他們相遇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1389. They co-create a brand new energy.
→ {"text": "他們共同創造一個全新的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1390. So both collectives merge into one, and the DNA changes.
→ {"text": "所以兩個集體融合為一，DNA就改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1391. And that's why when the human race leaves the other planets, they change their physical appearance, because their DNA changes.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼當人類種族離開到其他星球時，他們會改變物質外觀，因為他們的DNA改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1392. Their physical body adapts to the new merging of the collective planet consciousness and their race's consciousness.
→ {"text": "他們的物質身體適應集體行星意識與他們種族意識的新融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1393. So that's a part of it too.
→ {"text": "所以這也是其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1394. Now, when we're getting into the Nihal, the reason for doing TReb's race, a lot of people are like, well, if we're evolved, why would we be messing with DNA?
→ {"text": "現在，當我們談到尼哈爾，創造崔博種族的原因，很多人會說，嗯，如果我們已經進化了，為什麼還要亂搞DNA？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1395. We've had that done to us.
→ {"text": "我們也被這樣對待過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1396. It's not very nice.
→ {"text": "這不太好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1397. There's such a stigma around negative reptilian energy.
→ {"text": "圍繞著負面爬蟲人能量有如此強烈的污名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1398. And it was hinted, not ever directly said, yes, this is the 100% reason.
→ {"text": "這被暗示過，但從未直接說，是的，這就是 100% 的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1399. But TReb, Aridif, but more so than that, another entity who I channeled in the book about TReb's race, one of their-- I think it was the military, ex-military.
→ {"text": "但崔博、阿里迪夫，更進一步的是，我在關於崔博種族的書中通靈的另一個實體，他們其中一個——我想是軍方，前軍方的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 412

1400. The woman?
→ {"text": "那個女性？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 413

1401. Yes, the woman.
→ {"text": "對，那個女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1402. She said that the reason that they did that was so that they could show the entire galaxy that not all reptilians are bad.
→ {"text": "她說他們這樣做的原因是為了向整個銀河系展示，並非所有爬蟲人都是壞的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1403. The stigma of Earth, especially Earth, was that reptilians are negative.
→ {"text": "地球的污名，尤其是地球，就是爬蟲人是負面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1404. They will eat your children.
→ {"text": "他們會吃掉你的孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1405. They'll drug you.
→ {"text": "他們會給你下藥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1406. They'll throw you in a cave, and put you in their pie.
→ {"text": "他們會把你扔進洞穴，然後把你放進他們的派裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 414

1407. What is it the-- David Icke, the queen, and all of our government officials evolved.
→ {"text": "那是什麼——大衛·艾克(David Icke)，女王，以及我們所有政府官員的進化。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語意略模糊"}

1408. Evil reptilians taking over the planet.
→ {"text": "邪惡爬蟲人接管地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 415

1409. And I get it.
→ {"text": "我理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 416

1410. That could-- that's probably true.
→ {"text": "那可能——那可能是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 417

1411. But not every reptilian has that.
→ {"text": "但不是每個爬蟲人都那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 418

1412. Yeah, exactly.
→ {"text": "對，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 419

1413. And TReb-- this is something I commend TReb for.
→ {"text": "而崔博——這是我讚賞崔博的一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1414. He is one of the very few channels who have come out and said, listen, the evil reptilians are there.
→ {"text": "他是極少數站出來說的通靈管道之一，聽著，邪惡的爬蟲人確實存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1415. This is what they've done to you.
→ {"text": "這就是他們對你們做過的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1416. This is how they're still doing things to you.
→ {"text": "這就是他們仍然在對你們做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1417. But you're focusing on it, and it's going to keep going on.
→ {"text": "但你們專注於此，它就會持續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1418. When you pull your focus from it and start focusing on the power you have, then it doesn't-- then even if they're standing next to you slapping people with whips, they can't touch you.
→ {"text": "當你將焦點從它那裡移開，開始專注於你擁有的力量時，那麼它就不會——那麼即使他們站在你旁邊用鞭子抽打人們，他們也無法觸及你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 420

1419. Just like Jesus and the cross.
→ {"text": "就像耶穌和十字架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1420. It was much-- the story's go as much they were whipping him and torturing him, he didn't feel a thing.
→ {"text": "故事說，當他們鞭打他、折磨他時，他什麼都沒感覺到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 421

1421. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1422. And that's the beauty part of it.
→ {"text": "這就是美好的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1423. That's something that TReb brings to us.
→ {"text": "這就是崔博帶給我們的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1424. And the Nihal wanted to show us that.
→ {"text": "而尼哈爾想向我們展示這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1425. They wanted to show us-- I think it was targeted for humans, but around the galaxy, there's still a stigma that most reptilians are neg-- even if they've interacted with a good reptilian.
→ {"text": "他們想向我們展示——我認為這是針對人類的，但在銀河系各地，仍然存在大多數爬蟲人是負面的污名——即使他們與善良的爬蟲人互動過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1426. Humanoids, I think, because of the damage they've had through slavery, the Anunnaki was half-reptilian, the ancient reptilians, the Earth reptilians.
→ {"text": "類人生物，我認為，因為他們經歷過奴役造成的傷害，阿努納奇(Anunnaki)是半爬蟲人，古代爬蟲人，地球爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1427. Those are all bad stories for humans.
→ {"text": "這些對人類來說都是糟糕的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1428. And that's kind of built in our DNA to fear them.
→ {"text": "這在某種程度上已經內建在我們的DNA中，讓我們恐懼他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1429. And people, like David Icke, who've research just that part of it and shared it, it scares the crap out of people.
→ {"text": "而像大衛·艾克(David Icke)這樣的人，他們只研究了那部分並分享出來，這把人們嚇得屁滾尿流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 422

1430. It continues to feed into that.
→ {"text": "這繼續滋養那種恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1431. Well, over the next couple of days, let's get into some channeling.
→ {"text": "嗯，在接下來的幾天裡，讓我們進行一些通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1432. And I'd love to talk to TReb and Aridif and explore their world some more.
→ {"text": "我很想跟崔博和阿里迪夫談談，並更深入探索他們的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1433. Thanks for sharing your adventures.
→ {"text": "謝謝你分享你的冒險經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 423

1434. You're absolutely welcome.
→ {"text": "非常歡迎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 424

1435. And we'll see some more of you.
→ {"text": "我們會再見到你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 425

1436. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 426

1437. Thanks, Rob.
→ {"text": "謝謝你，Rob。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
