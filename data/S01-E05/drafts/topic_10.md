## Speaker Group 312

1003. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1004. And that was another thing.
→ {"text": "而且那是另一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1005. My English skills have zero.
→ {"text": "我的英語能力是零。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1006. When I went through school, I sucked at it.
→ {"text": "當我上學時，我很爛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1007. I could speak English.
→ {"text": "我會說英語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

1008. Just like me.
→ {"text": "就像我一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

1009. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1010. And it's not something that I was great at.
→ {"text": "這不是我擅長的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 315

1011. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

1012. But the more I cared about how I talked, because I realized-- and Kalina has been my number one helper in that.
→ {"text": "但我越關心我怎麼說話，因為我意識到——卡莉娜在這方面是我的頭號幫手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1013. Every time I throw a word that doesn't exist or one that's mispronounced, she helps me with that, because she knows, they need that too to reflect back on.
→ {"text": "每次我說一個不存在的詞或發音錯誤的詞，她都會幫我，因為她知道，他們也需要那個來反映。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

1014. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 318

1015. But the more energy I opened up, the more clarity came with it, the easier it was for them to find the translation, not only of energy, but words.
→ {"text": "但我打開的能量越多，隨之而來的清晰度越多，他們越容易找到翻譯，不僅是能量，還有詞彙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 319

1016. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1017. So TReb started coming in, and you're checking in.
→ {"text": "所以崔博開始進來，而你在確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1018. Are you still going and doing your meditations with him at the same time during this process?
→ {"text": "在這個過程中，你還在同時與他一起冥想嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1019. Or is the process of channeling, is it the same as going into the meditations?
→ {"text": "還是通靈的過程，和進入冥想是一樣的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1020. Are you trance channeling, I guess, in a sense where -- are you conscious of what's happening during the channel?
→ {"text": "你是在出神通靈嗎，我猜，在某種意義上——你在通靈期間意識到正在發生什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 320

1021. Now, it depends.
→ {"text": "現在，這要看情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1022. There are three types of channel states that I do.
→ {"text": "我有三種通靈狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1023. All of them are trance channeling.
→ {"text": "所有這些都是出神通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1024. The first and most common occurrence is just like when I visited TReb.
→ {"text": "第一種也是最常見的情況，就像我拜訪崔博時一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1025. I'm going to visit him.
→ {"text": "我要去拜訪他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1026. I'm there with him astrally.
→ {"text": "我在星光層與他在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1027. I perceive him in real-time, just as real as we are.
→ {"text": "我即時感知到他，就像我們一樣真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1028. And that happens the most.
→ {"text": "這種情況最常發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1029. And while I'm channeling down here, not conscious of anything that's being said, I'm hanging out with him.
→ {"text": "而當我在這裡通靈時，不意識到任何正在說的事情，我和他一起玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1030. Going fishing with TReb.
→ {"text": "和崔博去釣魚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 321

1031. Right. Right.
→ {"text": "對。對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 322

1032. And the second level is the same thing.
→ {"text": "第二個層次是同樣的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1033. I'm out of my body.
→ {"text": "我離開我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1034. I'm experiencing something.
→ {"text": "我正在經歷某事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1035. But usually, it's something that needs to be seen by me.
→ {"text": "但通常，這是需要我看到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1036. And this can be a lot of different things.
→ {"text": "這可以是很多不同的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1037. TReb showed me time periods.
→ {"text": "崔博向我展示時間段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1038. He showed me different planets, different animals, different vegetation, just all sorts of stuff that at a later time comes in for referencing that I need.
→ {"text": "他向我展示不同的星球、不同的動物、不同的植被，各種各樣的東西，在稍後時間作為我需要的參考。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1039. So that happens very seldomly.
→ {"text": "所以這種情況很少發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 323

1040. When you say, come in for reference, in what sense?
→ {"text": "當你說，作為參考，是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1041. Like the conversation we're having here, and you can reference that stuff?
→ {"text": "像我們在這裡的對話，你可以參考那些東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

1042. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1043. Like sometimes, people are like, yeah, I met this reptilian being that was so and so.
→ {"text": "像有時候，人們會說，對，我遇到這個爬蟲存有，是這樣那樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1044. And so I was like, oh, that's the same one that TReb showed me.
→ {"text": "所以我會想，哦，那就是崔博展示給我的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1045. Or I wonder what happened in this timeline.
→ {"text": "或者我想知道這個時間線發生了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1046. It gives me a better understanding.
→ {"text": "這給了我更好的理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1047. And I don't understand what it is in the moment, but in reflecting later, I always get what's going on.
→ {"text": "我當下不明白那是什麼，但後來反思時，我總是明白發生了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

1048. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

1049. So that's the second most common occurrence.
→ {"text": "所以這是第二常見的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1050. And then the last one is where I'm like in a deep meditative state, where everything's just kind of blacked out, sometimes colors, sometimes things like that.
→ {"text": "然後最後一種是我處於深度冥想狀態，一切都是黑的，有時有顏色，有時有那樣的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1051. And I'm able to hear what's going on in the session.
→ {"text": "而我能夠聽到節目中正在發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1052. Now, if I channel 100 times, probably 85 to 90 of them are me and TReb hanging out.
→ {"text": "現在，如果我通靈 100 次，大概 85 到 90 次是我和崔博一起玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1053. All of them, but one of them would be the deep meditation where I'm hearing the session.
→ {"text": "所有這些中，但其中一次會是深度冥想，我在聽節目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1054. And this only occurs when there is something I really need to hear in that moment in the session.
→ {"text": "這只有在節目中的那個時刻有我真正需要聽到的東西時才會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1055. So it very rarely occurs.
→ {"text": "所以這種情況很少發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

1056. Do you ever go in and out, like you're hanging out with him, and all of a sudden you get sucked back into the room?
→ {"text": "你會進進出出嗎，像是你和他一起玩，然後突然被吸回房間？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

1057. No, never.
→ {"text": "不，從來沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1058. It's always with TReb all the time, or he's showing me something, or then.
→ {"text": "總是一直和崔博在一起，或者他在向我展示某些東西，或者然後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1059. And the second most common one where he's showing me something, it's not with him.
→ {"text": "而第二常見的那種他向我展示某些東西的，不是和他在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1060. It's me separately by myself seeing these things.
→ {"text": "是我自己單獨看到這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1061. So that rarely ever occurs.
→ {"text": "所以這種情況很少發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1062. Out of 100 times, maybe 14 times I'll be doing that.
→ {"text": "100 次中，也許 14 次我會這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1063. So it's not very-- and it's probably less than that, but I'm trying to give a scale for people to understand that.
→ {"text": "所以不是很——而且可能比那個少，但我試圖給人們一個理解的尺度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

1064. Now, do you-- since starting the channeling, since having these conversations with TReb, the meditations, have you become more-- instead of just applying these things to your life, have you noticed your own intuitiveness or psychic abilities, or anything else happening in these past few years?
→ {"text": "現在，你——自從開始通靈，自從與崔博進行這些對話、冥想，你變得更——而不僅僅是將這些事情應用到你的生活中，你有注意到你自己的直覺或通靈能力，或者在過去幾年中發生的任何其他事情嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

1065. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "絕對有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1066. The integration process.
→ {"text": "整合過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1067. And this is something that's fairly new to me.
→ {"text": "這對我來說是相當新的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1068. I've been doing channeling in the sense of public channeling since about 2010, late 2010.
→ {"text": "我從 2010 年左右開始做公開通靈，2010 年底。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1069. And in that time, I was always aware that TReb's energy was around me, but it never went past that.
→ {"text": "在那段時間，我一直意識到崔博的能量在我周圍，但從未超過那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1070. My life, my intuition was good, but it was no better than where I was when I first started meditating and learning to receive.
→ {"text": "我的生活，我的直覺很好，但並不比我第一次開始冥想和學習接收時更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1071. In the last year, year and a half-- well, it's probably closer to two years now-- I've actually been more conscious of TReb and Aridif as they come through.
→ {"text": "在過去一年、一年半——嗯，現在可能更接近兩年了——我實際上更意識到崔博和阿里迪夫的到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1072. I can hear TReb give me messages while I'm in the wakened state.
→ {"text": "我可以在清醒狀態下聽到崔博給我訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1073. I feel more of his consciousness.
→ {"text": "我更感受到他的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1074. My personality even is more the style of TReb, where-- like TReb, he loves everything.
→ {"text": "我的個性甚至更像崔博的風格，就像——崔博，他愛一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1075. He wants to experience everything.
→ {"text": "他想體驗一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1076. And I find more of that energy in me.
→ {"text": "而我在自己身上發現更多那種能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1077. And there's always been a part of that for me.
→ {"text": "而我一直有那部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1078. I've always enjoyed enjoying things, but to a different extent.
→ {"text": "我一直喜歡享受事物，但程度不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1079. I could feel that combining with TReb's energy.
→ {"text": "我可以感覺到這與崔博的能量結合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1080. So it's like an amalgamation.
→ {"text": "所以這就像融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1081. And this goes with psychic ability.
→ {"text": "這與通靈能力有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1082. It goes with everything.
→ {"text": "與一切有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1083. There's times where I grab something and walk it over to Kalina.
→ {"text": "有時候我拿起某樣東西並走到卡莉娜那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1084. And she's like, I was just going to ask you for that.
→ {"text": "她會說，我正要向你要那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1085. Or things simple like that, like picking a movie that she had wanted to watch, or a song that she was dying to hear.
→ {"text": "或者像那樣簡單的事情，像是選一部她想看的電影，或一首她很想聽的歌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1086. So those things.
→ {"text": "所以那些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1087. And that shows a great deal about both of our connection too as well.
→ {"text": "這也顯示了我們兩個連結的很大一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1088. But meeting Kalina was probably one of the energetic shifting points on a lot of things.
→ {"text": "但遇見卡莉娜可能是很多事情的能量轉變點之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1089. When I met Kalina, it's just the energy shifted so much.
→ {"text": "當我遇見卡莉娜時，能量轉變了很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1090. I finally found a partner who was on the same journey that I was.
→ {"text": "我終於找到了一個和我在同一旅程上的伴侶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1091. The same excitements.
→ {"text": "同樣的興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1092. She met me through the work I was doing.
→ {"text": "她通過我正在做的工作認識我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1093. She was helping me edit videos and stuff as we developed a friendship for a couple of years.
→ {"text": "她幫我編輯影片和東西，我們發展了幾年的友誼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1094. And then as my divorce happened with my ex-wife, then me and her got together.
→ {"text": "然後當我與前妻離婚時，我和她在一起了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1095. And we started a relationship.
→ {"text": "我們開始了一段關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1096. And her excitements and my excitements, because they're on the same level, we reflect that.
→ {"text": "她的興奮和我的興奮，因為它們在同一層次，我們反映那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1097. So our psychic ability helps.
→ {"text": "所以我們的通靈能力有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1098. The efforts of the work has helped.
→ {"text": "工作的努力有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1099. I was just-- when I first started channeling, I was doing it for fun.
→ {"text": "我只是——當我第一次開始通靈時，我是為了樂趣而做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1100. I was doing it for the benefit of other people, which I still am.
→ {"text": "我是為了其他人的利益而做，我仍然是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1101. But I had a daytime job.
→ {"text": "但我有一份日間工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1102. I worked that job 10 hours a day.
→ {"text": "我每天工作 10 小時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

1103. I was going to say, how in the world could you meditate for as long as you did for the first two years, and still maintain a job, and have a son?
→ {"text": "我正要說，你到底怎麼能在前兩年冥想那麼長時間，還能保持工作，還有一個兒子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1104. And that's crazy.
→ {"text": "那太瘋狂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1105. Did you sleep?
→ {"text": "你睡覺了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

1106. Well, the first hour and 25 minutes, that was pretty easy.
→ {"text": "嗯，第一個小時 25 分鐘，那很容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1107. The first one in the morning before all the kids.
→ {"text": "早上第一次在所有孩子之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1108. Because I used to babysit, so I was at home.
→ {"text": "因為我以前當保姆，所以我在家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

1109. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 334

1110. I could work from home.
→ {"text": "我可以在家工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1111. And when these four to six kids would come over, I would be able to meditate before they got there, and then once at lunch time when I put them all for a nap, and once after Jeremy.
→ {"text": "當這四到六個孩子來時，我能夠在他們到達之前冥想，然後在午餐時間當我讓他們都午睡時再一次，還有在 Jeremy 之後再一次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1112. He would get home from school after the kids would leave.
→ {"text": "他會在孩子們離開後從學校回家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1113. And then I would be able to put him to bed, and then do it.
→ {"text": "然後我能夠讓他上床睡覺，然後做它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 335

1114. So you figured it out somehow.
→ {"text": "所以你以某種方式想出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 336

1115. I did.
→ {"text": "我想出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

1116. You managed to get those several-- two to four hours a day?
→ {"text": "你設法得到那幾個——每天兩到四個小時？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

1117. Well, three of the meditations were an hour to an hour and 25.
→ {"text": "嗯，三次冥想是一小時到一小時 25 分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1118. My closed-eye technique didn't require me to be anywhere.
→ {"text": "我的閉眼技法不需要我去任何地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1119. I could still be present with you.
→ {"text": "我仍然可以和你在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1120. Like right now, I'm closing my eyes.
→ {"text": "就像現在，我閉上眼睛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1121. I can hear you.
→ {"text": "我能聽到你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1122. I can hear Kalina, so I'm OK.
→ {"text": "我能聽到卡莉娜，所以我沒事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1123. And if I didn't need my eyes, I could literally up to six to eight hours a day do the closed-eye technique.
→ {"text": "如果我不需要我的眼睛，我可以每天字面上做六到八小時的閉眼技法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1124. Whenever I didn't need my eyes, they were shut all the time.
→ {"text": "每當我不需要我的眼睛，它們就一直閉著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1125. I was dedicated.
→ {"text": "我很專注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1126. I was like--
→ {"text": "我就像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

1127. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1128. That's awesome.
→ {"text": "那太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 340

1129. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1130. I was like--
→ {"text": "我就像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

1131. I'm taking notes.
→ {"text": "我在做筆記。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

1132. An addict for meditation.
→ {"text": "冥想成癮者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

1133. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 344

1134. It was.
→ {"text": "確實是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1135. I was addicted to it.
→ {"text": "我對它上癮了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 345

1136. Do you still meditate then?
→ {"text": "那你還在冥想嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 346

1137. The only meditation I need now is when I connect to TReb.
→ {"text": "我現在唯一需要的冥想是當我連結到崔博時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1138. I do it so frequently, that that is my meditation now.
→ {"text": "我做得如此頻繁，那現在就是我的冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 347

1139. I was going to say-- because it sounds like a meditation.
→ {"text": "我正要說——因為這聽起來像冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1140. You're going to this deep-- you're going to another planet.
→ {"text": "你進入這個深層——你去到另一個星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1141. Jeez.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1142. That's awesome.
→ {"text": "那太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 348

1143. Well, in all honesty, though, it's something that I found about people in their spiritual journey.
→ {"text": "嗯，說實話，這是我在人們的靈性旅程中發現的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1144. And something that just recently was brought up in a conversation.
→ {"text": "而且最近在一次對話中提到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1145. When you reach a certain point of integrating with these beings or integrating with your higher self, whatever it is, when you feel good about your life when you're living that vibration, there's not always as much need for meditation.
→ {"text": "當你達到與這些存有整合或與你的高我整合的某一點時，無論是什麼，當你對生活感覺良好時，當你活出那個頻率時，對冥想的需求就不總是那麼多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1146. So when I meditate and connect my TReb, I'm integrating.
→ {"text": "所以當我冥想並連結我的崔博時，我在整合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1147. But during the day now, I'm integrating, too, because I used that meditation to pull myself out of suffering and pain to start with.
→ {"text": "但現在白天，我也在整合，因為我一開始用那個冥想把自己從痛苦和疼痛中拉出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1148. And then I used it to hone my skills.
→ {"text": "然後我用它來磨練我的技能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1149. My skills are here.
→ {"text": "我的技能在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1150. They're strong.
→ {"text": "它們很強。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1151. I don't have very much suffering anymore.
→ {"text": "我不再有太多痛苦了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1152. I'm still human, so a little bit here and there.
→ {"text": "我仍然是人類，所以這裡那裡有一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1153. So now there's not as much a need.
→ {"text": "所以現在沒有那麼多需求。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1154. And the time I spend with TReb, I'm doing this now as a living.
→ {"text": "而我與崔博共度的時間，我現在以此為生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1155. So when I'm doing it once, twice, three times a day, that's my meditation.
→ {"text": "所以當我每天做一次、兩次、三次時，那就是我的冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1156. It works.
→ {"text": "它有用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
