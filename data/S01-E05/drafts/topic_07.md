472. And after that point, I was hesitant to go back.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我很猶豫要不要再回去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. And I questioned myself more than I did just about any time in my life.
→ {"text": "我質疑自己的程度，比我一生中任何時候都要嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. Even more than the--

## Speaker Group 120

475. Questioning your sanity.
→ {"text": "質疑你的神智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

477. I had talked to my ex-wife, she was my wife then, about it.

478. And she said, this meditation is doing something to you probably.

479. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
→ {"text": "我不會太擔心的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. You seem OK.

482. So finally I...
→ {"text": "所以最後我⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

483. And the rest of your life was getting better at this point, because of the meditations?
→ {"text": "那在這時候，你生活的其他方面因為冥想而變好了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

484. Oh, yes, yes.
→ {"text": "噢，是的，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. By this time, I had already spent several months with the church, several months after the church meditating.
→ {"text": "到那時候，我已經在教會待了幾個月，離開教會後又冥想了幾個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. So my life was really getting smooth again.
→ {"text": "所以我的生活真的又開始順遂起來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

487. And relationships, and your son, and your viewpoint, and all that was getting better?
→ {"text": "那人際關係、你兒子、你的觀點，這些都變好了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

488. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. It was getting a lot better at that point.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，一切都好轉很多了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

490. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. So you knew the meditations were working, not in a negative way, but in a positive way.
→ {"text": "所以你知道冥想是有效的，不是以負面的方式，而是正面的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

492. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. And it became so much a part of me.
→ {"text": "冥想已經變成我的一部分了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. I hated to miss those four days, but I was just so, so questioning myself, and if I should keep going with this.
→ {"text": "我很討厭錯過那四天，但我實在太過質疑自己了，質疑我是否應該繼續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. And it was a big question mark at that point.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，這是個很大的問號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. But the question remained.
→ {"text": "但問題依然存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. Can I do this again?
→ {"text": "我能再做一次嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. Can I meet this being?
→ {"text": "我能再見到這個存有嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. Can I ask him questions?
→ {"text": "我能問他問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. Because I really didn't get a lot of chance to talk and ask questions.
→ {"text": "因為我真的沒有太多機會說話和提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. It was more of him saying, hey, this, this, and this.
→ {"text": "更多是他在說，嘿，這個、這個和這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

503. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

504. Are your ears open?
→ {"text": "你的耳朵打開了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. Yes, they are open now.
→ {"text": "是的，現在它們打開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. So I go back, and I meditate.
→ {"text": "所以我回去了，我冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

507. You go through the 21 cycle.
→ {"text": "你經歷焦點 21。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

508. Yes, and I go past them.
→ {"text": "是的，然後我超越它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

509. Now the 22 cycles.
→ {"text": "現在是焦點 22 了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

510. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

511. So now you know how to get there through this--
→ {"text": "所以現在你知道如何透過這個——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

512. Easily now.
→ {"text": "現在很容易了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

513. Through this process.
→ {"text": "透過這個過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

514. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. And the part of me that was hesitant said, I'm just going to do it.
→ {"text": "而我內心猶豫的那部分說，我就去做吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. And I went past.
→ {"text": "然後我超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. I reconnected to him two or three times after that, just basic conversations.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我又重新連結他兩三次，只是基本的對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Who are you?
→ {"text": "你是誰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

519. And it was just as visceral as the first one?
→ {"text": "那跟第一次一樣真實強烈嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

520. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

521. Each time?
→ {"text": "每一次？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

522. Each one just as vividly as the last, just as real, just as strong.
→ {"text": "每一次都跟上一次一樣生動，一樣真實，一樣強烈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. Each time it got a little easier.
→ {"text": "每次都變得容易一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. But about the fourth or fifth time--
→ {"text": "但大概到第四或第五次——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

525. It got easier to get there, or just the whole experience?
→ {"text": "是到達那裡變容易了，還是整個體驗變容易了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

526. On my own sanity, on my questioning myself, it got a little easier.
→ {"text": "對於我自己的神智，對於質疑自己這件事，變得容易一點了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

527. I see. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

528. It wasn't so jolting.
→ {"text": "不再那麼震撼了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

529. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

531. And it was jolting the first time, the second, third.
→ {"text": "第一次、第二次、第三次都很震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. I go, and I-- the fourth, fifth time I go, and I ask him, how do I know you're real?
→ {"text": "我去了，然後我——第四次、第五次我去的時候，我問他，我怎麼知道你是真的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. How do I know I'm not going crazy?
→ {"text": "我怎麼知道我沒有發瘋？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. How do I know something's not wrong with my mind?
→ {"text": "我怎麼知道我的心智沒有出問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. And he said, talk to your friend.
→ {"text": "他說，去跟你的朋友談談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. And this is the same friend who I grew up with, the same friend, Scott, a dear friend of mine since we were kids.
→ {"text": "而這是我從小一起長大的同一個朋友，同一個朋友，Scott，從小就是我的摯友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

537. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

538. How do I know you're real?
→ {"text": "我怎麼知道你是真的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. He said, go talk to Scott.
→ {"text": "他說，去跟 Scott 談談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. And when you do, don't tell him about me, just talk to him as your friend.
→ {"text": "而當你這麼做的時候，不要跟他提到我，就當朋友跟他聊天就好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

541. And there should be something in there that will help you.
→ {"text": "裡面應該會有些什麼能幫助你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. And I go, OK.
→ {"text": "我說，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. No later than a day, my friend gets a hold of me, and says: Hey, I've got this really cool UFO documentary I've been watching.
→ {"text": "不到一天，我朋友就聯繫我，說：嘿，我正在看這部超酷的不明飛行物紀錄片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. It's really amazing.
→ {"text": "真的很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

545. He sends me the link to it, and I watch it.
→ {"text": "他把連結發給我，我就看了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. And on that documentary, they started talking about channeling.
→ {"text": "在那部紀錄片裡，他們開始談論通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. Now--
→ {"text": "現在——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

548. So you didn't know about channeling.
→ {"text": "所以你不知道通靈這回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

549. Nothing about channeling.
→ {"text": "完全不知道通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. I knew about mediumship from the church.
→ {"text": "我從教會那裡知道靈媒術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

551. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

552. That's what their whole deal was, but I never heard the term channeling.
→ {"text": "那就是他們的全部重點，但我從來沒聽過「通靈」這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. And although I had seen it in the church-- people getting messages directly through them-- I never knew exactly what it was.
→ {"text": "雖然我在教會裡見過——人們直接透過他們接收訊息——我從來不確切知道那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

554. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

555. I just thought that was that medium's way of bringing in the information.
→ {"text": "我只是以為那是那個靈媒帶入訊息的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

556. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

557. So I watch it.
→ {"text": "所以我看了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. And there's-- only out of the whole hour and a half documentary, it's like a five-minute clip.
→ {"text": "而且——在整個一個半小時的紀錄片中，只有大概五分鐘的片段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

559. And out of that, they talk about the Law of One, which was an ET contact channeling from the '80s, the "Law of One, Ra Material."
→ {"text": "在那段裡，他們談論一的法則，那是 80 年代的外星接觸通靈，「一的法則」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

560. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

561. Carla Rueckert and the crew.
→ {"text": "卡拉·魯克特和她的團隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

562. And during that time, they mentioned that.
→ {"text": "在那期間，他們提到了那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. And I'm sitting there in excitement, but not really knowing anything more about what I should be listening for.
→ {"text": "我興奮地坐在那裡，但並不真正知道我應該聽什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. And right at the end of it, this guy says: This, in my opinion, is the greatest channeling out there, second only to Jane Roberts and the "Seth Material."
→ {"text": "然後就在最後，這個人說：在我看來，這是最偉大的通靈，僅次於珍·羅伯茲和《賽斯資料》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. One sentence.
→ {"text": "一句話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. That sentence grabbed me more than the other five minutes of talking.
→ {"text": "那句話比其他五分鐘的談話更抓住我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

567. Right. >> So that's what I checked out.
→ {"text": "沒錯。所以那就是我查找的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. And now looking back, I know why, because the "Ra Material" was pretty far out there comparatively. The "Seth Material" was more mainstream.
→ {"text": "現在回想起來，我知道為什麼了，因為相較之下，《一的法則》太過遙遠。《賽斯資料》比較主流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. It was more about consciousness and evolution of the soul, which was what TReb had talked to me about.
→ {"text": "它更多是關於意識和靈魂的演化，那正是崔博跟我談論的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. So I locked into that.
→ {"text": "所以我鎖定了它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. I looked it up, got all the audio clips, downloaded the PDF.
→ {"text": "我查找它，取得所有音頻片段，下載了 PDF。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. All of these things online.
→ {"text": "所有這些東西都在網上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

573. From "Seth" and "Ra," or just the "Seth?"
→ {"text": "《賽斯》和《一的法則》，還是只有《賽斯》？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

574. Just the "Seth."
→ {"text": "只有《賽斯》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. The "Ra Material" was still out of my scope, off my radar.
→ {"text": "《一的法則》仍然超出我的範圍，不在我的雷達上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

576. Even though you've seen a big purple-eyed--
→ {"text": "即使你見過一個大大紫色眼睛的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

577. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. You would think that the rest would be OK, right?
→ {"text": "你會以為其他的都應該沒問題，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. And I never looked at it that way.
→ {"text": "而我從來沒有那樣看待它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. But I always know there was a reason.
→ {"text": "但我一直知道有個原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

581. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

582. And when I dug in, I found out what it was.
→ {"text": "當我深入挖掘時，我發現了它是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. Seth was saying the same thing that TReb said, just in different terms and different terminology.
→ {"text": "賽斯說的跟崔博說的是同樣的事情，只是用不同的詞語和術語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. And some of these terms were new to me.
→ {"text": "有些術語對我來說是新的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. And I had to really kind of focus.
→ {"text": "我必須真的專注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. Some of the words, I had no idea what they even meant, but I would go through, and I studied.
→ {"text": "有些詞，我完全不知道它們是什麼意思，但我還是看過去，然後我學習。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. And what it was, I am not a reader.
→ {"text": "事實是，我不是個愛閱讀的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. I don't read.
→ {"text": "我不閱讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. I listen, like audio books are my thing.
→ {"text": "我聽，像有聲書才是我的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

590. Same way.
→ {"text": "一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. I'm the same way.
→ {"text": "我也一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

592. It's a cognitive thing.
→ {"text": "這是認知的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

593. I've been audio-listening to your book.
→ {"text": "我一直在聽你書的有聲版。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

594. Nice.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

595. I have it in the PDF format, and I have it on my iPhone.
→ {"text": "我有 PDF 格式的，也存在我的 iPhone 上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. It's a process, but still, I can go through it much faster by listening to it.
→ {"text": "這是個過程，但我還是能透過聆聽更快地吸收它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

597. Oh, nice.
→ {"text": "噢，很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

598. I need a program like that too.
→ {"text": "我也需要那樣的程式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. It's helpful, to say the least.
→ {"text": "至少可以說很有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. That's how I retain that information.
→ {"text": "那就是我保留那些資訊的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. So I find this one little clip.
→ {"text": "所以我找到了這個小片段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. It's like an hour and 50 minutes.
→ {"text": "大概一小時五十分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. And it's excerpts of "Seth Speaks, the Eternal Validity of the Soul."
→ {"text": "那是《賽斯：靈魂永生》的摘錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

604. It's the clip on YouTube?
→ {"text": "是 YouTube 上的片段嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

605. There's one on YouTube, and there was one downloadable one that just had the excerpts from this guy who enjoyed that, he read, and it was professionally done.
→ {"text": "YouTube 上有一個，還有一個可下載的版本，就只有這個喜歡它的人朗讀的摘錄，做得很專業。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. And I listened to it, and it changed my whole perspective on a lot of stuff.
→ {"text": "我聽了它，它改變了我對很多事情的整個觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. And it was so powerful and so resonant with what TReb had already said to me.
→ {"text": "它如此有力，與崔博已經跟我說過的話如此共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. And when I heard that, it reconfirmed that maybe I wasn't making this stuff up in my head.
→ {"text": "當我聽到那個時，它再次確認了，也許我並不是在腦中編造這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

609. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

610. And this is something I never have said publicly before, but in that four-day period where I stayed away from the meditation and didn't go back to TReb, I actually went to the emergency room and said, I had this experience.
→ {"text": "這是我以前從未公開說過的事，但在那四天我遠離冥想、沒有回去見崔博的期間，我實際上去了急診室，說，我有過這個經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. I might be going crazy.
→ {"text": "我可能要發瘋了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

612. What did they say?
→ {"text": "他們怎麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

613. The doctor was cool.
→ {"text": "那個醫生很酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. He's like, you're playing around with those binaural beats.
→ {"text": "他說，你在玩那些雙耳節拍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. He goes, meditation, sometimes you go into a lot of subconscious places.
→ {"text": "他說，冥想，有時候你會進入很多潛意識的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. He said, you probably just had some kind of weird experience.
→ {"text": "他說，你可能只是有了某種奇怪的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. He said, I wouldn't worry about.
→ {"text": "他說，我不會擔心的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

618. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "噢，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

619. Which gave me relief.
→ {"text": "這讓我鬆了口氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

620. But you go like open the emergency doors, and say, I've seen a green, seven-foot tall, blue eyes.
→ {"text": "但你去推開急診室的門，說，我見過一個綠色的、七呎高、藍色眼睛的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. It's real.
→ {"text": "它是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. Gold boots, silver robe.
→ {"text": "金色靴子，銀色長袍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

623. They would have locked me up.
→ {"text": "他們會把我鎖起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

624. So you didn't go in that dramatic, that big.
→ {"text": "所以你不是那麼戲劇化、那麼誇張地進去的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

625. No, very lightly.
→ {"text": "不是，非常輕描淡寫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

626. You just signed the documents--
→ {"text": "你只是簽了文件——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

627. What are you here for?
→ {"text": "你來這裡做什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. I had an experience I need to talk to you about.
→ {"text": "我有個經歷需要跟你談談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

629. It was very nice though.
→ {"text": "不過很好的是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. He was cool.
→ {"text": "他很酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

631. All right.
→ {"text": "好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

632. If it would have been a different doctor--
→ {"text": "如果是另一個醫生的話——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

633. He didn't give you a shot and strap you to a bed, and hook you up to a bunch of machines.
→ {"text": "他沒有給你打針，把你綁在床上，再把你接上一堆機器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

634. I'm sure if I had another doctor.
→ {"text": "我確定如果是另一個醫生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

635. Yeah, if you got that wrong doctor, you probably--
→ {"text": "對，如果你遇到錯誤的醫生，你可能——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
