## Speaker Group 273

821. There's been some worlds that I've seen too before.

→ {"text": "我跟一些人談過，像是 CGI 藝術家，我說，我想把這個描述給你聽並製作出來，但那是個很龐大的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 274

826. Do you think then when CGI artists-- I used to run a visual effects company, so I know some of these model makers come out with these fascinating designs-- do you think they're actually tapping into some alternate planetary consciousness out there as opposed to it being originally created, or maybe pieces of different planetary consciousnesses?
→ {"text": "那你認為當 CGI 藝術家——我以前經營過視覺特效公司，所以我知道有些模型製作者會做出這些迷人的設計——你認為他們實際上是在接通某個外星球的意識，而不是原創的創造，或者可能是不同星球意識的片段？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 276

828. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

829. They're even-- and it's something like it's a conundrum where is it that everything exists, or is it that this universe is so big, that it has to exist somewhere?
→ {"text": "他們甚至——這有點像一個謎題，是所有東西都存在，還是說這個宇宙太大了，所以它必須存在於某處？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

830. Or is it just whatever you think, you create?
→ {"text": "還是說只要你想什麼，你就創造什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

831. It doesn't really matter, because what they're doing is real.
→ {"text": "這其實不重要，因為他們在做的事是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

832. I've seen some of the special effects stuff that people have done in movies or video games.
→ {"text": "我看過一些人在電影或電動遊戲中做的特效。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

833. And it's like, I've seen something almost exactly like that, or something very similar.
