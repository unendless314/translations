## Speaker Group 1

1. My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer and that is a clever name myself and Kalina fell into so it was a great synchronicity and the reason that it fits is because throughout the last 7 years I've contacted or channeled over 100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "我的名字是 Rob，我是外星耳語者（ET Whisperer），這個名字是我和卡莉娜（Kalina）無意間想到的，真是個美妙的共時性。之所以很適合，是因為在過去 7 年裡，我接觸或通靈了超過 100 個不同的外星意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. I've not done collective consciousnesses as much, but I have tapped into some of those, some Archangels but for some reason the ET thing sticks with me very well and it fits the energy very well so thats where I like to stay in My connection process is a little different than the rest of the channelers.
→ {"text": "我沒有太常接觸集體意識，但也接觸過一些，還有一些大天使。但不知為何，外星存有這部分跟我特別契合，能量也非常吻合，所以這是我喜歡專注的領域。我的連結過程跟其他通靈者有點不太一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. That seems a little odd to some people but basically what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna breathe for a little bit and then I'm gonna make some very loud Oming sounds and then I'm gonna breathe a little more, and then Aridif will join us.
→ {"text": "這對有些人來說可能有點奇怪，但基本上我接下來要做的是：我會先呼吸一會兒，然後發出一些很大聲的 Oming 聲音，接著再呼吸一會兒，然後阿里迪夫（Aridif）就會加入我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. The Oming sounds are resonant tuning.

→ {"text": "這些 Oming 聲會讓你的脈輪振動起來，這就是它如何幫助我連結到阿里迪夫的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. So enjoy yourself and remember every question you ask that's personal in nature is a reflection from your own consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以盡情享受吧，記住，每個你提出的個人本質的問題，都是來自你自己意識的反映。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "阿里迪夫會觀察你的能量，他會看到任何與之連結的能量——你的高我、你的超靈、大天使，不管是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "但首先，我們想討論你們所有人投入自身能量的這個宏大的共同創造——你們所有人都將自己的興奮、愛、時間和努力，投入到為你們經驗中的所有其他人，以及超越經驗之外的所有人，使其在今晚開花結果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. First of all, when all of you understand that many are aware of what is happening in this moment, in this time ...but there are many who have no concept or clue that this event in the way it is happening, is happening or that it is happening at all, in this evening.
→ {"text": "首先，當你們所有人理解到，許多人意識到此刻、此時正在發生什麼……但有許多人對於這個事件以它正在發生的方式發生，或者說它今晚正在發生這件事本身，完全沒有概念或線索。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構較複雜，保留了原文的強調語氣"}

→ {"text": "在每個當下，你看見自己與其他興奮匹配的人連結。你正在與那些不知道意識心態或「通靈」這個詞意味著什麼的實體共同創造經驗，但你仍然看到他們活躍起來，你看到他們的眼睛閃閃發光，你看到他們以自己的能力興奮起來，幫助共同創造更多興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我們不在意你如何處理我們給予你的愛，我們只是希望將這份愛送給你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. And this is why we express in all time periods that above all things that have been spoken of in this evening by ourselves is that you are loved is the most important point When you say the words that you are loved, it brings you an experience that feels different than when someone expresses that I love you.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我們在所有時期都表達，在今晚我們所說的所有事情之上，「你被愛著」是最重要的一點。當你說出「你被愛著」這句話時，它帶給你的體驗，與有人表達「我愛你」時的感受是不同的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. When I love you, this means that two separate entities that are segregated from one another share love and send it to another person who than accepts it but... ...when you are loved, then that is all that needs to be said.
→ {"text": "當「我愛你」時，這意味著兩個彼此分離的實體分享愛並將其送給另一個人，然後那個人接受它，但……當「你被愛著」時，那就是唯一需要說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. And you as a non-physical entity are aligned with that energy if you desire.
→ {"text": "而你作為一個非物質的實體，如果你渴望的話，就能與那能量對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. To realign with yourself, all you must do is open yourself for the experience.
→ {"text": "要重新與自己對齊，你所要做的就是為這個體驗敞開自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
