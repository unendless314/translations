## Speaker Group 1

1. My name is Rob and I am the ET Whisperer and that is a clever name myself and Kalina fell into so it was a great synchronicity and the reason that it fits is because throughout the last 7 years I've contacted or channeled over 100 diffrent ET consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "我叫羅伯，我是「外星耳語者」，這個名字是我和卡莉娜碰巧想到的，真是個美妙的共時性。之所以這麼稱呼我，是因為在過去七年裡，我接觸並通靈了超過一百個不同的外星意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. I've not done collective consciousnesses as much, but I have tapped into some of those, some Archangels but for some reason the ET thing sticks with me very well and it fits the energy very well so thats where I like to stay in My connection process is a little different than the rest of the channelers.
→ {"text": "我接觸集體意識的經驗不多，但也連結過一些，還有一些大天使，但不知為何，外星意識這塊特別適合我，能量非常契合，所以這是我喜歡專注的領域。我的連結過程跟其他通靈者有點不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. That seems a little odd to some people but basically what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna breathe for a little bit and then I'm gonna make some very loud Oming sounds and then I'm gonna breathe a little more, and then Aridif will join us.
→ {"text": "這對某些人來說可能有點怪，但基本上我會這樣做：我會先呼吸一會兒，然後發出一些很響的 Oming 聲音，再呼吸一會兒，然後阿里迪夫就會加入我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. The Oming sounds are resonant tuning.
→ {"text": "這些 Oming 聲音是一種共振調頻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. You guys can join along if you want.
→ {"text": "如果你們想的話，可以一起加入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. You guys can breathe all you want.
→ {"text": "你們可以盡情呼吸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. That Oming gets your Chakra's vibrating, and that's how it helps me connect to Aridif.
→ {"text": "那些 Oming 聲音會讓你的脈輪振動起來，這就是它如何幫助我連接到阿里迪夫的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. So enjoy yourself and remember every question you ask that's personal in nature is a reflection from your own consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以請放鬆享受，並記住，你提出的每個私人性質的問題，都是來自你自身意識的反映。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. And Aridif will look at your energy, he'll see any energy that it connects to, your higher self, your oversoul, Archangels, whatever.
→ {"text": "阿里迪夫會觀察你的能量，他會看到任何與之連結的能量——你的高我、你的超靈、大天使，任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. He'll see it connecting to it and then he will be able to reflect it back from his perception and his connections, so remember to have fun!
→ {"text": "他會看到能量如何連結，然後他能夠從他的感知和他的連結中將它反映回來，所以記得要玩得開心！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Remember to enjoy yourselves and...
→ {"text": "記得享受這個過程，還有⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": "句子未完整，原文如此"}

12. I love you guys.
→ {"text": "我愛你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
