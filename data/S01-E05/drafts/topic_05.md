318. So that led you into the channeling state?
→ {"text": "所以這讓你進入通靈狀態了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. Or did you get to talk to spirits, I should say?
→ {"text": "或者我應該說，你有跟靈體對話嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

320. I never got real contact with spirits in the way I wanted to.
→ {"text": "我從來沒有以我想要的方式真正與靈體接觸過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

321. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

322. But my belief system then was I should be hearing them in my ears, like audioclairancy or something.
→ {"text": "但我當時的信念系統認為，我應該能用耳朵聽見他們，像是聽覺靈通之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And that should be the experience.
→ {"text": "那應該就是那種體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. But I had gotten pictures or ideas.
→ {"text": "但我得到的是畫面或想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. And that really never happened in the Gateway Experience.
→ {"text": "而這在門戶體驗中真的從未發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. There were times where I was able--
→ {"text": "有些時候我能夠——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

327. Gateway is the church, or no?
→ {"text": "門戶是教會，還是不是？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

328. No, Gateway was the Hemi-Sync.
→ {"text": "不是，門戶是半腦同步技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

329. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

330. That part really never gave me any kind of spirit contact.
→ {"text": "那部分真的從未讓我與靈體有任何接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. Although, I do know that I was connecting to different energies.
→ {"text": "不過，我確實知道我在連結不同的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. Maybe not aware in the moment, questioning that.
→ {"text": "也許當下沒有意識到，質疑那件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. And that was something the church had helped me with before, to stop questioning myself, because that's a big, big part of tapping into your intuition.
→ {"text": "而這是教會之前幫助我的事情之一——停止質疑自己，因為這是連結你的直覺的非常、非常重要的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

334. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

335. So I go through these.
→ {"text": "所以我經歷了這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. And I get all sorts of experiences, out-of-body experiences, not controlled.
→ {"text": "我得到各式各樣的體驗、靈魂出竅體驗，但無法控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. And I still-- to this day, I can astral project, but I can't tell myself where to go.
→ {"text": "而我至今仍然——到今天，我可以進行星光體投射，但我無法告訴自己要去哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. I can't say, I want to go down the street and hang out in the bar in spirit form.
→ {"text": "我無法說，我想要以靈體形式走到街上，在酒吧閒逛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. I can't do that.
→ {"text": "我做不到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

340. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. But you can shoot out of your body.
→ {"text": "但你可以從身體裡彈射出去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

342. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "哦，可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

343. And then it just kind of--
→ {"text": "然後就只是那樣——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

344. Every time I connect in channeling, that's what I'm doing.
→ {"text": "我每次在通靈中連結時，就是在做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

345. And then you just-- it just floats around, and you're just kind of observing whatever appears to you?
→ {"text": "然後你就只是——它就這樣飄浮著，而你就只是觀察任何出現在你面前的東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. Or how does that--
→ {"text": "還是那是怎麼——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

347. Well, I've had experiences like that.
→ {"text": "嗯，我有過那樣的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. But most of time, it's like an experience going out into a different environment altogether.
→ {"text": "但大多數時候，那就像是一種進入完全不同環境的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. I've experienced other planets.
→ {"text": "我體驗過其他星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. I've experienced other parts of reality here, different times.
→ {"text": "我體驗過這裡實相的其他部分，不同的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. But how I connected to TReb was different.
→ {"text": "但我與崔博連結的方式不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. I had not had an out-of-body that was severely powerful or very, very deep in meaning to me.
→ {"text": "我從未有過如此極度強大、或對我來說意義如此、如此深刻的靈魂出竅體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. And I had a real messed up night that night.

354. I watched the Hubble Deep space thing for the first time, the 3D one that they had on YouTube.
→ {"text": "我第一次看了哈伯深空的那個影片，YouTube 上的 3D 版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

355. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "哦，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

356. And it touched my heart, but it kind of made me feel empty, like I can't go out there.
→ {"text": "它觸動了我的心，但也讓我感到有些空虛，就像我無法去到那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. I can't be a part of that.
→ {"text": "我無法成為那一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And it really kind of made me depressed a little.
→ {"text": "這真的讓我有點沮喪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. So I used a meditation.
→ {"text": "所以我用了冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. In the Hemi-Sync, they go through steps 1 through 21.
→ {"text": "在半腦同步技術中，他們會經過第 1 步到第 21 步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. And I decided one night, well, why don't I just go past 21.
→ {"text": "有一晚我決定，嗯，何不就超越 21 呢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. And that was that night of depression.
→ {"text": "而那就是那個沮喪的夜晚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. And that's when I met TReb.
→ {"text": "那時候我就遇見了崔博。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. And when I met TReb, it was--
→ {"text": "而當我遇見崔博時，那是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

365. Steps 1 through 21, and what do you mean by going past 21?
→ {"text": "第 1 步到第 21 步，你說超越 21 是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Do they have actually steps after 21?
→ {"text": "他們實際上有 21 之後的步驟嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

367. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

368. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

369. They do 1 through 21.
→ {"text": "他們做第 1 步到第 21 步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. And basically, when you're meditating, you're counting.
→ {"text": "基本上，當你冥想時，你在數數。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. It's a self-hypnosis.
→ {"text": "這是自我催眠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. That's what meditation is.
→ {"text": "冥想就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. It's a self-hypnosis.
→ {"text": "就是自我催眠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. And each step that you take, you go deeper in.
→ {"text": "而你走的每一步，你就會進入得更深。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. So step 1, you're starting to feel less your body, and then it goes on.
→ {"text": "所以第 1 步，你開始感覺不太到你的身體，然後繼續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. So I went past the 21.
→ {"text": "所以我超越了 21。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. And that's the maximum of the Gateway Experience, is the 21st-- They call it the 21 state.
→ {"text": "而那是門戶體驗的最高點，就是第 21——他們稱之為 21 狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

378. What's at 21?
→ {"text": "21 是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. Can you reveal what's at 21?
→ {"text": "你能透露 21 是什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

380. Well, 21 state is basically a full-blown conscious integration.
→ {"text": "嗯，21 狀態基本上是一種完全的意識整合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. You can connect with your higher self.
→ {"text": "你可以與你的高我連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. You can leave your body.
→ {"text": "你可以離開你的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. At that point, you're at the deepest level of consciousness available.
→ {"text": "在那個點上，你處於可達到的意識最深層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

384. And did you kind of in your own mind then say OK, we're going 22.
→ {"text": "那你是不是在自己心裡說，好吧，我們要去 22 了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

385. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. And I just-- and it wasn't even a number.
→ {"text": "而我只是——那甚至不是一個數字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. I didn't go 22, 23.
→ {"text": "我沒有去 22、23。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

388. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

389. I just went beyond.
→ {"text": "我只是超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. Now, it's time to go beyond.
→ {"text": "現在，是時候超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. And I did it in the moment.
→ {"text": "而我在那一刻就做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

392. Through the veil.
→ {"text": "穿過帷幕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

393. Not deciding before, in the moment, and that's when I connected to TReb, right then.
→ {"text": "不是事先決定的，而是在那一刻，那時候我就連結到崔博了，就在那時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

394. Wow!
→ {"text": "哇！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

395. Now when I'm connecting to TReb, this is very surreal.
→ {"text": "現在當我連結到崔博時，這非常超現實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. It's very realistic.
→ {"text": "非常真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. It's just like me and you sitting here talking today.
→ {"text": "就像我和你今天坐在這裡聊天一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. And that's the first time I'd ever left my body in such a fashion.
→ {"text": "那是我第一次以這種方式離開我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

399. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

400. Before when I left my body, there would be tracers or sound would be gone, or the images were blurry, or vibrating.
→ {"text": "以前當我離開身體時，會有殘影、或聲音會消失、或影像會模糊、或震動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. It was always different, but never this clear.
→ {"text": "總是有所不同，但從未如此清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. I was on a ship.
→ {"text": "我在一艘飛船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. I know that much now, because I've been back to those ships before.
→ {"text": "我現在知道這麼多，因為我之前回去過那些飛船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. It was one of the Yit ships, which is TReb's people.
→ {"text": "那是一艘伊特飛船，是崔博族群的飛船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. And I was sitting there in a room by myself.
→ {"text": "我獨自坐在一個房間裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. And eventually, through the door comes TReb.
→ {"text": "最後，崔博從門口進來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. And this, it scared the shit out of me.
→ {"text": "這真的把我嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. It was a horribly menacing being that was-- you're looking up to, 7 and 1/2 foot.
→ {"text": "那是一個極度威脅性的存有——你要抬頭仰望，7 呎半高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. I'm sitting in this chair, and I'm instantly transported sitting in a chair.
→ {"text": "我坐在這把椅子上，然後瞬間被傳送到坐在一把椅子上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. I always joke, it's like a futuristic space doctor waiting room, because you're just sitting there.
→ {"text": "我總是開玩笑說，那就像未來太空醫生的候診室，因為你就只是坐在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. And there is a sign that has this writing over here to the right.
→ {"text": "這裡右邊有個標誌，上面有文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. And it's not written in English.
→ {"text": "不是用英文寫的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. But after looking at it long enough, I could tell.
→ {"text": "但看了夠久之後，我能看出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. And it basically says something to the effect: Just sit here, and someone will be with you soon, type thing.
→ {"text": "基本上意思是：請坐在這裡，馬上就有人來找您，類似這樣的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. And I laughed about that.
→ {"text": "我對此笑了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. I still-- I don't know if I made--
→ {"text": "我至今——我不知道我是不是編造的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

417. You interpreted it.
→ {"text": "你詮釋了它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. You interpreted it as sit here.
→ {"text": "你詮釋為「坐在這裡」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

420. And I wait.
→ {"text": "然後我等待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. And this big gigantic reptilian, blue green, gigantic teeth, huge purple eyes, just comes through.
→ {"text": "然後這個巨大的爬蟲人，藍綠色的、巨大的牙齒、巨大的紫色眼睛，就這樣進來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

422. Now, I'll jump ahead just for a second.

## Speaker Group 110

428. Beyond psychedelic

## Speaker Group 111

429. Beyond anything you could ingest, entheogens, any of that.
→ {"text": "超越任何你能攝入的東西，致幻劑，任何那類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

430. Oh, wow.

431. The silver suit, he even wore a silver robe and gold boots.
→ {"text": "銀色的衣服，他甚至穿著銀色長袍和金色靴子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. And I'm thinking to myself, if I were trying to pull out the cheesiest space futuristic suit, what would it be?
→ {"text": "我心想，如果我要想出最俗氣的太空未來主義套裝，會是什麼樣子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. And that's it.

434. And that's what he was wearing.
→ {"text": "而那就是他穿的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

435. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. I was able to relax.

444. It was almost like-- I'm trying to think-- OK, it was almost like a sedative at the doctor, that just relaxed the body and the mind.
→ {"text": "那幾乎就像——我在想想——好，那幾乎就像在醫生那裡打的鎮靜劑，就只是讓身體和心智放鬆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. And then he came in.
→ {"text": "然後他進來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. And he said that he was connected to me, that me and him were connected and supposed to meet.
→ {"text": "他說他與我連結著，我和他是連結的，應該要見面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. He told me a lot of things that I think I know about reality aren't necessarily the way, there's a lot more to it.

## Speaker Group 116

451. All this in this one meeting?
→ {"text": "這些全都在這一次見面中？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

452. In the first meeting, and the first time I ever talked to him.

## Speaker Group 119

455. Now, I didn't have the terminology either.
→ {"text": "現在，我當時也沒有這些術語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

456. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

457. And the way telepathy works is that when-- they're using your words to try to convey a message.
→ {"text": "而心電感應的運作方式是——他們在使用你的詞彙來嘗試傳達訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. And you don't necessarily get words per se.
→ {"text": "而你不一定會得到真正的文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. It's just kind of a group thought.
→ {"text": "只是某種群體的思想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. All of this coming to me at once.
→ {"text": "所有這些一次湧向我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. And it was so overwhelming and so powerful that it was hard to remember a lot of the things that we talked about the first couple of times.
→ {"text": "那太overwhelming、太強大了，以至於很難記住我們前幾次談論的很多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. But the first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.
→ {"text": "但第一次，我記得就像昨天一樣清楚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. It was so clear.
→ {"text": "那非常清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. And he explains, it's not what you think, all these levels.
→ {"text": "他解釋說，這不是你想的那樣，所有這些層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. And he said, I'm here.
→ {"text": "他說，我在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. I'm here for you.
→ {"text": "我在這裡陪你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. If you want to connect to me, I'm here.
→ {"text": "如果你想與我連結，我就在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. And I left.
→ {"text": "然後我離開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. And now, at this time, when I started the Hemi-Sync, I was full-blast.
→ {"text": "而現在，在那個時候，當我開始半腦同步技術時，我是全力以赴的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. I'm three times a day meditation for an hour, an hour 25 each.
→ {"text": "我一天冥想三次，每次一小時、一小時二十五分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. Plus using closed-eye technique, where I'm just turning sounds into vibrations and energy, and understanding that.
→ {"text": "加上使用閉眼技法，我只是將聲音轉化為振動和能量，並理解那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. It's kind of a self-taught technique that I taught myself.
→ {"text": "那是一種我自學的技巧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

473. Basically, after learning these meditations I would utilize, I was hooked on meditation.
→ {"text": "基本上，在學會這些我會使用的冥想之後，我就迷上了冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. And in my mind, to miss a day of meditation is like missing breathing oxygen.
→ {"text": "在我心裡，錯過一天的冥想就像錯過呼吸氧氣一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. But after that, it was so intense and so odd, I skipped meditating for over four days before I reconnected.
→ {"text": "但在那之後，那太強烈、太奇怪了，我在重新連結之前跳過了超過四天的冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

476. After the TReb experience.
→ {"text": "在崔博的體驗之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

477. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. And after that point, I was hesitant to go back.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我猶豫是否要回去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. And I questioned myself more than I did just about any time in my life.
→ {"text": "我質疑自己的程度，超過我一生中幾乎任何時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. Even more than the--
→ {"text": "甚至超過——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
