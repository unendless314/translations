191. That's when I really started diving in.
→ {"text": "那時我才真正開始深入探索。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. One thing I always believed-- and science could not quench my hunger for the desire of how things started-- chemically, yes.
→ {"text": "有一件事我一直相信——而科學無法滿足我對萬物起源的渴望——化學上，可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. Engineering of the universe, sure.
→ {"text": "宇宙的工程學，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. But never that god that I knew was there.
→ {"text": "但永遠解釋不了我知道存在的那個神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

195. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

196. So that was the one thing I took into my beginning of this spiritual journey, god.
→ {"text": "所以那是我帶入這段靈性旅程開端的唯一東西，神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. And one thing too-- a lot of the times during my whole life, UFOs, ghosts, those two things were really something that my friend and I had talked about all the time.
→ {"text": "還有一件事——在我整個人生中，不明飛行物、鬼魂，這兩件事一直是我和朋友不斷談論的話題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. And there was never an explanation from the church or science for either one.
→ {"text": "而教會或科學從來都沒有為這兩者提供過解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. And the afterlife thing was always something that amazed me.
→ {"text": "來世這件事一直讓我著迷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. I'd seen these psychics on TV who said I can talk to spirits in the afterlife.
→ {"text": "我在電視上看過那些通靈者說我可以跟來世的靈魂交談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And I was very, very skeptical, to say the least.
→ {"text": "我非常、非常懷疑，至少可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. But some of the things they would say would be profound.
→ {"text": "但他們說的有些事情會很深刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. And I thought, that's a starting point.
→ {"text": "我想，那是個起點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. Let's look into that.
→ {"text": "我們來探索那個吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. I found a church that integrated their desire to look on the other side of death, so that they could bring answers from the other side.
→ {"text": "我找到一個教會，他們將探索死後世界的渴望融入教會，這樣他們就能從另一邊帶回答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And they believe in God.
→ {"text": "他們相信神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. And they followed a bit of the Bible too, which was a comfort zone, I guess, for me from my childhood belief.
→ {"text": "他們也有點遵循聖經，我猜這對我來說是個舒適圈，來自我童年的信仰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. So I jumped in.
→ {"text": "所以我就投入了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. And when I went there, they taught me meditation.
→ {"text": "當我去到那裡時，他們教我冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. Right off the bat, I got a reading from the person, the deacon, or the pastor, whatever title he had, and it was spot on.
→ {"text": "一開始，我就從那個人那裡得到了靈性解讀，不管他是執事還是牧師，不管他的頭銜是什麼，解讀非常準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. He didn't know me.
→ {"text": "他不認識我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. No one from the church knew me.
→ {"text": "教會裡沒有人認識我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. No one had my social media profile.
→ {"text": "沒有人有我的社群媒體資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. But yet, they told me things about my son.
→ {"text": "但他們卻告訴了我關於我兒子的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. And they told me things about relatives that, at first, I had no clue.
→ {"text": "他們還告訴我關於親戚的事情，一開始我完全不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. But when I went to my dad, who follows genealogy and our family tree. He said: Wow, this person from six generations ago had this and this.
→ {"text": "但當我去問我父親，他研究家譜和家族樹。他說：哇，六代之前的這個人有這個和那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. So it was perfect.
→ {"text": "所以非常完美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

218. So it matched up.
→ {"text": "所以對上了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

219. Synchronicity.
→ {"text": "共時性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. And it hit me so hard that he could have that kind of information.
→ {"text": "他能擁有那種資訊，這強烈地震撼了我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. That drew a level of reality to me.
→ {"text": "那為我帶來了一層真實感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. It drew some realness to it.
→ {"text": "這讓它變得真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

223. Well, just to back up.
→ {"text": "嗯，我先倒回去一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. When you said you started noticing the animals or I guess your perspective on animals had changed, was there a specific event or something that made that happen, or did it just happen?
→ {"text": "你說你開始注意到動物，或者我猜你對動物的看法改變了，有什麼特定的事件促成這件事，還是就這樣發生的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

225. It was a lot of little things.
→ {"text": "是很多小事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. For instance, the way my dogs would come to me, instead of just kind of-- they would always come to get petted or something, but they would come and spend time with me.
→ {"text": "比如說，我的狗狗來找我的方式，不只是那種——他們一直會來討摸或什麼的，但他們會來跟我待在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Little things like that.
→ {"text": "就是這樣的小事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

228. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

229. Going out in the woods.
→ {"text": "去森林裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. As a younger person, I hunted.
→ {"text": "年輕的時候，我會打獵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. It's Michigan culture.
→ {"text": "這是密西根文化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

232. Yeah. >> I was raised here.
→ {"text": "對。我在這裡長大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "兩個說話者快速對話"}


## Speaker Group 41

233. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

234. So I hunted all the time.
→ {"text": "所以我一直在打獵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. And the last time I went hunting was right around that time.
→ {"text": "我最後一次打獵就是在那段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. I had a deer right in my sights.
→ {"text": "我瞄準了一隻鹿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. I actually fell asleep in the woods.
→ {"text": "我其實在森林裡睡著了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. And I woke up, and this deer is five foot from me.
→ {"text": "然後我醒來，這隻鹿離我只有五英尺遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And I had my gun, unlocked the trigger, put it right on the deer, and I couldn't pull the trigger.
→ {"text": "我拿起我的槍，解鎖扳機，瞄準那隻鹿，但我扣不下扳機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. And after that, I never went back out in the woods.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我再也沒去過森林。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. Those types of things.
→ {"text": "就是這些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Very hard, very big.
→ {"text": "非常困難、非常重大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. But a lot of little things that led up to it that really made me understand what that connection was a bit more than just the animal-human perspective that Christianity, and just humans in general, believe in.
→ {"text": "但很多累積起來的小事，真的讓我理解到那種連結是什麼，遠超越基督教、以及人類整體所相信的那種動物—人類觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

244. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. I remember you mentioned before that you had gotten involved with some recordings from the Monroe Institute.
→ {"text": "我記得你之前提到過，你接觸了門羅研究所的一些錄音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

246. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. I would meditate all the time.
→ {"text": "我一直在冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. And I kept gaining more experiences.
→ {"text": "我持續獲得更多體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. And I finally just kind of pooped out on it, and it just stopped.
→ {"text": "然後我最後就有點精疲力盡了，就停了下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. After that, I started looking online.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我開始上網搜尋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. And that's when I found the Monroe Institute.
→ {"text": "那時我找到了門羅研究所。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. I found some binaural stuff.
→ {"text": "我找到一些雙耳節拍的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. And then I found Hemi-Sync, which was the biggest and best out there.
→ {"text": "然後我找到半腦同步技術，據說是最大也最好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. It's what was claimed.
→ {"text": "就是這樣宣稱的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

255. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

256. I started the Gateway Experience course, which was a six course-- six part per course, and then six courses of meditation, which increased my meditation ability tremendously.
→ {"text": "我開始了門戶體驗課程，這是個六套課程——每套課程有六個部分，然後是六套冥想課程，這大幅提升了我的冥想能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. This is where all of the astral projection states come in.
→ {"text": "所有的星光體投射狀態都是從這裡來的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. This is where all of the out of body experiences-- it took my meditation to such a level beyond anything I thought was possible at that point.
→ {"text": "所有的靈魂出竅體驗都是從這裡來的——這把我的冥想帶到了一個遠超我當時認為可能的水平。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. I had only used meditation before to try to open myself for communication with spirits, dead humans.
→ {"text": "我之前只用冥想來嘗試打開自己，與靈魂、已故的人類溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. That's all I cared about.
→ {"text": "那是我唯一在意的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

261. Oh, you did.
→ {"text": "噢，你有啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

263. That was my intent in my meditation.
→ {"text": "那是我冥想的意圖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

264. When you were in church, still with the church?
→ {"text": "當你還在教會的時候，還在教會裡時？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

265. Yes. >> OK.
→ {"text": "對。好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. The, the spirits was what their church was involved with.
→ {"text": "靈魂，靈魂是他們教會專注的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. That was the whole focal point of their church, was to communicate with people who had died to give proof of afterlife.
→ {"text": "那是他們教會的整個焦點，就是與已故的人溝通，以提供來世的證明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

268. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

269. And that was important to me.
→ {"text": "那對我很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. And I thought that wasn't the only intent for meditation.
→ {"text": "我想那不是冥想的唯一意圖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

271. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

272. My meditation came because, like drugs helped pull me out of pain and suffering, this new excitement I found whenever I would start to go down and start to feel a little cruddy or start getting back in those low points again, I would use meditation.
→ {"text": "我開始冥想是因為，就像藥物幫助我擺脫痛苦和折磨一樣，每當我開始低落、開始感覺有點糟糕、或開始回到那些低點時，我發現了這個新的興奮來源，我會用冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. And it brought me to a new level of feeling good, and excited, and clear.
→ {"text": "它把我帶到一個新的水平，感覺良好、興奮、清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. And I used it like I used to use drugs, several times a day, as much as I could.
→ {"text": "我像以前用藥物一樣使用它，一天好幾次，盡可能多次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. The quantity, the quality was important to me.
→ {"text": "數量、品質對我都很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. So I kept using meditation as a tool to help alleviate all that stress and stuff.
→ {"text": "所以我持續用冥想作為工具，來幫助緩解所有那些壓力和東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. So that coupled with that contact of people who had passed on.
→ {"text": "所以那個，再加上與已故之人的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. Those were the real focus points of my meditation.
→ {"text": "那些是我冥想的真正焦點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. And the Hemi-Sync took me above and beyond that.
→ {"text": "而半腦同步技術把我帶到遠超那個境界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

280. And can you describe how it did that?
→ {"text": "那你能描述一下它是怎麼做到的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. Or is that something you have to buy the Hemi-Sync and go through?
→ {"text": "還是說你必須購買半腦同步技術然後親自體驗？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. Is there--
→ {"text": "是不是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": "句子未完"}


## Speaker Group 56

283. It's a several step process.
→ {"text": "這是個多步驟的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. So the teachings are just tools to use.
→ {"text": "所以這些教學只是工具。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. And the vibration sounds, basically, they sync up your hemispheres of the brain.
→ {"text": "而振動聲音，基本上，它們會同步你的大腦半球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

286. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. Yeah, because binaural beats and Hemi-Sync, it's based on the same concept of different tones in different ears.
→ {"text": "對，因為雙耳節拍和半腦同步技術，都是基於在不同耳朵播放不同音調的相同概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

288. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. And some of them, and not Hemi-Sync.
→ {"text": "有些是這樣，但半腦同步技術不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. I used other ones.
→ {"text": "我用過其他的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. But Hemi-Sync was the one that gave me technique.
→ {"text": "但半腦同步技術是給我技巧的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Those teach you techniques.
→ {"text": "那些會教你技巧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

294. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

295. They teach you healing, out-of-body, communication with spirit, all of those.
→ {"text": "他們教你療癒、靈魂出竅、與靈魂溝通，所有這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. And with those, I was able to jump through.
→ {"text": "有了這些，我能夠跳躍前進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. Now, the experiences themselves were so vast, and different kinds of experiences.
→ {"text": "現在，這些體驗本身非常廣闊，有各種不同的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. The first day I started, there was a vibration in my body I never felt before.
→ {"text": "我開始的第一天，我的身體有一種我從未感受過的振動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. It made my whole body [BUZZING].
→ {"text": "它讓我整個身體【嗡嗡作響】。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. And the chakras were just high vibrational.
→ {"text": "而脈輪就是高振動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. And those types of experiences were what hooked me in right away.
→ {"text": "這些類型的體驗就是立刻吸引我的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

302. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

303. I was skeptical, to say the least.
→ {"text": "至少可以說，我是懷疑的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. So I started with my first one saying, well, we'll see what it does.
→ {"text": "所以我開始第一個的時候說，嗯，我們看看它有什麼效果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. And the first one was a hit.
→ {"text": "第一個就成功了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. So I just kept going.
→ {"text": "所以我就繼續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

307. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

308. The experience itself-- normally, I suggest to people, if you do the Hemi-Sync, go through it at your own pace.
→ {"text": "體驗本身——通常，我建議人們，如果你要做半腦同步技術，按照你自己的節奏進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. But I would suggest no less than six months, no less than a year to go through all six.
→ {"text": "但我會建議不少於六個月，不少於一年，來完成全部六套。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. For me, I jumped through them in four months.
→ {"text": "對我來說，我在四個月內跳完了它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

311. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

312. And I thought it was way too quick.
→ {"text": "我覺得那太快了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. But everything happens for a reason.
→ {"text": "但凡事都有原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

314. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

315. And it worked out well.
→ {"text": "而且結果很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
