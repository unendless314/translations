→ {"text": "在每個當下，你看到自己與興奮感相符的其他人連結。你與那些並不了解有意識心態或「通靈」這個詞意義的實體共同創造體驗，但你看到他們變得生動起來，看到他們眼中的光芒，看到他們在自己的能力範圍內產生興奮，幫助共同創造更多的興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我們不介意你如何處理我們給你的愛，我們只是希望送給你這份愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. And this is why we express in all time periods that above all things that have been spoken of in this evening by ourselves is that you are loved is the most important point When you say the words that you are loved, it brings you an experience that feels different than when someone expresses that I love you.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我們在所有時期都表達：在今晚我們自己所說的一切之上，「你被愛著」是最重要的一點。當你說出「你被愛著」這句話時，它帶給你的體驗感受，與某人表達「我愛你」時的感受是不同的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. When I love you, this means that two separate entities that are segregated from one another share love and send it to another person who than accepts it but... ...when you are loved, then that is all that needs to be said.
→ {"text": "當「我愛你」，這意味著兩個彼此分離的個體分享愛並將它送給另一個接收它的人，但⋯⋯當「你被愛著」，那就是所有需要說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "愛環繞著你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. If you desire it, you can accept it and manifest with it.

45. Love is what creation is.
→ {"text": "愛就是創造的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. It is what all consciousness is made from.
→ {"text": "它是所有意識的組成元素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. And you as a non-physical entity are aligned with that energy if you desire.
→ {"text": "而你作為一個非物質實體，如果你渴望，就能與那能量對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. To realign with yourself, all you must do is open yourself for the experience.
→ {"text": "要重新與自己對齊，你所需要做的就是為這個體驗敞開自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Now a part of that experience is understanding things upon a deeper level.
→ {"text": "而這個體驗的一部分，是在更深層次上理解事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. So what we can share with you in this evening is perhaps give you a reflection on the questions you desire in order to co-create a better understanding for you to open your own energy up to the more love around you if you desire.
→ {"text": "所以我們今晚能與你們分享的，也許是針對你們渴望的問題給予反映，以便共同創造更好的理解，讓你們——如果你們渴望——向周圍更多的愛敞開自己的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
