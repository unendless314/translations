73. Well, it's a bit of a story.
→ {"text": "嗯，這說來話長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. I always love explaining it.
→ {"text": "我一直很喜歡講這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. But first, I was a kid growing up in a family that was really Christian.
→ {"text": "首先，我從小在一個非常虔誠的基督教家庭長大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. And Christianity was a big, big part of my life as a child, growing up into a younger teenager.
→ {"text": "基督教在我的童年時期，一直到青少年早期，都是我生活中非常、非常重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. At about 13, which is the natural time of rebellion for most, I kind of went through this experience where I separated myself from it.
→ {"text": "大約在 13 歲時，也就是大多數人自然的叛逆期，我經歷了一段讓自己與基督教分離的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. Growing up, I had all these questions.
→ {"text": "在成長過程中，我有很多疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. And every time I would ask the preacher or a person esteemed on the board of the church directors, or whoever, just someone who is knowledgeable, they never could really give an answer that was complete to me.
→ {"text": "每次我問牧師、或是教會董事會中受人尊敬的人、或是任何人——只要是有知識的人，他們從來沒辦法給我一個真正完整的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. It always seemed like it just went back to, because the Bible says so, or because the church says so.
→ {"text": "他們的回答似乎總是回到「因為聖經是這麼說的」，或是「因為教會是這麼說的」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. And I had a friend who would go with me.
→ {"text": "我有一個朋友會跟我一起去教會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. And we were both pretty critical of the whole thing.
→ {"text": "我們兩個對整件事都抱持相當批判的態度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. So after exploring that, I kind of did my own thing.
→ {"text": "所以在探索之後，我開始做自己的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. I let science be a big part of what my reality was at that point.
→ {"text": "我讓科學成為我當時實相的重要部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. In school, I did pretty well with science.
→ {"text": "在學校裡，我的科學成績相當不錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. I enjoyed it.
→ {"text": "我很喜歡科學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. Earth science, especially.
→ {"text": "尤其是地球科學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. And going through that time period, I distanced myself more and more from the church.
→ {"text": "在那段時期，我離教會越來越遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. After a few years, I just quit going.
→ {"text": "幾年後，我就完全不去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. And not to my mother's liking either.
→ {"text": "這也讓我媽媽很不高興。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. But we just kept going through.
→ {"text": "但我們還是繼續往前走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. And after a few years of just being off and about, I started going through a real, real rebellious stage.
→ {"text": "在經歷幾年漫無目的的日子後，我開始進入一個真正、真正的叛逆階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. And that was a very disconnected time in my life.
→ {"text": "那是我人生中非常斷連的一段時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. I hung out with a lot of people who-- they did the gang things in the '90s.
→ {"text": "我跟很多人混在一起，他們在 1990 年代做幫派的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. So violence was part of that.
→ {"text": "所以暴力是其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. Drugs.
→ {"text": "還有毒品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. All of those things were a big part.
→ {"text": "所有這些都是重要的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. I started smoking a lot of pot.
→ {"text": "我開始大量吸大麻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. It wasn't an expansive thing.
→ {"text": "那不是為了擴展意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. It was fun.
→ {"text": "只是為了好玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. So it was in my destructive--
→ {"text": "所以那是在我的破壞性——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

102. It was a party thing.
→ {"text": "是派對娛樂的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

103. Yes, it was.
→ {"text": "對，就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

105. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. Not Native American going into the woods and--
→ {"text": "不是像美洲原住民那樣走進森林——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

107. No drumming circle.
→ {"text": "沒有鼓圈儀式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

108. No drumming circle, calling in the Great Spirit Bear.
→ {"text": "沒有鼓圈，也沒有召喚大靈熊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

109. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. But there were a lot of bears there, just the wrong kind.
→ {"text": "但那裡確實有很多「熊」，只是種類不對。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "可能指警察（俚語）或其他負面意涵"}


## Speaker Group 10

111. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對對對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

112. And it was fun.
→ {"text": "那很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. And it was violent, destructive.
→ {"text": "也很暴力、很具破壞性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. And it was a big part of my life.
→ {"text": "那是我生活中很重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. And I went that way until right around the time before I found out my son was going to be on his way.
→ {"text": "我就這樣過下去，直到發現我兒子即將到來之前的那段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And I just kind of quit hanging out with people a few months before then.
→ {"text": "在那之前幾個月，我就不再跟那些人混了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. Maybe it was intuition, looking back.
→ {"text": "回想起來，也許那是直覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

118. A big responsibility coming.
→ {"text": "有個重大的責任要來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

119. Well, it was the first time in my life I looked at an aspect of something that wasn't myself.
→ {"text": "嗯，那是我人生中第一次看向不是我自己的某個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. Everything was centered around myself.
→ {"text": "之前一切都是以我自己為中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. Even though I had people who I loved and were a part of my life, up until then, it was just me.
→ {"text": "儘管我有愛的人，他們也是我生活的一部分，但在那之前，就只有我自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. And knowing this responsibility-- the moment of change really didn't come till the day he was born.
→ {"text": "而且知道這個責任——真正的轉變時刻直到他出生那天才到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. He was born with a lot of physical problems.
→ {"text": "他出生時有很多生理問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Cerebral palsy.
→ {"text": "腦性麻痺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

125. Did you know that right away, right when he was born?
→ {"text": "你當時就知道了嗎？他一出生就知道？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

126. Not to the extent, no.
→ {"text": "不知道嚴重程度，不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. They told us that he had problems.
→ {"text": "他們告訴我們他有問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. So when he came out, he did not have any breath on his own.
→ {"text": "所以他出來的時候，完全無法自己呼吸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. They had to hook him up to machines.
→ {"text": "他們必須把他接到機器上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. So I knew that there was an issue.
→ {"text": "所以我知道有問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. But I didn't know the extent of the issue.
→ {"text": "但我不知道問題有多嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

132. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

133. They basically sent us home and said, here's some medicine.
→ {"text": "他們基本上就讓我們回家，說，這是一些藥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. There's a possibility he might have seizures.
→ {"text": "他可能會癲癇發作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. We've seen some brain waves that weren't normal.
→ {"text": "我們看到一些不正常的腦波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. So they sent me back.
→ {"text": "所以他們就讓我回去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. And I took care of him.
→ {"text": "然後我照顧他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. And I didn't really know the extent of how bad it was until he started missing all the physical marks. Like they'll say at six months he's supposed to lift his head, and at three months, to do this.
→ {"text": "我真的不知道有多糟，直到他開始錯過所有的生理發展指標。像是他們會說六個月應該要能抬頭，三個月要能做這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. And he missed all of them.
→ {"text": "他全部都沒達到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

140. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

141. When he was about two years old, we took him back to the doctor.
→ {"text": "當他大約兩歲的時候，我們帶他回去看醫生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. And that's when I really knew.
→ {"text": "那時候我才真正知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And that's when the depression in myself really started.
→ {"text": "那時候我的憂鬱症才真正開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. That's when the true disconnection that I'd experienced actually happened.
→ {"text": "那時候我經歷的真正斷連才真的發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

145. You were disconnected-- just the whole experience, having a son in this state, it was just hard to cope with?
→ {"text": "你感到斷連——整個經驗，有一個處於這種狀態的兒子，很難應對？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

146. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. It's the thought of knowing.
→ {"text": "是那種「知道」的念頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And when they tell me, they don't tell me, hey, your son has a problem.
→ {"text": "當他們告訴我時，他們不是說，嘿，你兒子有個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. They're like, he has severe problems.
→ {"text": "他們是說，他有嚴重的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. He'll never walk.
→ {"text": "他永遠不會走路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. He'll never talk.
→ {"text": "他永遠不會說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. He'll probably be like a vegetable.
→ {"text": "他可能會像植物人一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. And that's pretty much how the doctor explained that.
→ {"text": "醫生基本上就是這樣解釋的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

154. Man.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. Doctors.
→ {"text": "這些醫生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

156. Yeah, no bedside manner.
→ {"text": "對，完全沒有床邊關懷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. I know.
→ {"text": "我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

158. And then I guess, they always say, well, we're trained to tell you the worst in case.
→ {"text": "然後我想，他們總是說，嗯，我們被訓練要告訴你最壞的情況以防萬一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. And that's not a good training.
→ {"text": "那不是一個好的訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

160. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. Well, knowing what we know now and what we thought, it's bad.
→ {"text": "嗯，從我們現在知道的和當時的想法來看，那很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. So it hit me like a ton of bricks.
→ {"text": "所以那像一噸磚頭一樣砸在我身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

163. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

165. It was something that I made myself try to cope with, but I could not on my own.
→ {"text": "那是我強迫自己試著去應對的事，但我無法靠自己做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

166. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

167. I didn't have any spiritual things in my life.
→ {"text": "我的生活中沒有任何靈性的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. Before all I could depend on was pot.
→ {"text": "以前我唯一能依靠的就是大麻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. And that's what helped take the edge off throughout my whole teens and young 20's.
→ {"text": "那是幫助我在整個青少年時期和二十出頭緩解壓力的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. So from the time I found out that my son's mother was pregnant to the time he was two, I had really pulled away from my old lifestyle.
→ {"text": "所以從我發現我兒子的母親懷孕，到他兩歲的這段時間，我真的遠離了我的舊生活方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. But now I immersed back in it triplefold.
→ {"text": "但現在我又沉浸其中，而且是三倍的程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. So it was more disconnection than I ever experienced.
→ {"text": "所以那是我經歷過最嚴重的斷連。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. More-- my mind's going crazy all the time.
→ {"text": "更多的——我的心智一直在瘋狂運轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. No mental focus whatsoever.
→ {"text": "完全沒有心智專注力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. So I go through that.
→ {"text": "所以我經歷了那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. And it got real bad into the depths of all sorts of things.
→ {"text": "然後情況變得非常糟糕，陷入各種深淵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. I even got into severe drug use and pain-- I started with pain management for a car crash I got into, and it spiraled downhill to the worst case scenario.
→ {"text": "我甚至開始嚴重使用毒品和止痛藥——我是從一次車禍後的疼痛管理開始的，然後一路螺旋下墜到最糟糕的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. And after that, I spent many years just kind of existing.
→ {"text": "在那之後，我花了很多年只是存在著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. If I didn't get medicine, I would be sick.
→ {"text": "如果我沒有藥，我就會生病。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. And my life really did a tilt-a-whirl on me.
→ {"text": "我的人生真的在我身上轉了個天旋地轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

181. Right.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

182. And that was the worst time of my life.
→ {"text": "那是我人生中最糟糕的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. And about seven years into it, maybe less than that, of really bad, bad disconnection depression, I finally started coming out of it.
→ {"text": "在那段非常、非常糟糕的斷連憂鬱中大約七年之後，也許更短，我終於開始走出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. And I went through a lot of steps to get there.
→ {"text": "我經歷了很多步驟才到達那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. But the last step included me actually starting to see life again, and starting to see-- and this is when I really honed in on nature, and I honed in on the animals.
→ {"text": "但最後一步包括我真正開始重新看見生命，開始看見——這時候我真的聚焦在大自然上，聚焦在動物上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. Before I had pets, but I never had an animal that was connected to me.
→ {"text": "以前我有寵物，但我從來沒有與我真正連結的動物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. I'd never seen it as an equal, I'd seen it as property.
→ {"text": "我從來沒有把牠們視為平等的存在，我把牠們視為財產。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. Those little changes subtly creeped in.
→ {"text": "那些小小的變化悄悄地滲透進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. And overnight it was just an amazing difference in perception, an amazing difference in the way I felt.
→ {"text": "然後在一夜之間，我的感知出現了驚人的差異，我的感受方式出現了驚人的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. And that's when my true spiritual journey began.
→ {"text": "那時候，我真正的靈性旅程才開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
