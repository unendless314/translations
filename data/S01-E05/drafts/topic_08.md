## Speaker Group 280

841. So you spend two years going to this world, having these conversations.
→ {"text": "所以你花了兩年時間前往這個世界，進行這些對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

842. And it's your idea then to finally talk to TReb and say, hey, why don't we try this whole channeling thing?
→ {"text": "然後是你的主意，最後去跟崔博說，嘿，我們何不試試這整個通靈的事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

843. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

844. And what does he say?
→ {"text": "然後他怎麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

845. Of course, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "當然，我確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

846. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

847. He said, yeah.
→ {"text": "他說，好啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

848. That's one of the paths we can take.
→ {"text": "那是我們可以走的路徑之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

849. Awesome.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

850. And did he give you tips on how to do it?
→ {"text": "那他有給你如何做的訣竅嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

851. Or were you, by this time, versed enough to say, OK, this is what we've got to do, TReb.
→ {"text": "還是說到了這個時候，你已經夠熟練了，可以說，好，崔博，這就是我們要做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

852. How did that work?
→ {"text": "那是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

853. No, it's actually a combination of the two.
→ {"text": "不，實際上是兩者的結合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

854. And it was never me going, hey, I think this will work.
→ {"text": "而且從來不是我自己說，嘿，我覺得這會有用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

855. I went out on the internet.
→ {"text": "我上網去查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

856. Obviously, the internet was great.
→ {"text": "顯然，網路很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

857. There wasn't a lot of stuff there.
→ {"text": "那時候上面沒有太多資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

858. So I searched out psychic mediums.
→ {"text": "所以我搜尋了通靈媒介。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

859. I knew a guy who worked with the team of the "Law of One" material, that after the "Law Of One" material was written, he worked closely with the main channeler there, Carla Rueckert.
→ {"text": "我認識一個人，他曾與《一的法則》資料的團隊合作，在《一的法則》資料寫成之後，他與那裡的主要通靈者 Carla Rueckert 密切合作過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

860. So I worked with him and talked to him.
→ {"text": "所以我跟他一起合作，跟他聊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

861. And he gave me a lot of really great information.
→ {"text": "他給了我很多非常棒的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

862. I had looked up online a couple of channeling books.
→ {"text": "我在網上查到了幾本通靈的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

863. And now I realize, probably, some of the same people that I'm aware of today and just didn't know was them back then.
→ {"text": "現在我才意識到，可能有些就是我今天知道的同一批人，只是當時不知道是他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

864. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

865. And worked with TReb.
→ {"text": "然後跟崔博一起合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

866. And TReb helped me out with a lot.
→ {"text": "崔博幫了我很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

867. And then I just kind of borrowed a little from everything until it was perfect.
→ {"text": "然後我就從各種地方借鑑一點點，直到達到完美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

868. And then I found my own mix.
→ {"text": "然後我找到了自己的混合方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

869. It was a garden variety of a little bit of everything.
→ {"text": "這是各種東西的大雜燴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

870. What got you through?
→ {"text": "是什麼讓你成功了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

871. What was the catalyst to bring TReb through?
→ {"text": "讓崔博現身的催化劑是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

872. What was your first channeling experience, I guess?
→ {"text": "我想，你的第一次通靈經驗是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

873. Well, my first channeling experience, I set up a camera.
→ {"text": "嗯，我第一次通靈經驗，我架了一台攝影機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

874. My then wife was there to kind of monitor me and make sure nothing went too crazy.
→ {"text": "我當時的妻子在那裡監看我，確保不會發生太瘋狂的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

875. That was a concern of mine.
→ {"text": "那是我的一個擔憂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

876. I got this entity coming in my body.
→ {"text": "我讓這個實體進入我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

877. I don't want to lose control or-- you know, the Christian part of my mind...
→ {"text": "我不想失控，或者——你知道的，我心智中基督教的那部分……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

878. Hulk out!
→ {"text": "變綠巨人浩克！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

879. You have this big green alien coming through you, you might. Did that ever go through you mind?
→ {"text": "你有這個巨大的綠色外星人通過你現身，你可能會。那有沒有在你腦海中閃過？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

880. A little bit of that.
→ {"text": "有一點點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

881. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

882. At that point, I trusted TReb.
→ {"text": "到了那個時候，我信任崔博。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

883. I'd come to love him like a dear friend.
→ {"text": "我已經愛他如同親密的朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

884. But there's still the unknown.
→ {"text": "但仍然有未知的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

885. Why would this entity come and choose me out of everybody?
→ {"text": "為什麼這個實體會來，從所有人中選擇我？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

886. Why?
→ {"text": "為什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

887. My Christian beliefs tapped on my shoulder a few times.
→ {"text": "我的基督教信仰拍了幾次我的肩膀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

888. So I wanted to be careful.
→ {"text": "所以我想要小心謹慎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

889. I wanted to be good.
→ {"text": "我想要做好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

890. I recorded myself, and it was amazingly horrible.
→ {"text": "我錄下了自己，結果糟糕得驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

891. Amazingly horrible.
→ {"text": "糟糕得驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

892. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

893. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

894. Can you describe amazingly horrible?
→ {"text": "你能形容一下糟糕得驚人是什麼樣嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

895. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

896. The voice that people hear TReb now, even if they go back four years, it's not the same.
→ {"text": "人們現在聽到的崔博的聲音，即使回到四年前，也不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

897. It's a little different.
→ {"text": "有點不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

898. And the accent's the same, the type of talking that he uses.
→ {"text": "口音是一樣的，他使用的說話方式也一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

899. But the inflections are different.
→ {"text": "但抑揚頓挫不同了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

900. And the yeses are much more vibrant.
→ {"text": "而且那些「yes」更有活力了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

901. And like when he says, yes-- that "ye-e-e-s", really excited-- that wasn't there then.
→ {"text": "像是當他說「yes」——那種「ye-e-e-s」，真的很興奮——那時候還沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

902. It was very flat and monotone, and kind of filtery too.
→ {"text": "那時候非常平淡單調，而且有點像被過濾過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

903. There was just-- I could tell all of TReb wasn't getting in.
→ {"text": "就是——我能感覺到崔博並沒有完全進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

904. So I practiced a few more times.
→ {"text": "所以我又練習了幾次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

905. But when you get to know me, you know about me, I don't wait for anything.
→ {"text": "但當你了解我，知道我的為人，我不會等待任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

906. I don't wait till everything's perfect.
→ {"text": "我不會等到一切完美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

907. I just jump headfirst, fly by the seat of my pants.
→ {"text": "我就是一頭栽進去，憑感覺飛翔。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

908. So I immediately went to the YouTube waves.
→ {"text": "所以我立刻就投入 YouTube 的浪潮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

909. I want to share this.
→ {"text": "我想要分享這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

910. And my first channeling was actually a lot better.
→ {"text": "而我第一次的通靈其實好多了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

911. In the couple of times I had tried between then, I probably only did maybe 6 to 10 channelings between the first one and the one I put on YouTube.
→ {"text": "在那之間我嘗試的幾次裡，從第一次到我放上 YouTube 的那一次，我可能只做了大概 6 到 10 次通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

912. And when you describe 6 to 10 channelings, or six channelings or so before you-- and you're recording yourself, are you asking questions?
→ {"text": "當你描述 6 到 10 次通靈，或者說在你——錄製自己的時候，你在問問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

913. Is it just you in the room?
→ {"text": "房間裡只有你一個人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

914. I mean, how do you-- is there somebody else?
→ {"text": "我是說，你怎麼——有其他人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

915. Well, you said your wife-- is she there to help facilitate?
→ {"text": "嗯，你說你的妻子——她在那裡幫助引導嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

916. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

917. At that point, the first couple ones was just letting TReb talk.
→ {"text": "那時候，前幾次就是讓崔博說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

918. I told him, you just come through and say what you want to say.
→ {"text": "我告訴他，你就現身，說你想說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

919. I'll share something.
→ {"text": "我會分享一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

920. If it's usable, we can put it on YouTube.
→ {"text": "如果能用，我們就可以放到 YouTube 上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

921. So address people.
→ {"text": "所以對著人們說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

922. And that's the first couple of times.
→ {"text": "那就是前幾次的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

923. And then after that, my then wife would ask a few questions.
→ {"text": "然後在那之後，我當時的妻子會問幾個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

924. I let one of my friends try.
→ {"text": "我讓我的一個朋友試試。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

925. So it was basically trial and error, just playing around the first time.
→ {"text": "所以基本上就是反覆嘗試，第一次只是玩玩看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

926. So I guess the information was still good.
→ {"text": "所以我想資訊還是好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

927. It was just-- you say when it was horrible, it wasn't the information was horrible.
→ {"text": "只是——你說糟糕的時候，不是資訊糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

928. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

929. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

930. And some of the information came through a little odd, just the verbiage on it was weird.
→ {"text": "有些資訊傳來有點奇怪，就是用詞很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

931. You could tell it was like having someone who first learned how to speak English be able to talk.
→ {"text": "你可以看出來，就像是一個剛學會說英語的人在說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

932. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

933. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

934. Well, that's what I was wondering.
→ {"text": "嗯，那正是我想知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

935. And maybe this is a question for TReb later.
→ {"text": "也許這是一個稍後給崔博的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

936. Does he have to learn English?
→ {"text": "他需要學英語嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

937. Or is it all translated by you via vibrational translations, vibrational frequencies?
→ {"text": "還是都是你透過振動轉譯、振動頻率來翻譯的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

938. My best understanding is that, basically-- like when I go to channel, I'm using the same techniques in a quicker way than I used to when I would leave my physical body.
→ {"text": "據我所知，基本上——就像我去通靈的時候，我使用的是同樣的技巧，只是比我以前離開肉身時更快的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

939. So I'm leaving, and part of TReb comes in.
→ {"text": "所以我離開了，崔博的一部分進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

940. So when he's in, he's mixing his energy with mine.
→ {"text": "所以當他進來時，他在混合他的能量與我的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

941. So it's running through my chakra systems, but also accessing the brain part.
→ {"text": "所以它運行通過我的脈輪系統，但也存取大腦部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

942. And in that brain part is the whole English language, my experiences, all of my personality.
→ {"text": "而在那個大腦部分裡有整個英語語言、我的經驗、我的全部人格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

943. So he has the opportunity to access that.
→ {"text": "所以他有機會存取那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

944. So English, it wasn't that the English was bad, because he knew English by knowing my mind.
→ {"text": "所以英語，並不是英語不好，因為他透過了解我的心智而知道英語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

945. It was the way of trying to express it.
→ {"text": "而是試圖表達它的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

946. Like Aridif and TReb, still to this day, sometimes they might get hung up on a word, so they'll stop.
→ {"text": "像阿里迪夫和崔博，直到今天，有時候他們可能會卡在一個詞上，所以他們會停下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

947. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

948. And they'll search for the word or find one that's as compatible as they can.
→ {"text": "然後他們會搜尋這個詞，或者找一個盡可能相容的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

949. So sometimes when-- like the one that's most known, Aridif, when he says, you must do this, he's not saying, you have to do this.
→ {"text": "所以有時候——像是最為人所知的，阿里迪夫，當他說「你必須做這件事」，他不是在說「你不得不做這件事」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

950. He's saying, if you want what you're desiring, this is the best way.
→ {"text": "他是在說，如果你想要你渴望的東西，這是最好的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

951. Right
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

952. So little things like that.
→ {"text": "所以就是這樣的小事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

953. But then it was much more disproportional than it is now.
→ {"text": "但那時候比現在不協調得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

954. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

955. So it was more of a translation glitch--
→ {"text": "所以這更像是翻譯的小毛病——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

956. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 312

957. Than an actual understanding of the language or knowing the language.
→ {"text": "而不是實際理解語言或知道語言的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

958. It's not necessarily what's happening.
→ {"text": "不見得是那樣發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

959. It's not like he went and had to take a course in English 101.
→ {"text": "不是說他去修了英語 101 課程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

960. That would be rough.
→ {"text": "那會很艱難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

961. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

962. But yeah, absolutely.
→ {"text": "但對，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

963. It's a translational vibrational thing.
→ {"text": "這是一種翻譯的振動性的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

964. My vibration at the time, it wasn't what it is now.
→ {"text": "我當時的振動，不是現在這樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

965. I was learning all this cool stuff, but I hadn't applied very much of it.
→ {"text": "我在學習所有這些很酷的東西，但還沒有應用太多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

966. What I did learn and applied helped.
→ {"text": "我學到並應用的那些確實有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

967. And it was really six months--
→ {"text": "而且真的是六個月——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

968. In some way, you're translating too.
→ {"text": "在某種程度上，你也在翻譯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

969. You have to raise your level.
→ {"text": "你必須提升你的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

970. He has to bring his level down.
→ {"text": "他必須降低他的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

971. So there has to be this kind of-- and then there's a growth, I'm assuming, since then.
→ {"text": "所以必須有這樣的——然後我猜想，從那時起就有了成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

972. Like you said, it's gotten better.
→ {"text": "就像你說的，它變得更好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

973. So you're able to meet each other's frequencies.
→ {"text": "所以你們能夠遇見彼此的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

974. You're going up there, him coming down here.
→ {"text": "你往上走，他往下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

975. So that's evolved over the years.
→ {"text": "所以這些年來有了演變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 315

976. Yes, absolutely.
→ {"text": "對，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

977. That's the perfect way, too, to explain that.
→ {"text": "那也是解釋這個的完美方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

978. It's something where it's amalgamation of two consciousnesses.
→ {"text": "這是兩個意識的融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

979. And it's a concerted effort on both of our parts to co-create that.
→ {"text": "這是我們雙方共同努力去共同創造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

980. And I couldn't get up to him.
→ {"text": "而我無法上升到他那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

981. He could always come down to me, but I just couldn't get up to him.
→ {"text": "他總是可以下降到我這裡，但我就是無法上升到他那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

982. And the more I channeled, the more I felt his energy.
→ {"text": "我通靈越多，就越能感受到他的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

983. And the more I felt his energy, the easier it was for me to integrate certain parts of the teachings.
→ {"text": "而我越能感受到他的能量，我就越容易整合教導的某些部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

984. And in the teachings, a lot of the stuff about self-creation, relaxing, the way to perceive reality started clicking easier.
→ {"text": "而在教導中，很多關於自我創造、放鬆、感知實相的方式開始更容易理解了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

985. So after the first six months of channeling, I was 10 times better than the first one.
→ {"text": "所以在通靈的頭六個月之後，我比第一次好了 10 倍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

986. And in the first year of channeling, I was 10 times better than that.
→ {"text": "而在通靈的第一年裡，我又比那好了 10 倍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

987. And it kept going.
→ {"text": "而且還在持續進步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

988. And it's like any job that any person does with their motor skills.
→ {"text": "這就像任何人用他們的運動技能做任何工作一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

989. Muscle memory comes into play.
→ {"text": "肌肉記憶發揮作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

990. Well, this is energetic muscle memory.
→ {"text": "嗯，這是能量肌肉記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

991. And that's how it's applied.
→ {"text": "這就是它的應用方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

992. It's the more you do and repeat, the better you are at it.
→ {"text": "你做得越多、重複得越多，你就越擅長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

993. And that's why even to this day, I get better at channeling.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼即使到了今天，我的通靈還在變得更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

994. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

995. This time last year, channeling was great.
→ {"text": "去年這個時候，通靈就很棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

996. It was smooth.
→ {"text": "很流暢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

997. People resonated with it, but now it's a whole new level.
→ {"text": "人們與它共鳴，但現在是全新的層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

998. And this is why you see the veterans out there who've channeled their entire life; Darryl Anka, and Nora, and Wendy.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼你看到那些資深通靈者，他們一生都在通靈；Darryl Anka、Nora 和 Wendy。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

999. All those great channelers, they've been doing that forever.
→ {"text": "所有那些偉大的通靈者，他們已經做了很久很久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1000. It's their connection.
→ {"text": "這是他們的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1001. TReb and Aridif actually have a term for it.
→ {"text": "崔博和阿里迪夫其實有一個術語來稱呼它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1002. It's called building a bridge.
→ {"text": "叫做建立橋樑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1003. And each time you channel, you're putting a new peg in, or a new screw, or a new plate of metal.
→ {"text": "每次你通靈，你都在放入一個新的樁、一個新的螺絲，或一塊新的金屬板。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1004. And the bigger the piece comes, it's the bigger realizations you have in yourself.
