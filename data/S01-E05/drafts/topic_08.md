## Speaker Group 194

643. And from there, it just kept going.
→ {"text": "從那之後就一路持續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. Now, most people who have heard TReb or Aridif on the radio or on YouTube, they might not know the whole story about it.
→ {"text": "現在，大多數在廣播或 YouTube 上聽過崔博或阿里迪夫的人，可能不知道完整的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. I worked with TReb for two years in meditative state before I ever channeled.
→ {"text": "在我開始通靈之前，我在冥想狀態中與崔博合作了兩年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. I really had no interest to channel.
→ {"text": "我真的沒有興趣通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. At the end of the two years, I felt like I had learned all I could learn.
→ {"text": "在兩年結束時，我覺得我已經學完了所有能學的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. Of course, being the human ego, I was like, I know everything now.
→ {"text": "當然，作為人類的小我，我心想，我現在什麼都知道了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

649. I know the universe.
→ {"text": "我了解宇宙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

650. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

651. It's like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix.
→ {"text": "就像《駭客任務》裡的基努·李維。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. He's like, I know Kung Fu.
→ {"text": "他說，我會功夫了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

653. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. Instantly.
→ {"text": "瞬間就會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. Yeah, that was beautiful.
→ {"text": "對，那很精彩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

656. But so after two years, though, you're like, yeah.
→ {"text": "但所以兩年之後，你就覺得，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

657. I know what I can know.
→ {"text": "我知道我能知道的了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. And I wanted to find out how to teach it to people.
→ {"text": "而我想找出如何把這些教給別人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

659. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

660. I thought I was ready to teach people, and I was.
→ {"text": "我認為我準備好教人了，而我確實準備好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. So I knew that it was possible to channel.
→ {"text": "所以我知道通靈是可能的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. I'd seen Jane Roberts do it.
→ {"text": "我看過珍·羅伯茲做過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. And by that point, I had looked up Darryl Anka.
→ {"text": "而到那時，我已經查過達瑞爾·安卡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. I had heard of Kryon, even though I never checked out a lot of that work at that point.
→ {"text": "我聽說過克里昂，雖然當時我沒有深入了解那些作品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. And I'd seen just a very few others.
→ {"text": "而我只看過非常少數的其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. Back when I started doing this--
→ {"text": "當我開始做這件事時——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

667. Esther Hicks and Abraham Hicks.
→ {"text": "伊絲特·希克斯和亞伯拉罕希克斯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

668. I'd never even heard of her until I met Kalina.
→ {"text": "直到我遇見卡莉娜之前，我甚至從未聽說過她。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. Kalina is the one who's like, have you ever heard of-- who?
→ {"text": "卡莉娜問我，你聽說過——誰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. And she's like you really are a channeler.
→ {"text": "然後她說，你真的是個通靈者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. Because so many channelers are so oblivious of other spiritual teachers, just because they're in their own groove.
→ {"text": "因為很多通靈者對其他靈性導師一無所知，只是因為他們專注於自己的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

672. I just did another interview.
→ {"text": "我剛做了另一個訪談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. And they-- she was saying the exact same thing.
→ {"text": "而她說的完全一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. I was like bringing up all these names.
→ {"text": "我提到所有這些名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. She was like, ah, I don't know.
→ {"text": "她說，啊，我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. The name sounds familiar, but purposely, I don't go and see that stuff, because I don't want to plagiarize or say anything that-- I don't want anybody to think that I'm copying their material.
→ {"text": "這個名字聽起來很熟，但我刻意不去看那些東西，因為我不想抄襲或說任何——我不希望任何人認為我在複製他們的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

677. Well, that was a concern of mine, too.
→ {"text": "嗯，那也是我的顧慮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. When I started to jump ahead a little, when I started channeling, I cut myself off from all other channel material.
→ {"text": "當我跳到後面一點，當我開始通靈時，我切斷了與所有其他通靈材料的聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

679. I said, I want-- and this was for me, not for anyone else-- I want to know what's coming through is legitimate.
→ {"text": "我說，我想要——這是為了我自己，不是為了別人——我想知道通過我傳遞的東西是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

680. I had huge filter issues in the beginning.
→ {"text": "我一開始有嚴重的過濾問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. But to jump back, I work with TReb.
→ {"text": "但回到之前，我與崔博合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. I told him, I want to channel.
→ {"text": "我告訴他，我想通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. I want to share this.
→ {"text": "我想分享這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

684. But I want you to be there for the answers, because there's still stuff I'm probably not sure of.
→ {"text": "但我希望你在那裡提供答案，因為還有些東西我可能不確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. And if there is, you need to be there.
→ {"text": "如果有的話，你需要在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

686. The channeling idea was cool to me, and we worked with it.
→ {"text": "通靈的想法對我來說很酷，我們就這麼做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

687. So when you said you want-- you asked him to be there, but in essence, channeling, you're asking him to come through.
→ {"text": "所以當你說你想要——你要求他在那裡，但本質上，通靈就是你要求他降臨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

688. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

689. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

690. You had that conversation with him in this meditative state, which again, I'm assuming is still as visceral as ever.
→ {"text": "你在這個冥想狀態中與他對話，我猜這仍然像往常一樣真實生動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

691. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

692. It's still like--
→ {"text": "仍然像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

693. Never a time was dull.
→ {"text": "從來沒有沉悶的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

694. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. So it all felt just like we're having a conversation just now.
→ {"text": "所以一切感覺就像我們現在正在對話一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. Only you're on a ship always, or--
→ {"text": "只是你總是在飛船上，還是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

697. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

698. We were everywhere at that point.
→ {"text": "當時我們到處都去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. The first time was a ship.
→ {"text": "第一次是在飛船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. And after that, most, like I'd say probably 75% or more of the time, I'm with him on his planet, just different parts of the planet.
→ {"text": "在那之後，大部分時間，我會說大概 75% 或更多的時候，我和他在他的星球上，只是在星球的不同地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. But yeah, I've been everywhere with him.
→ {"text": "但對，我和他去過各種地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

702. Well, I know I don't want to get out of order here, but what's his planet like?
→ {"text": "嗯，我知道我不想打亂順序，但他的星球是什麼樣子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

703. What is that like?
→ {"text": "那是什麼樣子的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

704. Oh, it's beautiful.
→ {"text": "哦，非常美麗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. It's gorgeous.
→ {"text": "超級漂亮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

706. When you're looking up at the sky, it's a beautiful, beautiful purple sky.
→ {"text": "當你抬頭看天空時，那是美麗、美麗的紫色天空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

707. Purple sky?
→ {"text": "紫色天空？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

708. It's hard to explain, too, because the shade of purple it is, there really isn't a shade of purple I found to show people, like this is the purple.
→ {"text": "也很難解釋，因為那個紫色的色調，我真的沒找到可以展示給人們看的紫色，就像這就是那個紫色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. But they have tons of red plants.
→ {"text": "但他們有大量的紅色植物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

710. Red plants?
→ {"text": "紅色植物？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

711. Very beautiful green water.
→ {"text": "非常美麗的綠色水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

712. It's gorgeous.
→ {"text": "超級美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

713. Green water?
→ {"text": "綠色的水？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

714. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

715. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

716. So we're talking.
→ {"text": "所以我們在說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

717. Are all the plants red?
→ {"text": "所有植物都是紅色的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

718. Do they have green plants?
→ {"text": "他們有綠色植物嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

719. Oh, no, no.
→ {"text": "哦，不，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

720. It's all red, just different shades of red.
→ {"text": "全都是紅色，只是不同深淺的紅色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

721. There are a couple ones that are different, like so different in red, they're almost not red, like yellows.
→ {"text": "有幾種是不同的，紅得很不一樣，幾乎不是紅色，像是黃色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

722. And a couple of them are purple, but not-- it's like a red-purple.
→ {"text": "還有幾種是紫色，但不是——那是種紅紫色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

723. It's all shaded red.
→ {"text": "全都是紅色調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

724. And I don't know if that has to do with their star, or if it has to do with the actual plants the way I can perceive it.
→ {"text": "我不知道這是否與他們的恆星有關，還是與我能感知到的實際植物有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

725. What about their dirt and the ground?
→ {"text": "那他們的泥土和地面呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

726. What is that like?
→ {"text": "那是什麼樣子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

727. I've never seen it.
→ {"text": "我從未見過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

728. It's all covered with stuff.
→ {"text": "全都被東西覆蓋著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

729. It's covered with red leaves.
→ {"text": "被紅葉覆蓋著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

730. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

731. Well, just like grass.
→ {"text": "嗯，就像草一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

732. There's a different kind of grass.
→ {"text": "有一種不同的草。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

733. It's more fluffy.
→ {"text": "更蓬鬆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

734. It's like--
→ {"text": "它像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

735. Moss?
→ {"text": "苔蘚？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

736. Not like moss, more-- it's-- I can't think of the plant's name.
→ {"text": "不像苔蘚，更——它是——我想不起那種植物的名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

737. It's stuff that people eat.
→ {"text": "是人們吃的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

738. It's like a mix of kale and a dandelion, I think.
→ {"text": "我想它像是羽衣甘藍和蒲公英的混合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

739. It's hard to explain.
→ {"text": "很難解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

740. Kale and a dandelion.
→ {"text": "羽衣甘藍和蒲公英。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

741. It's fluffy, and it's leafy.
→ {"text": "它是蓬鬆的，而且是葉狀的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

742. Not wheatgrass.
→ {"text": "不是麥草。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

743. It might be.
→ {"text": "可能是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

744. I'm not versed on the--
→ {"text": "我對這些不熟——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

745. On the whole health food stuff.
→ {"text": "對整個健康食品的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

746. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

747. Not yet.
→ {"text": "還沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

748. I'm working on that.
→ {"text": "我正在努力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

749. All right.
→ {"text": "好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

750. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

751. But it's all over the ground.
→ {"text": "但它覆蓋整個地面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

752. So you don't see exposed ground.
→ {"text": "所以你看不到裸露的地面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

753. And I never went digging.
→ {"text": "而我從未去挖過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

754. Every time I'm there--
→ {"text": "每次我在那裡——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

755. Sprouts.
→ {"text": "豆芽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

756. Yeah, sprouts.
→ {"text": "對，豆芽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

757. That's a good one.
→ {"text": "那個說得好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

758. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

759. I like that.
→ {"text": "我喜歡那個比喻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

760. It's kind of like that.
→ {"text": "有點像那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

761. Yeah, but leafy, a little leafier.
→ {"text": "對，但更葉狀，更多葉子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

762. All right. OK.
→ {"text": "好吧。好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

763. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

764. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

765. It's fascinating, because I've never heard like this, like you were in that world, so visceral, and so real.
→ {"text": "這太迷人了，因為我從未聽過這樣的，像你真的在那個世界裡，如此生動、如此真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

766. I didn't understand that's-- I think before we were joking at the seminar you went fishing with TReb.
→ {"text": "我不明白那是——我想之前我們在研討會上開玩笑說你和崔博去釣魚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

767. But I'd never thought it was actually going fishing, like we're here at a lake.
→ {"text": "但我從未想過那真的是去釣魚，就像我們在這裡的湖邊一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

768. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

769. It's that real that you could go--
→ {"text": "就是那麼真實，你可以去——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

770. That real.
→ {"text": "那麼真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

771. I wonder what kind of fish?
→ {"text": "我好奇是什麼樣的魚？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

772. Did you ever see any fish?
→ {"text": "你有看過任何魚嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

773. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

774. They do have underwater life there.
→ {"text": "他們那裡確實有水下生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

775. They have big, big lizards too.
→ {"text": "他們也有很大、很大的蜥蜴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

776. Go figure.
→ {"text": "你猜怎麼著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

777. There are these gigantic-- I'd say probably about six-foot long.
→ {"text": "有這些巨大的——我會說大概六呎長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

778. Like iguanas?
→ {"text": "像鬣蜥嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

779. They're more-- they're actually very similar, TReb said, to their third den-- or the second density, their second density life, which is, they kind of look like Komodo dragons, but more upright.
→ {"text": "他們更——崔博說實際上非常相似，他們的第三層——或者第二密度，他們的第二密度生命，也就是，他們看起來有點像科莫多巨蜥，但更直立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

780. They're really long, really big, very thick scaling.
→ {"text": "他們真的很長、很大，有非常厚的鱗片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

781. They have the same color skin as TReb's race, different shades darker though.
→ {"text": "他們的皮膚顏色和崔博的種族一樣，只是色調更深一些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

782. More towards like a forest green-blue, if that makes sense.
→ {"text": "更偏向森林綠藍色，如果這樣說有意義的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

783. And you've seen these?
→ {"text": "你見過這些嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

784. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

785. I've seen those.
→ {"text": "我見過那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

786. Those are-- the major life on their planet are those.
→ {"text": "那些是——他們星球上的主要生命就是那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
