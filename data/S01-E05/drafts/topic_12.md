## Speaker Group 391

1315. And the overall message-- so they're obviously type 1 ETs.
→ {"text": "而整體訊息——所以他們顯然是第一類型外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1316. And their overall message, if you could sum it up
→ {"text": "如果你能總結他們的整體訊息", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 392

1317. If I could sum it up in one sentence, it's you create everything.
→ {"text": "如果我要用一句話總結，那就是「你創造一切」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1318. And If I could sum it up in a small paragraph, we create that physical reality around us, and every aspect of it.
→ {"text": "如果我要用一小段話來總結，我們創造了周遭的物質實相，以及它的每一個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1319. And when we do, we bring the reflections of what's inside of ourselves to be outside of ourselves and to co-create.
→ {"text": "當我們這麼做時，我們把內在的映照帶到外在，並共同創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1320. So a lot of people look at it.
→ {"text": "所以很多人看待這件事時會想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1321. Well, how is Reuben a projection of Rob?
→ {"text": "嗯，魯本怎麼會是羅伯的投射？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1322. Well, it has to be.
→ {"text": "嗯，必然如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1323. There's you there, and there's me there.
→ {"text": "那裡有你，那裡也有我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1324. But I'm bringing you into my reality for a reason, as you are me.
→ {"text": "但我把你帶入我的實相是有原因的，因為你就是我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1325. We're co-creating a reflection.
→ {"text": "我們在共同創造一個映照。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1326. And literally, you're a version that I projected into my universe.
→ {"text": "而且從字面意義上來說，你是我投射到我宇宙中的一個版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1327. But it's very literal in those terms.
→ {"text": "在這些意義上，這是非常字面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1328. And people don't look at it in that way.
→ {"text": "而人們不會這樣看待它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1329. They're like, figuratively, you create.
→ {"text": "他們會說，比喻性地，你創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1330. No, literally.
→ {"text": "不，是字面上的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1331. And figuratively.
→ {"text": "也是比喻性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 393

1332. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 394

1333. That's the message.
→ {"text": "這就是訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1334. And they explore all parts of it.
→ {"text": "他們探索它的所有部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1335. They give answers for extraterrestrial things.
→ {"text": "他們提供關於外星事物的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1336. What's going on in our galaxy?
→ {"text": "我們銀河系正在發生什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1337. I've always termed it universal, or galactic knowledge, universal knowledge, what's going on out there.
→ {"text": "我一直稱之為宇宙知識，或銀河知識，宇宙知識，外面正在發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1338. And that's an important part.
→ {"text": "這是很重要的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1339. The other entities, too, that I've channeled, Nihal, Metatron.
→ {"text": "我通靈的其他實體，像是尼哈爾、梅塔特隆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1340. Metatron would say that the universal and galactic knowledge is not so important.
→ {"text": "梅塔特隆會說，宇宙和銀河知識並不那麼重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1341. What's important is you growing into who you are.
→ {"text": "重要的是你成長為你自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1342. So sometimes he talks about humans distract themselves with what's going on out there when they can't figure out what's going on down here.
→ {"text": "所以有時他會說，人類在無法弄清楚這裡發生什麼時，就用外面發生的事情來分散自己的注意力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 395

1343. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 396

1344. A different point of view, and I respect that.
→ {"text": "這是不同的觀點，我尊重這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1345. And I understand.
→ {"text": "我也理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1346. But TReb and Aridif bring us a perspective that's universal.
→ {"text": "但崔博和阿里迪夫帶給我們一個宇宙性的視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1347. And it gives us our opportunity to say how humans fit in this universal complex, which is something that a lot of people have strived to know their whole lives.
→ {"text": "這給了我們機會去理解人類如何融入這個宇宙複合體，這是很多人窮盡一生都想知道的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1348. And it's very easy to see the human race as a part of it, but not how each individual is a part of first the Earth collective, then the universalness.
→ {"text": "很容易看到人類種族是其中的一部分，但卻不容易發現每個個體，先是地球集體的一部分，然後才是宇宙整體的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1349. It's amazing.
→ {"text": "這很驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1350. It's something that Aridif sums up very well.
→ {"text": "這是阿里迪夫總結得非常好的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 397

1351. And just you mentioned the Nihal.
→ {"text": "你剛才提到了尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 398

1352. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 399

1353. Is that a collective consciousness?
→ {"text": "那是一個集體意識嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 400

1354. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1355. That is a collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "那是一個集體意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1356. Now, the Nihal, a very interesting story.
→ {"text": "現在，關於尼哈爾，這是個非常有趣的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1357. I'll give you a bit about them.
→ {"text": "我稍微跟你說說他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1358. The Nihal are future humans.
→ {"text": "尼哈爾是未來的人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1359. They exist as one of our timelines in the future.
→ {"text": "他們存在於我們未來的其中一條時間線中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1360. So it's a probable reality where we leave Earth.
→ {"text": "所以這是一個可能的實相，我們離開了地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1361. Well, not all of us, but a chunk of us leave Earth and become the Nihal.
→ {"text": "嗯，不是全部的人，而是我們的一部分人離開地球，成為尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1362. And we evolve into very short beings, about-- I can't remember-- three to four foot, somewhere in there.
→ {"text": "我們演化成非常矮小的存有，大約——我記不太清楚——三到四英尺，大概那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1363. Orange-ish skin, highly psychic.
→ {"text": "橘色的皮膚，高度通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1364. And we evolve into that.
→ {"text": "我們演化成那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1365. Now, the fun part, the part where it ties back in, the Nihal are the race who seeded TReb's race.
→ {"text": "現在，有趣的部分，也是連結回來的部分，尼哈爾就是播種了崔博族群的種族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1366. So TReb's race was a byproduct, or a direct product, of engineering DNA from a human being DNA and from a second density lizard being who lived in, I believe, the Capellan region, which is where TReb comes from.
→ {"text": "所以崔博的族群是副產品，或者說是直接產物，是從人類 DNA 和第二密度蜥蜴生命的基因工程而來，那些蜥蜴生命住在，我相信，五車二星域，也就是崔博的來源地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 401

1367. Human or Nihal DNA, but Nihal being human.
→ {"text": "人類還是尼哈爾的 DNA，但尼哈爾本身就是人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 402

1368. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1369. Nihal.
→ {"text": "尼哈爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1370. But it is different than human DNA.
→ {"text": "但它確實與人類 DNA 不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1371. And that's a good point you bring up. also occurs when one race leaves their home planet and goes to another.
→ {"text": "你提出了一個好問題。當一個種族離開他們的母星球前往另一個星球時，也會發生這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1372. The planet itself is a being.
→ {"text": "星球本身就是一個存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1373. It's a seventh density collective being.
→ {"text": "它是第七密度的集體存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 403

1374. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 404

1375. And then this race that comes is also a collective of the seventh density with all the oversouls at the lower seventh density.
→ {"text": "然後來到的這個種族也是第七密度的集體，所有超靈都處於較低的第七密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1376. And then they meet.
→ {"text": "然後他們相遇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1377. They co-create a brand new energy.
→ {"text": "他們共同創造出一種全新的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1378. So both collectives merge into one, and the DNA changes.
→ {"text": "所以兩個集體融合為一，DNA 就改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1379. And that's why when the human race leaves the other planets, they change their physical appearance, because their DNA changes.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼當人類種族離開地球前往其他星球時，他們的物質外觀會改變，因為他們的 DNA 改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1380. Their physical body adapts to the new merging of the collective planet consciousness and their race's consciousness.
→ {"text": "他們的物質身體適應了行星集體意識與他們種族意識的新融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1381. So that's a part of it too.
→ {"text": "所以這也是其中一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1382. Now, when we're getting into the Nihal, the reason for doing TReb's race, a lot of people are like, well, if we're evolved, why would we be messing with DNA?
→ {"text": "現在，當我們談到尼哈爾，創造崔博族群的原因時，很多人會說，如果我們已經進化了，為什麼還要搞 DNA 工程？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1383. We've had that done to us.
→ {"text": "我們曾經被這樣對待過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1384. It's not very nice.
→ {"text": "這不太好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1385. There's such a stigma around negative reptilian energy.
→ {"text": "圍繞負面爬蟲人能量有著如此深的污名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1386. And it was hinted, not ever directly said, yes, this is the 100% reason.
→ {"text": "這被暗示過，但從未直接說過，是的，這就是百分之百的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1387. But TReb, Aridif, but more so than that, another entity who I channeled in the book about TReb's race, one of their-- I think it was the military, ex-military.
→ {"text": "但崔博、阿里迪夫，但更甚於此的是，我在關於崔博族群的書中通靈的另一個實體，他們其中一位——我想是軍方的，前軍方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 405

1388. The woman?
→ {"text": "那位女性？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 406

1389. Yes, the woman.
→ {"text": "對，那位女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1390. She said that the reason that they did that was so that they could show the entire galaxy that not all reptilians are bad.
→ {"text": "她說，他們這麼做的原因，是為了向整個銀河系證明，不是所有爬蟲人都是壞的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1391. The stigma of Earth, especially Earth, was that reptilians are negative.
→ {"text": "地球的污名，尤其是地球，就是爬蟲人是負面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1392. They will eat your children.
→ {"text": "他們會吃掉你的孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1393. They'll drug you.
→ {"text": "他們會給你下藥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1394. They'll throw you in a cave, and put you in their pie.
→ {"text": "他們會把你扔進洞穴，把你放進他們的派裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 407

1395. What is it the-- David Icke, the queen, and all of our government officials evolved.
→ {"text": "那是什麼——大衛·艾克說的，女王和我們所有的政府官員都是進化的爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1396. Evil reptilians taking over the planet.
→ {"text": "邪惡的爬蟲人接管地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 408

1397. And I get it.
→ {"text": "我理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 409

1398. That could-- that's probably true.
→ {"text": "那可能——那可能是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 410

1399. But not every reptilian has that.
→ {"text": "但不是每個爬蟲人都是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 411

1400. Yeah, exactly.
→ {"text": "對，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 412

1401. And TReb-- this is something I commend TReb for.
→ {"text": "而崔博——這是我讚揚崔博的一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1402. He is one of the very few channels who have come out and said, listen, the evil reptilians are there.
→ {"text": "他是極少數站出來說，聽著，邪惡的爬蟲人確實存在的通靈管道之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1403. This is what they've done to you.
→ {"text": "這是他們對你做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1404. This is how they're still doing things to you.
→ {"text": "這是他們仍在對你做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1405. But you're focusing on it, and it's going to keep going on.
→ {"text": "但你專注於此，它就會持續下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1406. When you pull your focus from it and start focusing on the power you have, then it doesn't-- then even if they're standing next to you slapping people with whips, they can't touch you.
→ {"text": "當你把注意力從這上面移開，開始專注於你擁有的力量時，那麼它就不會——那麼即使他們站在你旁邊用鞭子抽打人們，他們也無法碰觸你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 413

1407. Just like Jesus and the cross.
→ {"text": "就像耶穌和十字架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1408. It was much-- the story's go as much they were whipping him and torturing him, he didn't feel a thing.
→ {"text": "故事說，他們鞭打他、折磨他，但他什麼都感覺不到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 414

1409. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1410. And that's the beauty part of it.
→ {"text": "這就是美妙的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1411. That's something that TReb brings to us.
→ {"text": "這是崔博帶給我們的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1412. And the Nihal wanted to show us that.
→ {"text": "而尼哈爾想要向我們展示這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1413. They wanted to show us-- I think it was targeted for humans, but around the galaxy, there's still a stigma that most reptilians are neg-- even if they've interacted with a good reptilian.
→ {"text": "他們想要向我們展示——我認為這是針對人類的，但在整個銀河系中，仍然有一種污名，認為大多數爬蟲人都是負面的——即使他們曾與好的爬蟲人互動過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1414. Humanoids, I think, because of the damage they've had through slavery, the Anunnaki was half-reptilian, the ancient reptilians, the Earth reptilians.
→ {"text": "類人族群，我認為，因為他們經歷過奴役的傷害，阿努納奇是半爬蟲人，古代爬蟲人，地球爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1415. Those are all bad stories for humans.
→ {"text": "這些對人類來說都是糟糕的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1416. And that's kind of built in our DNA to fear them.
→ {"text": "這某種程度上是被建構在我們 DNA 裡的，讓我們害怕他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1417. And people, like David Icke, who've research just that part of it and shared it, it scares the crap out of people.
→ {"text": "而像大衛·艾克這樣的人，他們只研究了那一部分並分享出來，這把人們嚇得要死。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 415

1418. It continues to feed into that.
→ {"text": "這持續強化那種恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1419. Well, over the next couple of days, let's get into some channeling.
→ {"text": "那麼，在接下來的幾天裡，讓我們來做一些通靈吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1420. And I'd love to talk to TReb and Aridif and explore their world some more.
→ {"text": "我很想和崔博、阿里迪夫交談，更多地探索他們的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1421. Thanks for sharing your adventures.
→ {"text": "謝謝你分享你的冒險經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 416

1422. You're absolutely welcome.
→ {"text": "非常歡迎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 417

1423. And we'll see some more of you.
→ {"text": "我們會再見到你更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 418

1424. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 419

1425. Thanks, Rob.
→ {"text": "謝謝，羅伯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
