## Speaker Group 1

566. According to Bashar, in four years a great many people on Earth will come to understand that the dream dimension is the reality.
→ {"text": "根據巴夏所說，在四年內，地球上會有非常多人理解到夢境維度才是真正的實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

567. When I heard that, I thought getting there in just four years means the acceleration must be amazing.
→ {"text": "我聽到這個的時候，心想只要四年就能到達那裡，意味著加速的幅度一定很驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. Right now I'm in that dream dimension. It IS my reality.
→ {"text": "現在我就在那個夢境維度裡。那就是我的實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. I wake up in the morning still in that dimension.
→ {"text": "我早上醒來時，仍然在那個維度中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. Therefore I'm always in the state of being able to do whatever I want.
→ {"text": "因此我一直處在能做任何想做的事情的狀態中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. I want to tell people about it. This is the real way of life.
→ {"text": "我想告訴大家這件事。這才是真正的生活方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. As you connect to your true self and return to that higher consciousness, you'll remember that you can do anything.
→ {"text": "當你連結到真實的自己，回歸那更高的意識，你會記起自己可以做任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. With that awareness you're moving through parallel worlds.
→ {"text": "帶著那樣的覺知，你正在平行世界之間移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. You can shift your reality freely. -It's like a game. -It sure is.
→ {"text": "你可以自由轉換你的實相。—就像玩遊戲一樣。—確實是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. When you understand the function and how to control it, it's just a game.
→ {"text": "當你理解它的功能和如何控制它，這就只是一場遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. You can shift to the planet that reflects your state of consciousness and experience it.
→ {"text": "你可以轉換到反映你意識狀態的星球，並體驗它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. With open eyes, living in a dream. That's the era we are headed towards.
→ {"text": "睜著眼睛，活在夢中。那就是我們正在前往的時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. Everyone has forgotten that they're playing a game.
→ {"text": "每個人都忘記了自己在玩遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. We're playing a game of being asleep.
→ {"text": "我們正在玩一場沉睡的遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. We've gotten so involved into that game.
→ {"text": "我們已經太投入那場遊戲了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. But we're on the verge of realizing it's all a game so we can control it.
→ {"text": "但我們即將意識到這全是一場遊戲，所以我們可以控制它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. You can choose your favorable frequency.
→ {"text": "你可以選擇你喜歡的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. Gradually, as we connect to ourselves, we can zoom out and see the big picture.
→ {"text": "逐漸地，當我們連結到自己，我們可以拉遠視角，看見全貌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. Like the breadcrumbs we talked about earlier.
→ {"text": "就像我們先前談到的麵包屑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. If you look at a maze from above you can see the exit.
→ {"text": "如果你從上方看一個迷宮，你就能看到出口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. So you can guide yourself. It's the same idea.
→ {"text": "所以你可以引導自己。概念是一樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. When you see things from higher perspective you can guide yourself who is in this physical reality.
→ {"text": "當你從更高的角度看事情，你就能引導在這物質實相中的自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. Like, "Don't go that way. Go left."
→ {"text": "就像「別走那條路。往左走。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. Your Higher Self can call out to you.
→ {"text": "你的高我可以向你呼喚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. The other day in a class, the Galactic Council joined us.
→ {"text": "前幾天在課堂上，銀河議會加入了我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. Bashar works with them. -The Council is a... -The Association of Worlds?
→ {"text": "巴夏和他們一起工作。—議會是一個⋯⋯—世界聯盟嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. It's a collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "那是一個集體意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. How should I put it?
→ {"text": "該怎麼說呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. They're close to us.
→ {"text": "他們離我們很近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. We can become one body and do many things together.
→ {"text": "我們可以成為一體，一起做很多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. We can give guidance to the people who are asleep on Earth.
→ {"text": "我們可以給地球上沉睡的人們指引。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. The more I connect to myself, the more I can see what I can do too.
→ {"text": "我越是連結到自己，就越能看到我也能做些什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

598. So it's fun to work with them.
→ {"text": "所以和他們一起工作很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. This conversation made me remember that class.
→ {"text": "這段對話讓我想起了那堂課。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. Gradually this non-physical collective will participate more and more.
→ {"text": "逐漸地，這個非物質的集體會越來越多地參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. There's a reason why many UFOs are seen but not landing on Earth.
→ {"text": "為什麼許多不明飛行物被看見但不降落在地球上，是有原因的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. Deep sleep creates separation.
→ {"text": "深度沉睡創造出分離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. We're quick to fight because we use fear.
→ {"text": "我們很快就會開打，因為我們運用恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. If UFOs land and we start fighting, they'll have no choice but to fight back.
→ {"text": "如果不明飛行物降落，而我們開始戰鬥，他們將別無選擇，只能反擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. They don't want to scare us, that's why they contact from afar.
→ {"text": "他們不想嚇到我們，所以從遠處接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. But gradually we're raising our frequencies.
→ {"text": "但我們正逐漸提升我們的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. Now finally, we can see the possibility of joining the Council in ten years.
→ {"text": "現在終於，我們可以看到十年內加入議會的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. And the young ones will have been prepared for it.
→ {"text": "年輕的一代將已經為此做好準備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

609. So the ETs are waiting for us to prepare.
→ {"text": "所以外星人在等待我們準備好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. Yes, there's nothing they can do but wait.
→ {"text": "是的，他們除了等待別無他法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. We're trying our best, but really, we have to wait too.
→ {"text": "我們正盡力而為，但說真的，我們也必須等待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

612. For the people on Earth to gain elevated awareness.
→ {"text": "等待地球上的人們獲得更高的覺知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

613. But things have really sped up.
→ {"text": "但事情真的加速了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. If things keep accelerating, by next year the subject of UFO will be open.
→ {"text": "如果持續加速，到明年不明飛行物的話題就會公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. In general, when I talk to people about it it's not strange to them.
→ {"text": "一般來說，當我跟人們談論這個，他們不會覺得奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. Yes, that's already happening.
→ {"text": "是的，那已經在發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. But once it's disclosed, the change accelerates.
→ {"text": "但一旦被揭露，改變就會加速。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. People suspect that aliens exist. They can accept that idea.
→ {"text": "人們懷疑外星人存在。他們可以接受那個概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. Once they know that aliens do exist, they reject the idea because all they've learned is separation.
→ {"text": "一旦他們知道外星人確實存在，他們會拒絕這個想法，因為他們學到的全是分離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. Then everything you know collapses.
→ {"text": "然後你所知道的一切都崩塌了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. At the end, you'll shed yourself of separation to return to "One."
→ {"text": "最終，你會脫去分離，回歸「合一」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. It'll be a shock to know that aliens exist.
→ {"text": "知道外星人存在會是一場震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. But it's a good shock because you need to let go of stereotyped ideas.
→ {"text": "但這是好的震撼，因為你需要放下刻板的觀念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

624. Once this happens, things will change very fast.
→ {"text": "一旦這發生，事情會改變得非常快。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

625. It'll accelerate.
→ {"text": "會加速。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

626. Speaking of shock, when you first saw Bashar the shock was brief, wasn't it?
→ {"text": "說到震撼，你第一次看到巴夏時，震撼是很短暫的，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

627. How many days or months would it take to recover from the shock?
→ {"text": "從震撼中恢復需要多少天或多少個月？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. In my case?
→ {"text": "就我的情況來說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

629. When I went to the spacecraft and came back I had this resolute knowing within myself that I wasn't dreaming.
→ {"text": "當我去了太空船又回來，我內心有一種堅定的確知，我不是在做夢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. So there wasn't much of a shock.
→ {"text": "所以沒有太多的震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. I think it's the same with everyone.
→ {"text": "我想每個人都一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

632. It's for you to think "This is the truth."
→ {"text": "那是讓你去想「這就是真相」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

633. It's different from accepting other people's idea of truth.
→ {"text": "這和接受別人對真相的想法不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. Once you know your own truth, you'll stop doubting yourself.
→ {"text": "一旦你知道自己的真相，你就會停止懷疑自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. Then you'll start preparing to accept the truth.
→ {"text": "然後你會開始準備接受真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. Of course, you're the protagonist of your story.
→ {"text": "當然，你是你故事的主角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. You're the one to open the gate to let the information enter.
→ {"text": "你是那個打開大門讓資訊進入的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. Right now on this planet called Earth there will be more people who are ready to accept the idea that aliens exist.
→ {"text": "現在在這個叫地球的星球上，會有更多人準備好接受外星人存在的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. They'll become the majority.
→ {"text": "他們會成為大多數。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

640. From here on out, the changes will create some shock, the shock of the truth.
→ {"text": "從現在開始，這些改變會創造一些震撼，真相的震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

641. But it'll be different from the shock that I experienced before.
→ {"text": "但那會和我之前經歷的震撼不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

642. Somehow, I think the future will be extremely pleasant.
→ {"text": "不知為何，我認為未來會非常愉快。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

643. Children and awake people are emitting that signal.
→ {"text": "孩子們和覺醒的人們正在發出那樣的訊號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. So there's equilibrium.
→ {"text": "所以有一種平衡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. Without these people there will be just shock.
→ {"text": "沒有這些人，就只會有震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. Thanks to those who are stable and don't waver, the shock will just be temporary.
→ {"text": "多虧那些穩定且不動搖的人，震撼只會是暫時的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. Others will quickly learn from them that there's no need to be shocked.
→ {"text": "其他人會很快從他們身上學到不需要震驚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. But without those awakened people, things will be difficult.
→ {"text": "但沒有那些覺醒的人，事情會很困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

649. We are like an antenna, receiving signals.
→ {"text": "我們就像天線，接收訊號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. And we emit signals as well.
→ {"text": "我們也發出訊號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

651. So, do you think when the time for "disclosure" comes people won't be so shocked?
→ {"text": "所以，你認為當「外星揭露」的時刻來臨時，人們不會那麼震驚嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. For those in deep sleep, it will certainly come as a shock.
→ {"text": "對於那些深度沉睡的人，那肯定會是一場震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

653. The extent is different.
→ {"text": "程度不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. If you don't want to see the truth, you'll be hit the hardest.
→ {"text": "如果你不想看見真相，你會受到最大的衝擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. But if you're starting to awaken there will come a time where you need to choose.
→ {"text": "但如果你開始覺醒，會有一個時刻你需要做出選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. You may be swaying between being awake and staying asleep.
→ {"text": "你可能在清醒與沉睡之間搖擺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. For those who are swaying like that, this is a good shock.
→ {"text": "對那些這樣搖擺的人來說，這是好的震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. Now they have to choose. -So they choose. -Yes, that's what happens. -And there are those who stay... -Deeply asleep.
→ {"text": "現在他們必須選擇。—所以他們選擇。—是的，就是這樣。—還有那些保持⋯⋯—深度沉睡的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. For example, people who are into the stock market and such.
→ {"text": "例如，投入股票市場之類的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. The top brass, you mean.
→ {"text": "你是說高層。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. Like, people who make chemicals.
→ {"text": "比如，製造化學品的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. What you do for work is separate from this deep sleep.
→ {"text": "你的工作和這種深度沉睡是分開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. This is also a chance for those who are in deep sleep.
→ {"text": "這對那些深度沉睡的人來說也是一個機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. But disclosure may be a really big shock to them.
→ {"text": "但外星揭露對他們來說可能是一個非常大的震撼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. It might take a little time, but the awakened people will show them the way.
→ {"text": "可能需要一點時間，但覺醒的人會為他們指路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. A wave of them will come and show others the possibility of a bright future.
→ {"text": "會有一波這樣的人來臨，向其他人展示光明未來的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. So the sleepers will be afraid, but they'll gradually think all's well.
→ {"text": "所以沉睡的人會害怕，但他們會逐漸認為一切都好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. It's like when you're on an airplane and there's turbulence.
→ {"text": "就像當你在飛機上遇到亂流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. When it's really terrible, everyone's scared and looks at the flight attendants.
→ {"text": "當真的很可怕時，每個人都害怕，然後看向空服員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. When they see the flight attendants staying calm, they feel safe.
→ {"text": "當他們看到空服員保持冷靜，他們就感到安全。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. Just like that, when something out of control happens, people will look at the ones who know that this is the greatest thing ever.
→ {"text": "就像那樣，當失控的事情發生時，人們會看向那些知道這是有史以來最棒的事情的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. The signal those people send out is an invitation.
→ {"text": "那些人發出的訊號是一種邀請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. Not only that, our Galactic family are all supporting us.
→ {"text": "不僅如此，我們的銀河家族都在支持我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. There's stability.
→ {"text": "有一種穩定性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. We already have those awakened people and children.
→ {"text": "我們已經有那些覺醒的人和孩子們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. Earth is ready. That's why disclosure happens.
→ {"text": "地球已經準備好了。所以外星揭露會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

677. This is what I think.
→ {"text": "這是我的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. The sound of truth is different from the sound of knowledge.
→ {"text": "真理之聲和知識之聲不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

679. You can say things just from knowledge "The future will be good!"
→ {"text": "你可以只從知識來說「未來會很好！」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

680. "Don't worry! You can be free!"
→ {"text": "「別擔心！你可以自由！」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. But if you don't believe in it, it's not convincing.
→ {"text": "但如果你不相信它，就不具說服力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. When you have the knowing, "Our future is bright" has the sound of truth.
→ {"text": "當你有那個確知，「我們的未來是光明的」就有真理之聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. That creates stability.
→ {"text": "那創造出穩定性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

684. Returning to the conversation about excitement, in nature there's nothing but excitement.
→ {"text": "回到關於興奮的對話，在自然界中只有興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. There's no overthinking. A tree is as it is. -In the natural world, like forests? -Yes, and animals and such.
→ {"text": "沒有過度思考。一棵樹就是它本身。—在自然界，像森林？—是的，還有動物之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

686. Everyone seems to be excited all the time.
→ {"text": "每個人似乎一直都很興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. They create and take on various forms without thinking about it.
→ {"text": "他們創造並呈現各種形式，毫不思考。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

688. If it hits a barrier or a block it redirects itself.
→ {"text": "如果碰到障礙或阻礙，它會重新導向自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

689. In regard to trees and grass?
→ {"text": "關於樹木和草？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

690. Yes, similar to that.
→ {"text": "是的，類似那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

691. But this blooms through ideas.
→ {"text": "但這是透過想法綻放的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. It thinks "I'm a lily", therefore brings out the lilies from seeds.
→ {"text": "它想「我是百合」，因此從種子中長出百合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. Plants are not completely innocent nor without thought.
→ {"text": "植物不是完全無知或沒有思考的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

694. Plants learn ideas. There are lots of ideas in the soil.
→ {"text": "植物學習想法。土壤中有很多想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. Same around the Earth.
→ {"text": "地球周圍也一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. Just like cell phone signals, there are lots of ideas around us.
→ {"text": "就像手機訊號一樣，我們周圍有很多想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. Plants pick up those ideas.
→ {"text": "植物接收那些想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

698. One might pick up an idea of a tomato, producing three fruits from one seed.
→ {"text": "某顆種子可能接收到番茄的想法，從一顆種子長出三個果實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. That's how it works.
→ {"text": "就是這樣運作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. Plants don't just bloom without any ideas.
→ {"text": "植物不是在沒有任何想法的情況下綻放的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. This is an Earth-based plant.
→ {"text": "這是地球上的植物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

702. It learns ideas in the soil and takes that shape.
→ {"text": "它在土壤中學習想法，並呈現那個形狀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

703. When people of Earth return to the center the signals will change.
→ {"text": "當地球上的人們回歸中心，訊號就會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

704. Up until now, we've created limitations and rules from the idea of fear.
→ {"text": "直到現在，我們從恐懼的想法創造出限制和規則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. People have resonated in that idea and created this planet.
→ {"text": "人們在那個想法中共振，並創造出這個星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

706. But once people start to return to the center, that will create an incredibly harmonic sound.
→ {"text": "但一旦人們開始回歸中心，那會創造出令人難以置信的和諧之聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

707. When you know that you're perfect and you can be anything, you'll return to unconditional love.
→ {"text": "當你知道你是完美的，你可以成為任何事物，你就會回歸無條件的愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. When bringing about this awareness, our civilization will change.
→ {"text": "當帶來這種覺知，我們的文明會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. Also, the Earth's frequency will change.
→ {"text": "同時，地球的頻率也會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. The harsh ideas will become softer.
→ {"text": "嚴苛的想法會變得柔和。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

711. When the idea of "I can be anything" appears plants will pick up that idea and start taking different forms, I think. -That's our future. -I agree. Thank you.
→ {"text": "當「我可以成為任何事物」的想法出現，植物會接收那個想法，開始呈現不同的形式，我想。—那就是我們的未來。—我同意。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

712. Well, our interview became longer than expected.
