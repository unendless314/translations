## Speaker Group 1

409. Returning to my first topic, you and Darryl did some events together.
→ {"text": "回到我一開始的話題，你和達瑞爾曾經一起辦過活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. What was the process leading up to that point?
→ {"text": "在那之前經歷了什麼過程呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. It started in July of 1987, when Bashar first contacted me.
→ {"text": "那是從 1987 年 7 月開始的，當時巴夏第一次與我聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. For me this was the first time using telepathy.
→ {"text": "這是我第一次使用心電感應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. Bashar wanted me to channel him.
→ {"text": "巴夏想要我通靈他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. He said, "The people of Earth are awakening."
→ {"text": "他說：「地球人正在覺醒。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. "We went through a similar experience. We wish to support you."
→ {"text": "「我們也經歷過類似的經驗。我們希望支持你們。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. Bashar delivered this information to you directly?
→ {"text": "巴夏直接傳遞這些訊息給你嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. Yes, it was from him directly.
→ {"text": "對，直接來自他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. But I was still very much asleep at the time.
→ {"text": "但當時的我還非常沉睡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. I mean, channeling an extraterrestrial in public?
→ {"text": "我是說，在公眾面前通靈一個外星存有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. It was just unconceivable in our deeply asleep society at the time.
→ {"text": "在當時那個深度沉睡的社會裡，這根本是無法想像的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. But then Bashar said...
→ {"text": "但後來巴夏說......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. Well, at first, I was frightened by the whole ordeal, the idea of channeling him publicly.
→ {"text": "嗯，一開始，我對整件事感到恐懼，對公開通靈他這個想法感到害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. So I traveled to the US, where I spoke with Bashar through another channel.
→ {"text": "所以我前往美國，透過另一位通靈管道與巴夏對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. He said "Are you afraid you are going to fail?"
→ {"text": "他說：「你是害怕自己會失敗嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. I said, "That's exactly my fear."
→ {"text": "我說：「這正是我的恐懼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. Then he said "You have not failed in the past, nor will you ever fail."
→ {"text": "然後他說：「你過去不曾失敗，未來也永遠不會失敗。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. I didn't understand the meaning of it.
→ {"text": "我當時不明白這句話的意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. But I thought "There is no use trying to run away from this."
→ {"text": "但我想：「試圖逃避這件事是沒有用的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. I was starting to become aware of my true self, and I really didn't want to shut this out.
→ {"text": "我開始意識到真實的自己，而我真的不想將這個關上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. And it was then I was ready to lose everything.
→ {"text": "就在那時，我已經準備好失去一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. Even if I lost it all, it was okay.
→ {"text": "即使失去所有，也沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. Even though you risk losing friends, it still felt right?
→ {"text": "即使可能失去朋友，你仍然覺得這樣做是對的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. Yes, I knew people would take their distance.
→ {"text": "是的，我知道人們會保持距離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. But my conviction remained strong. I wanted to live my true self.
→ {"text": "但我的信念依然堅定。我想活出真實的自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. The part that had come to life.
→ {"text": "那個甦醒過來的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. The part who hadn't learnt limitations, my essence.
→ {"text": "那個未曾學習限制的部分，我的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. If that was indeed the "real me", then I really wanted to experience that freedom here on Earth.
→ {"text": "如果那確實是「真實的我」，那麼我真的想在地球上體驗那種自由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. This was the "truth" I kept returning to, no matter how much fear came.
→ {"text": "這就是我不斷回歸的「真相」，無論恐懼有多深。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. That's how I overcame that period.
→ {"text": "我就是這樣度過那段時期的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. From that point on I officially started to channel, appearing in public events in Japan.
→ {"text": "從那時起，我正式開始通靈，出現在日本的公開活動中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. Did that take time?
→ {"text": "那需要時間嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. To get familiar with channeling, did you have to take lessons with Bashar? -Was it easy? -No, I wouldn't call it easy.
→ {"text": "要熟悉通靈，你需要跟巴夏上課嗎？-容易嗎？-不，我不會說它容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. But when I decided to channel, knowing I could lose everything, I started speaking with Bashar telepathically.
→ {"text": "但當我決定通靈時，明知可能失去一切，我開始用心電感應與巴夏對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. "Yes" would come from up here, a "No" from below.
→ {"text": "「是」會從上方傳來，「不」則從下方傳來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. We created rules, things to make it easy for me.
→ {"text": "我們建立了規則，讓我能更容易進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there was that "preparation phase" where I was downloading information 24/7.
→ {"text": "還有，就像我之前提到的，有那個「準備階段」，我二十四小時不停地下載資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. The pipe cleaning.
→ {"text": "清理管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. It really was like cleaning, I think.
→ {"text": "我覺得那真的就像在清理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. When I was channeling Bashar, I would put all that Earthly knowledge aside.
→ {"text": "當我通靈巴夏時，我會把所有地球知識都放在一邊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. I would put aside all the laws and rules I had learnt on Earth, so as to become a transparent, clear pipe.
→ {"text": "我會放下所有在地球上學到的法則和規則，成為一個透明、清晰的管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. I decided to be just a clear channel to let it flow.
→ {"text": "我決定只做一個清晰的通靈管道，讓它流動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. That's how I proceeded.
→ {"text": "我就是這樣進行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. At the time...
→ {"text": "當時......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. We all have a Higher Self, right?
→ {"text": "我們每個人都有高我，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. We just hadn't contacted it until now.
→ {"text": "只是我們之前一直沒有與它接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. I would connect to my Higher Self then tune into Bashar.
→ {"text": "我會連結我的高我，然後調頻到巴夏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. When you try and reach out to information from "higher realms", whether you're trying to listen to it or watch for it on TV, this is facilitated by your Higher Self.
→ {"text": "當你試圖接觸來自「高層領域」的資訊時，無論是聆聽還是在電視上看，這都是透過你的高我來促成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. It's not just passive listening. You're using your higher consciousness.
→ {"text": "這不只是被動地聆聽。你在運用你的高層意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. This is a great exercise.
→ {"text": "這是很好的練習。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. So then, I started channeling.
→ {"text": "所以，我就開始通靈了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. No matter how far Bashar was, on Essassani or on a spaceship, we were in telepathic contact, so I would receive images instantaneously.
→ {"text": "無論巴夏在多遠的地方，在艾莎莎尼或在太空船上，我們都保持心電感應的聯繫，所以我能立即接收到影像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. He would send layers of information at once like plates stacked on top and I would simply "read" them in Japanese.
→ {"text": "他會一次傳送好幾層資訊，就像盤子堆疊在一起，而我只是用日文「讀」出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. Since my physical mind didn't interfere, I was able to transmit the information clearly.
→ {"text": "因為我的物質頭腦沒有干擾，我能夠清晰地傳遞資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. So at that time, when you put yourself aside, did you step off to the side consciously?
→ {"text": "所以當時，當你將自己放在一邊時，你是有意識地退到一旁嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. Or were you in a completely different space entirely? -Like in a full trance? -Yes, everyone has a different process.
→ {"text": "還是你完全進入了另一個空間？-像是完全出神那樣？-是的，每個人的過程都不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. For me, since I was speaking with Bashar telepathically from the beginning, I would remain fully present so I could hear all the information.
→ {"text": "對我來說，因為我從一開始就用心電感應與巴夏對話，我會保持完全清醒，這樣我才能聽到所有資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. I see, you clearly understood what you were saying then.
→ {"text": "我明白了，那你很清楚自己在說什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. I was fully aware and listening, just like the audience, so I could apply the information to my life.
→ {"text": "我完全保持清醒並在聆聽，就像觀眾一樣，這樣我就能將這些資訊應用到我的生活中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. That's convenient. It'd be a waste to lose it.
→ {"text": "那很方便。失去這些資訊就太可惜了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. You had an advantage compared to other channels who go into full trance.
→ {"text": "相較於那些完全出神的通靈管道，你有優勢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. But nowadays there are fewer and fewer of trance channels.
→ {"text": "但現在出神通靈者越來越少了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. Compared to previous years, or so I've heard.
→ {"text": "跟過去幾年相比，我聽說是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. This is only one perspective, but without going into full trance they couldn't receive higher information.
→ {"text": "這只是一種觀點，但不完全出神的話，他們無法接收高頻資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. But now the collective consciousness is rising and expanding.
→ {"text": "但現在集體意識正在提升和擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. So we can access higher information without getting in the way.
→ {"text": "所以我們可以在不受干擾的情況下接觸高頻資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. That's what's been said.
→ {"text": "大家是這麼說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

477. The signal generated by people's thoughts, which used to get in the way, are now softening.
→ {"text": "過去會造成干擾的人類思維訊號，現在正在軟化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. Yes, it's changed. It's really changed.
→ {"text": "是的，改變了。真的改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. So, to go back to those channeling years...
→ {"text": "所以，回到那些通靈的歲月......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. Two years. -In the 1980's? -Yes, it was in...
→ {"text": "兩年。-在 1980 年代？-對，那是在......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. I started channeling publicly in 1988.
→ {"text": "我在 1988 年開始公開通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. I met Bashar in 1987.
→ {"text": "我在 1987 年遇見巴夏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. I spent two years channeling starting in 1988, so I stopped in 1990...?
→ {"text": "我從 1988 年開始通靈了兩年，所以在 1990 年停止......？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. I channeled in 1988 and 1989. Then in 1990, I'd already quit, I think.
→ {"text": "我在 1988 和 1989 年通靈。然後在 1990 年，我已經停止了，我想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. That was Bashar's wish too because Sassanis share this information to support human's evolution.
→ {"text": "那也是巴夏的願望，因為艾莎莎尼人分享這些資訊是為了支持人類的進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. They support us to not just being passive listeners but integrate the information to awaken.
→ {"text": "他們支持我們不只是被動的聆聽者，而是要整合資訊來覺醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. Not just being a channel, but I reconnected with my true self.
→ {"text": "不只是當個通靈管道，我重新連結了我的真實自我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. I was accessing more and more of that information to further awaken.
→ {"text": "我接觸到越來越多資訊，進一步覺醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. He expressed deep joy at this.
→ {"text": "他對此表達了深深的喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. The more I reconnected with myself, the more my consciousness expanded.
→ {"text": "我越是重新連結自己，我的意識就越擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. It made it easier for me to access different states of consciousness.
→ {"text": "這讓我更容易進入不同的意識狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. I then started using this stream of information to structure it into a class.
→ {"text": "然後我開始運用這股資訊流，將它結構化成課程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. Collaborating with Darryl was from 2008.
→ {"text": "與達瑞爾的合作是從 2008 年開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. Oh, that's pretty recent. You, Darryl and Bashar. 2008, 2010 and 2011.
→ {"text": "哦，那蠻近期的。你、達瑞爾和巴夏。2008、2010 和 2011 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. When you're with Darryl, sharing the stage what's the feeling?
→ {"text": "當你和達瑞爾一起在舞台上時，感覺如何？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. When we are collaborating? Let me see.
→ {"text": "當我們合作的時候？讓我想想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. It's always like this, but I'm always quite plain. -Empty? -Yes, Clear. Transparent.
→ {"text": "總是這樣的，但我總是很平靜。-空嗎？-是的，清澈。透明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. When I take the next step, I don't hold onto anything.
→ {"text": "當我邁出下一步時，我不執著任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. For example, when we collaborate, even more so than doing it alone, it's something of a challenge.
→ {"text": "舉例來說，當我們合作時，比起單獨進行，這更像是一種挑戰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. There's some concerns like, "it's been so long since Bashar and I have collaborated."
→ {"text": "會有些擔憂，像是「我和巴夏已經這麼久沒有合作了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. We've done channeling and communicated telepathically.
→ {"text": "我們做過通靈，也用心電感應溝通過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. But having Darryl channeling Bashar and me there, I wondered if it'd go well.
→ {"text": "但讓達瑞爾通靈巴夏，而我在那裡，我不知道會不會順利。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. But for the most part, insecurity and fear are signs for me to move forward.
→ {"text": "但大多數時候，不安和恐懼對我來說是向前邁進的訊號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. These are opportunities for me to expand.
→ {"text": "這些是我擴展的機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. These are doors to open.
→ {"text": "這些是要打開的門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. If there is fear and insecurities, I use that to propel me forward.
→ {"text": "如果有恐懼和不安，我就用它們來推動自己向前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. So I exchanged fear for excitement and did the collaboration.
→ {"text": "所以我將恐懼轉換成興奮，進行了合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

508. With that in mind when we collaborated, it was like the most exciting thing I could achieve.
→ {"text": "帶著這樣的心態，當我們合作時，那就像是我能達成的最令人興奮的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. It was very exciting.
→ {"text": "非常令人興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. So now, what do I say?
→ {"text": "所以，我該怎麼說呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. Bashar and I would talk back and forth.
→ {"text": "巴夏和我會來回對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. It was a grand transmission. It went across the stage.
→ {"text": "那是一場盛大的交流。能量在舞台上流動著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. It was so much fun.
→ {"text": "太有趣了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. I knew Bashar was having fun too.
→ {"text": "我知道巴夏也玩得很開心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. I could tell.
→ {"text": "我感覺得到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. So there was a first for Darryl when he was channeling, He stood right up while channeling, that hadn't happened before.
→ {"text": "所以達瑞爾在通靈時出現了第一次，他在通靈時站了起來，這之前從未發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. Bashar was so into it, it was a sign of excitement.
→ {"text": "巴夏太投入了，那是興奮的標誌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Oh, we see we just don't fit in again.
→ {"text": "哦，我們看到我們又不適應了。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意不明確，可能是對話者的一句自嘲或場外評論"}

519. Around 1990 to 1991... -Do you know Andrew? -No.

520. He also channeled with Bashar.
→ {"text": "他也通靈過巴夏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. Around 1992, 1991-ish. Maybe for three or four years.
→ {"text": "大約在 1992、1991 年左右。可能持續了三四年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. At that time, through Andrew, Bashar spoke of you. -Oh, really? -From 1990, around that time.
→ {"text": "當時，巴夏透過 Andrew 提到了你。-哦，真的嗎？-從 1990 年左右開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. He said, there will be three entities on Earth who will continue to channel Bashar.
→ {"text": "他說，地球上會有三個存有持續通靈巴夏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. Ayako, Darryl and...

525. Well, a number of people were channeling Bashar.
→ {"text": "嗯，有很多人都在通靈巴夏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
