142. So about a month after the event, I was gazing at infinite space.
→ {"text": "那場經歷發生大約一個月後，我凝視著無限的空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. I thought, "This is outer space" because there seemed to be stars.
→ {"text": "我想「這是外太空」，因為看起來有星星。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. But then, I understood that was just all my consciousness that I had yet to tap into.
→ {"text": "但接著我明白了，那只是我尚未開發的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. And I got a little scared because I'd been taught to live a certain way using but a fragment of my consciousness.
→ {"text": "我有點害怕，因為我一直被教導以某種方式生活，只使用一小部分的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. But I realized that my consciousness was as vast as the Universe.
→ {"text": "但我意識到，我的意識像宇宙一樣廣闊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. It was the first time I ever connected with it.
→ {"text": "那是我第一次連結到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. It was so vast, so limitless.
→ {"text": "它是如此廣闊、如此無限。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. Because I had never experienced to feel limitless, it was scary.
→ {"text": "因為我從未體驗過無限的感覺，所以很可怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. But then...
→ {"text": "但後來……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. The knowledge that "everything is here" immediately filled me with a sense of infinite peace.
→ {"text": "當我知道「一切都在這裡」，立刻感受到無限的平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. What kind of peace?
→ {"text": "什麼樣的平靜？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. As I saw the true expanse of my consciousness as vast as the Universe I knew everything to be there.
→ {"text": "當我看到我的意識真實的廣度，像宇宙一樣廣闊時，我知道一切都在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. That my true consciousness holds as much information as the Universe itself.
→ {"text": "我真實的意識擁有和宇宙本身一樣多的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. All the information is there.
→ {"text": "所有的資訊都在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. Far beyond you learn just here on Earth.
→ {"text": "遠遠超出你在地球上學到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. And knowing everything to be there was a source of profound peace.
→ {"text": "知道一切都在那裡，是深刻平靜的來源。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. It was a peacefulness I'd never experienced.
→ {"text": "那是我從未體驗過的平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. Even though the sense of having no limitation felt overwhelming...
→ {"text": "儘管沒有限制的感覺令人不知所措……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. So there is no need to search for answers outside ourselves? -Because it's all inside? -That's right. -Because it's so big? -Yes.
→ {"text": "所以不需要在自己之外尋找答案？-因為一切都在內在？-沒錯。-因為它很大？-是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. It's as big as the Universe.
→ {"text": "它和宇宙一樣大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. That's the consciousness of my true self.
→ {"text": "那是我真實自我的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. I came to understand that.
→ {"text": "我明白了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. Once I realized that, I wanted to exist here on Earth, using that consciousness.
→ {"text": "一旦我意識到這一點，我想在地球上使用那個意識存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. Not the Earthly consciousness I'd been using with its limitations, belief systems and common sense.
→ {"text": "不是我一直在使用的地球意識，帶著它的限制、信念系統和常識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. I wished to use the totality of my consciousness as expansive, free, peaceful as the Universe.
→ {"text": "我希望使用我意識的全部，像宇宙一樣廣闊、自由、平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. Knowing everything is here fills you with such profound peace.
→ {"text": "知道一切都在這裡，讓你充滿深刻的平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. That serenity and our true consciousness, that's what I wanted to experience here on Earth.
→ {"text": "那種寧靜和我們真實的意識，那是我想在地球上體驗的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. So from there, I... -You returned to the feeling before birth? -True, very true.
→ {"text": "所以從那裡開始，我……-你回到了出生前的感覺？-是的，非常正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. I started to ask myself.
→ {"text": "我開始問自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. "To what extent have I been using limitations," "perspectives, and common sense that I've been taught to believe true?"
→ {"text": "「我在多大程度上使用了限制、觀點，以及我被教導相信為真的常識？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. As I became aware of those layers, I began to let them go progressively as I wanted to return to my true self.
→ {"text": "當我意識到那些層面時，我開始逐步放下它們，因為我想回到真實的自我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. That was the beginning.
→ {"text": "那是開端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. From there, a lot of things began to crumble within myself.
→ {"text": "從那裡開始，很多東西開始在我內在崩解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. When I thought "I can only go this far" I let go of that limitation.
→ {"text": "當我想「我只能走到這裡」時，我放下了那個限制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. And I began to expand into the vastness of my universal consciousness.
→ {"text": "然後我開始擴展到我宇宙意識的廣闊之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. This went on 24/7, even during my sleep.
→ {"text": "這持續進行著，一天二十四小時，連睡眠時也不停止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. There was this one particular incident.
→ {"text": "有一件特別的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. Do you know about the Akashic Records?
→ {"text": "你知道阿卡西記錄嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Yes.
→ {"text": "知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. That information was somehow accessed and began flowing through me.
→ {"text": "那些資訊不知怎麼地被存取了，開始流經我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. And it was constantly coming from my mouth. -Speaking it? -Yes.
→ {"text": "不斷從我嘴裡說出來。-說出來？-對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. I was talking even during my sleep.
→ {"text": "連睡覺時我也在說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. It was so noisy that I'd wake myself up.
→ {"text": "太吵了，我會把自己吵醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. And I'd realize it was only me so I'd go back to sleep.
→ {"text": "然後我意識到只有我一個人，就再睡回去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. Many things within me were coming back online.
→ {"text": "我內在的很多東西正在重新上線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. Was it your own Akashic?
→ {"text": "是你自己的阿卡西嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. No, it was the Universe's Akashic Record, I think.
→ {"text": "不是，我想是宇宙的阿卡西記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. Did you receive the information as images or feelings?
→ {"text": "你接收到的資訊是影像還是感覺？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. Or did they come out in a combination?
→ {"text": "還是結合在一起？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. Was one expression stronger? Mostly images?
→ {"text": "哪一種表達方式比較強？大多是影像？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. Or mostly words?
→ {"text": "還是大多是文字？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. I'd see images and that would be translated into words.
→ {"text": "我會看到影像，然後轉譯成文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. Like in a movie, all this information would come at once.
→ {"text": "就像電影一樣，所有資訊一次全部湧來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. So as I watched the images I would translate them. -Like an interpreter? -Exactly.
→ {"text": "所以當我看著影像時，我會翻譯它們。-像個翻譯員？-沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. A part of me that is aware of what was taking place was allowing the download for the part of me that is unaware.
→ {"text": "我之中覺察到發生什麼的部分，在為我之中不覺察的部分允許下載。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. So the information was accessed through the part of me who knew.
→ {"text": "所以資訊是透過我之中知曉的部分被存取的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. It was a restoration of sorts.
→ {"text": "這是某種恢復。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. There was the "limited me" who had been fast asleep on Earth.
→ {"text": "有一個「受限的我」在地球上沉睡著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. She'd forgotten that all the information was right there.
→ {"text": "她忘記了所有資訊就在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. It was like remembering it through this process.
→ {"text": "就像透過這個過程回憶起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. Did you understand the images you were seeing?
→ {"text": "你理解你看到的影像嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. No, there was no need for me to comprehend it.
→ {"text": "不，我不需要理解它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. This was only happening to restore the knowing part of my consciousness.
→ {"text": "這只是為了恢復我意識中知曉的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. I was much too "asleep" then to comprehend what was being presented to me.
→ {"text": "我當時太「沉睡」了，無法理解呈現給我的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. I knew it was okay not to be able to understand right then.
→ {"text": "我知道當時不理解沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. But I also knew that my "truth" was being downloaded more and more.
→ {"text": "但我也知道，我的「真相」正在越來越多地被下載。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. That the aspects of me that were preventing the truth from coming through were starting to fall away.
→ {"text": "那些阻止真相流入的我的面向，開始脫落了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. I was aware of that.
→ {"text": "我意識到了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. But I knew I didn't need to understand the information at that time.
→ {"text": "但我知道我當時不需要理解那些資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. I knew that in time I'd come to understand what is relevant, and also it was like creating a better pathway.
→ {"text": "我知道到時候我會理解相關的東西，而且這也像是在創造一條更好的通道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. Clearing the pipe.
→ {"text": "清理管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. Come to think of it, this was right before Bashar began contacting me.
→ {"text": "仔細想想，這正好就在巴夏開始聯繫我之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. I feel this was a step in preparation to become the clearest pipe for him as much as possible.
→ {"text": "我覺得這是為了盡可能成為最清晰的管道而準備的步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. So that the part of me who was asleep wouldn't get in the way, and allow the high-frequency information to be downloaded.
→ {"text": "這樣我之中沉睡的部分就不會妨礙，讓高頻資訊能夠被下載。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. So in July 1987, when Bashar contacted me, it was incredibly smooth.
→ {"text": "所以在 1987 年 7 月巴夏聯繫我時，過程非常順利。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. Did you say, it went on 24/7?
→ {"text": "你說這持續了二十四小時？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. After the dream?
→ {"text": "在那個夢之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. Yes, part of my consciousness that was asleep was cracked open.
→ {"text": "是的，我意識中沉睡的部分被裂開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. And the downloading began to facilitate the higher information to flow into me.
→ {"text": "下載開始了，讓高頻資訊流入我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. This process went on for days on end, for about a month.
→ {"text": "這個過程持續了好幾天，大約一個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Sometimes, I would just be sitting and I'd suddenly lose consciousness.
→ {"text": "有時候，我就坐著，然後突然失去意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. For about five or ten minutes.
→ {"text": "大約五到十分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. And then I'd wake up just as quickly.
→ {"text": "然後就一樣快速地醒來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. This was so I didn't get in the way.
→ {"text": "這樣我就不會妨礙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Since this incoming information was so different from what I knew it was better for me to be unconscious so that I wouldn't question it.
→ {"text": "因為這些流入的資訊與我所知道的如此不同，我最好失去意識，這樣我就不會質疑它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. Makes it more accessible, I see.
→ {"text": "讓它更容易被接收，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. Without warning, I would slip into it and come back to myself just as quickly.
→ {"text": "沒有預警地，我會滑入那個狀態，然後一樣快速地回到自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. That went on for about a month. -I bet everyone was worried. -I told no one about it. -How about when you passed out? -Only happened when I was alone.
→ {"text": "這持續了大約一個月。-我想大家一定很擔心。-我沒有告訴任何人。-那你昏倒時怎麼辦？-只有在我獨處時才會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. So you didn't pass out in front of anyone?
→ {"text": "所以你沒有在任何人面前昏倒？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. No, there was none of that. -If that was the case... -Yes, they'd ask what's wrong.
→ {"text": "沒有，沒有那種情況。-如果是那樣的話……-對，他們會問怎麼了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Whoever was doing it, he or she had consideration for me.
→ {"text": "不管是誰做的，他或她都體貼著我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. Did you ever think, "Oh no, I need to go to the hospital!"
→ {"text": "你有沒有想過「糟了，我需要去醫院！」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. Never. I was fine. -You knew. -I had extreme faith and trust.
→ {"text": "從來沒有。我很好。-你知道。-我有極大的信心和信任。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. I have a friend who had absolutely no interest in UFOs.
→ {"text": "我有個朋友對不明飛行物完全沒興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. But she had a sudden download and contacted me, freaking out.
→ {"text": "但她突然有了下載，嚇壞了聯繫我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. She said, "I'm scared! Should I go to the hospital?"
→ {"text": "她說「我好害怕！我該去醫院嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. People come to me like that.
→ {"text": "人們就是這樣來找我的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Soon we'll have the opposite reaction.
→ {"text": "很快我們會有相反的反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. Everyone's consciousness will start to expand.
→ {"text": "每個人的意識都會開始擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Our gaze will widen into space, giving ourselves permission to awaken.
→ {"text": "我們的目光會擴展到太空，允許自己覺醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. I agree.
→ {"text": "我同意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. There are more and more people who are aware that there's more than this tiny box and opening up their minds.
→ {"text": "越來越多人意識到有比這個小盒子更多的東西，正在打開他們的心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
