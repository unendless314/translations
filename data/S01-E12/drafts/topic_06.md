915. Unless they're maybe perceived through a negative filter, which would be the Black Eyed children.

## Speaker Group 306

916. OK, I'm glad you brought that up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

917. Because I was thinking of bringing that up, but I didn't want to bring any negativity into this session.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

918. So, Black Eyed children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

919. What are they?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

920. Well, I mean--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

921. People can go online and search all the Black Eyed children stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

922. But what is your interpretation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

923. I think it is my belief that Black Eyed children are a hybrid children perceived through a negative ego filter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

924. There could be some freak creepy children coming into this dimension or something that are Black Eyed children too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

925. But after hearing that experience with the guy that I just told you about, that the kids are knocking on his door, and he perceived their eyes as black-- like black kind of scary eyes-- and I'm going, OK, I know where his ego is at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

926. He does not want to look at this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

927. And then he is then perceiving them as super creepy and super scary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

928. And so I'm going, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

929. Like, I'm thinking that that is--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

930. So the Black Eyed children aren't necessarily negative, it's the people who are perceiving them have those negative projections that are giving to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

931. So therefore, they're telling the world, I don't want you to open the door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

932. They're going to come in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

933. And they're going to kill you and cut you to pieces, and put you in the freezer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

934. [LAUGHS] Sorry, so don't do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

935. Don't open the door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

936. Even though they're like kind of cute and they need help, and they're super pysch, and everything else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

937. But they need your blood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

938. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 312

939. They're going to suck you dry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

940. [LAUGHS] Because that's how, typically, the Black Eyed children are perceived, in a lot of ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

941. They are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

942. And maybe there are creepy, like-- you know, there are dark energies and spirits that I've worked with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

943. You think of maybe a few in the first batch didn't quite go a certain way?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 315

944. Maybe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

945. Yeah, they dropped them off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

946. And they're like, let's just make this a horror show.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

947. Yeah, let's just throw them back at the parents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

948. Let's not deal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

949. So even up in the craft, they're like, we can't deal with these kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

950. Genetic experiment went wrong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 318

951. We gotta drop those humans-- yeah, especially the ones that really aren't accepting this information very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

952. Let's just give them a little taste.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 319

953. Maybe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

954. I mean--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 320

955. Oh my goodness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 321

956. Who knows?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 322

957. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

958. I like that perspective on the Black Eyed children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

959. It kind of makes sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

960. So this other guy you're talking about, his perception was kind of the standard Black Eyed children perception?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 323

961. Yeah, it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

962. That's how he described it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

963. But you, at the same time, were getting direct communication from them saying, we just want to communicate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

964. And like, darling energies, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

965. Like, really sweet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

966. And I know dark energies, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

967. I used to clear poltergeists in houses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

968. Like, I'm OK with that energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

969. And if it was that, that's cool.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

970. I'd honor that, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

971. But it isn't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

972. But in some cases, maybe, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

973. Like we said, it's a little--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

974. I mean, and even if it is, I think you can transmute it in a sense by-- again, we create our own realities with wherever we project on whatever it is we're going to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

975. So if we're going to project that, we're going to create that in our own heads, even if it's not really that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

976. And same thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

977. It could be totally negative, and you can transmute it to something positive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

978. And that's a good thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

979. I don't see anything negative with transforming the negative into positive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

980. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

981. So even if these demon kids, black eyes, fangs, and blood sucking-- even if you did show love and compassion, you can still transmute it into something lovely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

982. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

983. So there is no negative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

984. Even if it's negative, you can still transmute it into a positive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

985. So whichever scenario you go down, why not open your arms and give these kids a big hug?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

986. And a cup of juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

987. And a cup of juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

988. A cup of juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

989. Every child--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

990. I was going to say glass of milk, but we're going away from-- we're going to go with a glass of juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 334

991. Glass of juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

992. Not from concentrate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 335

993. Not from concentrate, fresh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 336

994. Fresh juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

995. We can do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

996. Non-pasteurized, very good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

997. Organic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 340

998. Organic juice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

999. I like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1000. Cool.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1001. Well, that's a lot of information, and a lot to chew on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1002. I think the sun's going down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1003. It might be a good place to wrap this up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1004. Thank you very much, Bridget.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1005. This was awesome information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1006. And I'd love to continue to see how this develops
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

1007. Sounds great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

1008. We'd love to see more of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

1009. Thank you, Reuben.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 344

1010. Awesome, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

1011. [MEDITATIVE MUSIC] [LAUGHS]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 345

1012. We can have hot tea in there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 346

1013. OK. Good, good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
