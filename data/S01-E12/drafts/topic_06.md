915. Unless they're maybe perceived through a negative filter, which would be the Black Eyed children.
→ {"text": "除非他們可能是被透過負面濾鏡看待的，那就是黑眼小孩的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

916. OK, I'm glad you brought that up.
→ {"text": "好的，我很高興你提到這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

917. Because I was thinking of bringing that up, but I didn't want to bring any negativity into this session.
→ {"text": "因為我本來也想提這個話題，但我不想在這次訪談中帶入任何負面的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

918. So, Black Eyed children.
→ {"text": "所以，黑眼小孩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

919. What are they?
→ {"text": "他們是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

920. Well, I mean--
→ {"text": "呃，我的意思是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

921. People can go online and search all the Black Eyed children stuff.
→ {"text": "大家可以上網搜尋所有關於黑眼小孩的資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

922. But what is your interpretation?
→ {"text": "但你的解讀是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

923. I think it is my belief that Black Eyed children are a hybrid children perceived through a negative ego filter.
→ {"text": "我認為，我相信黑眼小孩就是混種小孩被透過負面的小我濾鏡所看待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

924. There could be some freak creepy children coming into this dimension or something that are Black Eyed children too.
→ {"text": "也可能確實有一些詭異恐怖的小孩進入這個維度，也就是真正的黑眼小孩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

925. But after hearing that experience with the guy that I just told you about, that the kids are knocking on his door, and he perceived their eyes as black-- like black kind of scary eyes-- and I'm going, OK, I know where his ego is at.
→ {"text": "但在聽到我剛剛跟你說的那個人的經歷後——小孩們敲他的門，他把他們的眼睛看成是黑色的，就像是黑色的那種恐怖眼睛——我就想，好吧，我知道他的小我在什麼狀態了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

926. He does not want to look at this.
→ {"text": "他根本不想面對這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

927. And then he is then perceiving them as super creepy and super scary.
→ {"text": "所以他就把他們看成是超級詭異、超級恐怖的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

928. And so I'm going, yeah.
→ {"text": "所以我就想，是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

929. Like, I'm thinking that that is--
→ {"text": "我覺得那就是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

930. So the Black Eyed children aren't necessarily negative, it's the people who are perceiving them have those negative projections that are giving to them.
→ {"text": "所以黑眼小孩本身不一定是負面的，而是觀察他們的人帶有那些負面投射，把這些投射加諸在他們身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

931. So therefore, they're telling the world, I don't want you to open the door.
→ {"text": "所以他們就告訴全世界，我不希望你開門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

932. They're going to come in.
→ {"text": "他們會進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

933. And they're going to kill you and cut you to pieces, and put you in the freezer.
→ {"text": "然後他們會殺了你，把你切成碎片，丟進冷凍櫃裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

934. [LAUGHS] Sorry, so don't do it.
→ {"text": "【笑聲】抱歉，所以別這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

935. Don't open the door.
→ {"text": "別開門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

936. Even though they're like kind of cute and they need help, and they're super pysch, and everything else.
→ {"text": "即使他們看起來有點可愛，需要幫助，而且他們超有靈力，還有其他種種特質。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "pysch 可能是 psychic 的口語縮寫"}

937. But they need your blood.
→ {"text": "但他們需要你的血。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

938. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 312

939. They're going to suck you dry.
→ {"text": "他們會把你的血吸乾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

940. [LAUGHS] Because that's how, typically, the Black Eyed children are perceived, in a lot of ways.
→ {"text": "【笑聲】因為這就是黑眼小孩通常被看待的方式，在很多方面都是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

941. They are.
→ {"text": "確實是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

942. And maybe there are creepy, like-- you know, there are dark energies and spirits that I've worked with.
→ {"text": "而且也許確實有一些詭異的——你知道，我處理過一些黑暗能量和靈體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

943. You think of maybe a few in the first batch didn't quite go a certain way?
→ {"text": "你覺得會不會是第一批裡面有幾個沒有按照預期發展？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "此處指混種計畫第一批可能有失敗案例"}


## Speaker Group 315

944. Maybe.
→ {"text": "也許吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

945. Yeah, they dropped them off.
→ {"text": "是啊，他們把那些小孩放下來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

946. And they're like, let's just make this a horror show.
→ {"text": "然後他們就想，那就讓這變成一場恐怖秀吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

947. Yeah, let's just throw them back at the parents.
→ {"text": "對啊，我們就把他們丟回給父母吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

948. Let's not deal.
→ {"text": "我們不處理了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

949. So even up in the craft, they're like, we can't deal with these kids.
→ {"text": "所以即使在飛船上，他們也會說，我們搞不定這些小孩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

950. Genetic experiment went wrong.
→ {"text": "基因實驗出錯了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我們得把那些人類放下去——對，尤其是那些真的很不能接受這些資訊的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

952. Let's just give them a little taste.
→ {"text": "就讓他們稍微體驗一下吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 319

953. Maybe.

958. I like that perspective on the Black Eyed children.
→ {"text": "我喜歡你對黑眼小孩的這種觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

959. It kind of makes sense.
→ {"text": "這有點道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

960. So this other guy you're talking about, his perception was kind of the standard Black Eyed children perception?
→ {"text": "所以你說的那個人，他的看法就是那種典型的黑眼小孩看法？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 323

961. Yeah, it was.
→ {"text": "對，就是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

962. That's how he described it.
→ {"text": "他就是那樣描述的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

963. But you, at the same time, were getting direct communication from them saying, we just want to communicate.
→ {"text": "但你同時卻從他們那裡收到直接的訊息，說我們只是想溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

964. And like, darling energies, you know?
→ {"text": "而且像是那種可愛的能量，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

965. Like, really sweet.
→ {"text": "真的很甜美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

966. And I know dark energies, you know?
→ {"text": "我也認識黑暗能量，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

967. I used to clear poltergeists in houses.
→ {"text": "我以前會清除房子裡的騷靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

968. Like, I'm OK with that energy.
→ {"text": "我對那種能量沒問題的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

969. And if it was that, that's cool.
→ {"text": "如果真的是那樣，那也沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

970. I'd honor that, you know?
→ {"text": "我會尊重那個，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

971. But it isn't.
→ {"text": "但事實不是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

972. But in some cases, maybe, you know?
→ {"text": "但在某些情況下，也許真的是那樣，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

973. Like we said, it's a little--
→ {"text": "就像我們說的，這有點——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

974. I mean, and even if it is, I think you can transmute it in a sense by-- again, we create our own realities with wherever we project on whatever it is we're going to do.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，即使真的是那樣，我認為你也可以在某種程度上轉化它——再說一次，我們用自己的投射創造自己的實相，無論我們要投射什麼、要做什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

975. So if we're going to project that, we're going to create that in our own heads, even if it's not really that.
→ {"text": "所以如果我們要投射那個，我們就會在自己的腦海中創造那個，即使實際上不是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

976. And same thing.
→ {"text": "同樣的道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

977. It could be totally negative, and you can transmute it to something positive.
→ {"text": "它可能完全是負面的，但你可以把它轉化成正面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

978. And that's a good thing.
→ {"text": "而這是好事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

979. I don't see anything negative with transforming the negative into positive.
→ {"text": "我不覺得把負面轉化為正面有什麼不好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

980. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

981. So even if these demon kids, black eyes, fangs, and blood sucking-- even if you did show love and compassion, you can still transmute it into something lovely.
→ {"text": "所以即使這些惡魔小孩、黑眼睛、尖牙、吸血——即使你真的對他們展現愛與慈悲，你仍然可以把它轉化成美好的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

982. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

983. So there is no negative.
→ {"text": "所以沒有負面這回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

984. Even if it's negative, you can still transmute it into a positive.
→ {"text": "即使它是負面的，你還是可以把它轉化成正面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

985. So whichever scenario you go down, why not open your arms and give these kids a big hug?
→ {"text": "所以無論你選擇哪種情境，何不敞開雙臂給這些小孩一個大大的擁抱？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331
