## Speaker Group 151

457. You found out you have hybrid children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. You're part of this program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. What is the program, if you can... what's going on?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

460. The program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. It's a program designed to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

462. OK, the program designed to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

463. And connect Earth with its greater other aspects, its galactic family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. So it's to merge galactic family with the Earth family, as well as wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. And all those are waking up humanity, that process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

466. So it's a multi-level type program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

467. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. There's many reasons to it, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

469. And one of them, which-- like I said, is the first time I even heard it put it that way, to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. And I can totally see that happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. But usually, it's perceived in a negative context.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

472. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. It starts with like the understanding of maybe a negative context through the abduction program, which most people know about, which is a connection of the Zeta Reticuli, which is a parallel reality human, and also is part of our original DNA strand in us, which is kind of freaky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. So it's like they're taking themselves, because it's themselves in another dimension, as well as we have that genetics in us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. So it's like taking family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. So it's much more intertwined and at home than seems to be some like beings like from another world, being like, aaaargh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. It's closer to home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

478. Right, but many aspects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. So it's multi-dimensional as far as them being an aspect of us having their DNA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. It's not just one thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

481. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

482. Within that program--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

483. --within that program, within all of that stuff--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

484. --intergalactic contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

485. --that's gonna wake us up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. I mean, that's gonna jostle people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. That's gonna like set off every trigger of the ego perceivable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

488. Well, it has.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. I mean, if you talk to any of the thousands of abductees-- hundreds of thousands, and estimated millions-- then, it's rocked some worlds out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

490. Yeah, definitely rocked some worlds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

491. Sounds like your world was rocked a little bit too?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

492. Rocked my world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. Changed my world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. And in the program, which is commonly known, semen and eggs, genetic material is taken from these abductees.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. And that is meant to create other beings, meant to create the five hybrid civilizations-- five different hybrid civilizations-- as well as the hybrid children, also known as the freelancers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. And these particular kids are the ones going to be coming to Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. So it's five civilizations that have their own planets, have evolved on, as well as these kids coming to Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. And all this has taken place in, give or take, about a 100 year period of Earth time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

499. Wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. So, I mean, this is, hybrids from us, from humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. So humanity is responsible for kind of igniting five other civilizations on other planets?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

502. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. They each have their own planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

504. They each have their own planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. And so, wow, humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

506. We're their ancestors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

507. And we don't even know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

508. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

509. Our DNA is seeding these others, which makes you kind of think how many other civilizations seeded humanity?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

510. Oh, I like that tie-in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

511. And if so, were those races even aware or conscious that they were seeding another civilization at the time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. So that's the big question you always see on "Ancient Aliens" or something. Are we - we're aliens!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. You know, where do we come from?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. The missing DNA chromosome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. We had a genetic leap from the apes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. What is that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. Where did that come from?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

518. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. We're hybrids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. And distinguishing that-- I guess at this moment, is good-- is that we're all hybrids, and that it's a part of the greater galactic story that we seed each other-- that we seed consciousness, that we seed beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. So say, the abduction program taken just in that context, it might seem weird.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. But in a greater context, it's like, well who seeded us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. And with that, to my knowledge or what I've gotten, is that there's seven different extraterrestrial genetics that are involved in the seeding of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. And that have then gone forward.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. And so we have those lineages in us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. And that's why our genetic material is awesome for the Grays to utilize in creating the hybrid civilizations, as well as the hybrid children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

527. So you mentioned Grays.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. Let's just kind of identify that a little bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. Grays, meaning, is that the typical term for the beings from the Zeta Reticuli?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

530. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

531. And that's mostly these beings that you see in movies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

532. Yeah, big eyes, big heads.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. There's a lot different kinds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. You know, there's ones that are super negatively-oriented, ones that have worked with the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. There's a few different kinds, different timelines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

536. So we can say-- and I'm glad you mentioned that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. So we see these Gray beings, doesn't necessarily mean just like with humans, we have different color skin mean just like with humans, we have different color skin humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. Not all the Grays-- even though they may be grayish-- are there some brown Grays?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

539. I think that they're all pretty gray.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. But they could have different, say motivations or different energies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. So there are some that are like incredibly benevolent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. And then there's some that have really taken a turn based on this hybrid program, and come to a little bit more of a balanced place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

543. So you think initially, the ones before they engaged into this hybridization program, were maybe not as nice?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

544. Well, there they're fifth dimensional beings, but they're negatively-oriented.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. So they have all the technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. They have of the genetic know-how.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. They have all of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. But they are negatively-oriented, and they're more hive mentality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. And so at the beginning of the program, it was a lot more intense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. They didn't know how to work with humans because they genetically modified their emotions out of themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. But through this program, we sparked something in them that made them, to the best of their ability, understand more of the emotional body, and start to understand how to work with us in a way that doesn't completely freak us out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

552. So probably the abductions that are happening now are less aggressive, a little more compassionate than maybe some of the abductions that were happening 10 or 20 years ago, in the early days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. In the Benny and Barney Hill, the Whitney Strieber and some of these early records that we have of this happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

554. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

555. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

556. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

557. Are there still bad ones out there, you think?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

558. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

559. When we say bad?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. You know, I mean like ones that aren't as compassionate, I would say, like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

561. And for the most part, most of the Zeta Reticuli have died off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

562. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. That's why there was an urgency to do this, you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. Because they couldn't reproduce.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. And so they needed a way to continue on, in a way that was continuing on with them, which is us, in a different way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. So, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

567. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. So we've got more than five, or around five races out there with humans kind of helping to seed that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. What's the next steps?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. Where do we go from here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

571. The next steps.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. The next steps are that there's many different possible timelines of what is going to happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. So then we get into more of the timeline metaphysical probability of someone's personal incarnational choice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. And through that, there's timelines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. Because right now is when the Grays split off from human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. This is like us right now, in the future, in a certain timeline became a Gray.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. Genetically modified ourselves, went underground in underground tunnels and, like, evolved in a certain way, with focus on the intellect versus emotion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

578. Did they say why they went to the underground tunnels?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

579. Well, because they started destroying the planet too much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. But my personal opinion is that it's like the government underground scenario.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. So it's kind of future government ended up becoming that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. It's my own kind of take on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

583. So Grays are humans?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

584. Yeah, but just mutated humans from a different parallel reality Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. So it's not necessarily like this Earth, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

586. So if you go out to outer space, you end up bumping into Earth again?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

587. Could be, in a future timeline.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. I mean, it's all so intertwined, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

589. It's kind of starting to make sense to me a little bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. I'm seeing different things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. I'm hearing different things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. But we'll let the audience decide if it makes sense to them or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. But I mean, that totally makes sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. You know, you have the whole Denver airport big underground tunnel thing, with all the craziness and underground dulce.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. And you have all of this stuff, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. And George Bush buying up all the mountains in Europe, and like building caves and caverns.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. So I can see how humanity could have gone, or still, I guess, could go that direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

598. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. And then the other one, the other direction--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

600. The other direction--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

601. --which is my direction, my focus, I would say your focus too, is the complete and utter transformation into the fifth dimension, and the shifting of Earth to a healed space and like a united humanity and oneness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. And galactic contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. So that is the other timeline.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

604. So they kind of saw, since they lived that timeline, they kind of saw OK, this is what happens if we make these choices and we live in this timeline.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

605. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

606. So let's go back, and let's tell ourselves a different story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. And let's create a different future, because living in underground tunnels because the world's too toxic to live in, sucks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

608. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. It doesn't end up working.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

610. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

611. It hits me really deep to think that the most kind of negative-- like, it's like, oh, the government, oh, Monsanto-- that they end up going so far down into the depths of darkness, that they end up coming back full circle, which is a beautiful exercise in, like, darkness to light, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. And a different perspective on looking at this simultaneous government that we see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. All of the realities are, like, all jumbled right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. And then they'll start breaking off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. But right now, it's like, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. I'm like, wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. The chemtrails.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. Like, you end up saving me, like, in a different version, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. And so it puts it into perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

620. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. Many different perspectives, but yes, a perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

622. It puts it into a perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

623. It does put it into a perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. You have a little mothy thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. There we go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. It's your friend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. Hi, friend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. OK, now you can come say hi to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. Do we just keep going?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

632. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
