## Speaker Group 151

457. You found out you have hybrid children.
→ {"text": "你發現自己有混種孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. You're part of this program.
→ {"text": "你是這個計畫的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. What is the program, if you can... what's going on?
→ {"text": "這個計畫是什麼?如果你能說的話⋯⋯到底是怎麼回事?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

460. The program.
→ {"text": "這個計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. It's a program designed to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "是一個協助喚醒人類的計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

462. OK, the program designed to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "好,一個用來喚醒人類的計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

463. And connect Earth with its greater other aspects, its galactic family.
→ {"text": "並且讓地球與它更廣大的其他面向連結，也就是它的星際家族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "galactic family 使用術語表的「星際家族」"}

464. So it's to merge galactic family with the Earth family, as well as wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "所以這是要讓星際家族與地球家族融合,同時喚醒人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. And all those are waking up humanity, that process.
→ {"text": "而這一切都是喚醒人類的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

466. So it's a multi-level type program.
→ {"text": "所以這是個多層次的計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

467. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. There's many reasons to it, yes.
→ {"text": "它有很多理由沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

469. And one of them, which-- like I said, is the first time I even heard it put it that way, to help wake up humanity.
→ {"text": "其中一個理由，就像我說的，我是第一次聽到這樣的說法，就是要幫忙喚醒人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. And I can totally see that happening.
→ {"text": "而我完全能看見這件事正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. But usually, it's perceived in a negative context.
→ {"text": "但通常這會被放在負面的脈絡裡看待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

472. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. It starts with like the understanding of maybe a negative context through the abduction program, which most people know about, which is a connection of the Zeta Reticuli, which is a parallel reality human, and also is part of our original DNA strand in us, which is kind of freaky.
→ {"text": "這從對綁架計畫的理解開始,大部分人都知道的那種,可能會覺得是負面的——這跟網罟座有關,他們是平行實相中的人類,而且也是我們原始 DNA 鏈的一部分,這有點詭異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Zeta Reticuli 使用術語表的「網罟座」; reality 使用術語表的「實相」"}

474. So it's like they're taking themselves, because it's themselves in another dimension, as well as we have that genetics in us.
→ {"text": "所以這就像他們在採集他們自己,因為那是另一個維度裡的他們自己,而我們體內也有那份基因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "dimension 使用術語表的「維度」"}

475. So it's like taking family.
→ {"text": "所以這就像是在採集家人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. So it's much more intertwined and at home than seems to be some like beings like from another world, being like, aaaargh.
→ {"text": "所以這比起那種來自另一個世界的存有、感覺像是「啊啊啊」那樣,要更加交織、更接近家的感覺。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "beings 使用術語表的「存有」;原文的 aaaargh 保留語氣"}

477. It's closer to home.
→ {"text": "這離家更近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

478. Right, but many aspects.
→ {"text": "對,但有很多面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. So it's multi-dimensional as far as them being an aspect of us having their DNA.
→ {"text": "所以就他們是我們的一個面向、我們擁有他們的 DNA 這件事來說,這是多維度的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. It's not just one thing.
→ {"text": "這不只是一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

481. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

482. Within that program--
→ {"text": "在那個計畫裡面——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

483. --within that program, within all of that stuff--
→ {"text": "——在那個計畫裡面,在所有那些事情當中——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

484. --intergalactic contact.
→ {"text": "——星際接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

485. --that's gonna wake us up.
→ {"text": "——那會喚醒我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. I mean, that's gonna jostle people.
→ {"text": "我是說,那會震撼人們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. That's gonna like set off every trigger of the ego perceivable.
→ {"text": "那會觸發小我所有能被觸發的點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ego 使用術語表的「小我」"}


## Speaker Group 165

488. Well, it has.
→ {"text": "嗯,它已經在這樣做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. I mean, if you talk to any of the thousands of abductees-- hundreds of thousands, and estimated millions-- then, it's rocked some worlds out there.
→ {"text": "我是說,如果你去跟那些被綁架者中的任何一個談談——數千人、數十萬人,估計有數百萬人——那麼,它確實震撼了不少人的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

490. Yeah, definitely rocked some worlds.
→ {"text": "對啊,確實震撼了不少人的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

491. Sounds like your world was rocked a little bit too?
→ {"text": "聽起來你的世界也被震撼了一點?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

492. Rocked my world.
→ {"text": "震撼了我的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. Changed my world.
→ {"text": "改變了我的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. And in the program, which is commonly known, semen and eggs, genetic material is taken from these abductees.
→ {"text": "在這個計畫中——這是大家都知道的——精子和卵子,也就是基因物質,會從這些被綁架者身上取得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. And that is meant to create other beings, meant to create the five hybrid civilizations-- five different hybrid civilizations-- as well as the hybrid children, also known as the freelancers.
→ {"text": "而這是用來創造其他存有,用來創造五個混種文明——五個不同的混種文明——以及混種孩子,也被稱為自由探索者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "beings 使用術語表的「存有」;hybrid 使用術語表的「混種」;freelancers 音譯為「自由探索者」"}

496. And these particular kids are the ones going to be coming to Earth.
→ {"text": "而這些特定的孩子就是那些將要來到地球的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. So it's five civilizations that have their own planets, have evolved on, as well as these kids coming to Earth.
→ {"text": "所以是五個文明,他們有自己的星球並在上面演化,還有這些要來地球的孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. And all this has taken place in, give or take, about a 100 year period of Earth time.
→ {"text": "而這一切都發生在大約一百年的地球時間裡,誤差不大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

499. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. So, I mean, this is, hybrids from us, from humans.
→ {"text": "所以,我是說,這是來自我們的混種,來自人類的混種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. So humanity is responsible for kind of igniting five other civilizations on other planets?
→ {"text": "所以人類在某種程度上負責點燃其他星球上的五個文明?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

502. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. They each have their own planet.
→ {"text": "他們各自有自己的星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

504. They each have their own planet.
→ {"text": "他們各自有自己的星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. And so, wow, humans.
→ {"text": "所以,哇,人類啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

506. We're their ancestors.
→ {"text": "我們是他們的祖先。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

507. And we don't even know.
→ {"text": "而我們甚至不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

508. No.
→ {"text": "不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

509. Our DNA is seeding these others, which makes you kind of think how many other civilizations seeded humanity?
→ {"text": "我們的 DNA 正在播種給這些其他文明,這讓你不禁會想,有多少其他文明曾經播種給人類?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

510. Oh, I like that tie-in.
→ {"text": "喔,我喜歡這個連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

511. And if so, were those races even aware or conscious that they were seeding another civilization at the time?
→ {"text": "如果是這樣,那些種族當時是否意識到、知道他們正在播種另一個文明?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. So that's the big question you always see on "Ancient Aliens" or something. Are we - we're aliens!
→ {"text": "所以這就是你在《遠古外星人》之類的節目中總是看到的大問題:我們是——我們就是外星人!", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Ancient Aliens 使用術語表的「遠古外星人」"}

513. You know, where do we come from?
→ {"text": "你知道的,我們從哪裡來?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. The missing DNA chromosome.
→ {"text": "那條缺失的 DNA 染色體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. We had a genetic leap from the apes.
→ {"text": "我們從猿類有了一個基因躍進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. What is that?
→ {"text": "那是什麼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. Where did that come from?
→ {"text": "那從哪裡來的?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

518. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. We're hybrids.
→ {"text": "我們是混種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "hybrid 使用術語表的「混種」"}

520. And distinguishing that-- I guess at this moment, is good-- is that we're all hybrids, and that it's a part of the greater galactic story that we seed each other-- that we seed consciousness, that we seed beings.
→ {"text": "而要區分的是——我想在此刻說明這點是好的——我們全都是混種,而這是更宏大的星際故事的一部分,我們彼此播種——我們播種意識,我們播種存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "consciousness 使用術語表的「意識」;beings 使用術語表的「存有」"}

521. So say, the abduction program taken just in that context, it might seem weird.
→ {"text": "所以說,如果只在那個脈絡下看綁架計畫,可能會覺得很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. But in a greater context, it's like, well who seeded us?
→ {"text": "但在更宏大的脈絡下,就像是,那誰播種了我們?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. And with that, to my knowledge or what I've gotten, is that there's seven different extraterrestrial genetics that are involved in the seeding of us.
→ {"text": "關於這點,就我所知或我所接收到的,有七種不同的外星基因參與了對我們的播種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. And that have then gone forward.
→ {"text": "然後那些基因就往前發展了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

525. And so we have those lineages in us.
→ {"text": "所以我們體內有那些血統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. And that's why our genetic material is awesome for the Grays to utilize in creating the hybrid civilizations, as well as the hybrid children.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我們的基因物質對灰人來說很棒,可以用來創造混種文明,以及混種孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Grays 使用術語表「灰人」"}


## Speaker Group 179

527. So you mentioned Grays.
→ {"text": "所以你提到了灰人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. Let's just kind of identify that a little bit.
→ {"text": "讓我們稍微確認一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. Grays, meaning, is that the typical term for the beings from the Zeta Reticuli?
→ {"text": "灰人,是指來自網罟座的存有的典型稱呼嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

530. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

531. And that's mostly these beings that you see in movies.
→ {"text": "而那些主要就是你在電影裡看到的那些存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

532. Yeah, big eyes, big heads.
→ {"text": "對,大眼睛、大頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. There's a lot different kinds.
→ {"text": "有很多不同種類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. You know, there's ones that are super negatively-oriented, ones that have worked with the government.
→ {"text": "你知道,有些是極度負面導向的,有些曾與政府合作過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. There's a few different kinds, different timelines.
→ {"text": "有幾種不同的種類,不同的時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

536. So we can say-- and I'm glad you mentioned that.
→ {"text": "所以我們可以說——我很高興你提到這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. So we see these Gray beings, doesn't necessarily mean just like with humans, we have different color skin mean just like with humans, we have different color skin humans.
→ {"text": "所以我們看到這些灰人存有,並不一定意味著——就像人類一樣,我們有不同膚色的人類。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文有重複,簡化翻譯使其通順"}

538. Not all the Grays-- even though they may be grayish-- are there some brown Grays?
→ {"text": "不是所有灰人——儘管他們可能是灰色的——有沒有一些棕色的灰人?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

539. I think that they're all pretty gray.
→ {"text": "我想他們全都是灰色的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. But they could have different, say motivations or different energies.
→ {"text": "但他們可能有不同的動機或不同的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "energy 使用術語表的「能量」"}

541. So there are some that are like incredibly benevolent.
→ {"text": "所以有些是極度仁慈的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. And then there's some that have really taken a turn based on this hybrid program, and come to a little bit more of a balanced place.
→ {"text": "然後有些則是因為這個混種計畫真的轉了個彎,來到一個更加平衡的位置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

543. So you think initially, the ones before they engaged into this hybridization program, were maybe not as nice?
→ {"text": "所以你認為最初,在他們參與這個混種計畫之前,也許沒那麼友善?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

544. Well, there they're fifth dimensional beings, but they're negatively-oriented.
→ {"text": "嗯,他們是第五維度的存有,但他們是負面導向的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "fifth dimensional beings 對應 topics.json 術語"}

545. So they have all the technology.
→ {"text": "所以他們有所有的科技。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. They have of the genetic know-how.
→ {"text": "他們有基因方面的專業知識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. They have all of that.
→ {"text": "他們擁有所有這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. But they are negatively-oriented, and they're more hive mentality.
→ {"text": "但他們是負面導向的,而且他們更偏向蜂群心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "hive mentality 對應 topics.json 術語"}

549. And so at the beginning of the program, it was a lot more intense.
→ {"text": "所以在計畫一開始,情況要激烈得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. They didn't know how to work with humans because they genetically modified their emotions out of themselves.
→ {"text": "他們不知道如何與人類合作,因為他們把情感從自己身上基因改造掉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. But through this program, we sparked something in them that made them, to the best of their ability, understand more of the emotional body, and start to understand how to work with us in a way that doesn't completely freak us out.
→ {"text": "但透過這個計畫,我們在他們身上點燃了某種東西,讓他們盡其所能地更加理解情緒體,並開始理解如何以一種不會完全嚇壞我們的方式與我們合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

552. So probably the abductions that are happening now are less aggressive, a little more compassionate than maybe some of the abductions that were happening 10 or 20 years ago, in the early days.
→ {"text": "所以現在正在發生的綁架可能比較不激進,多一點慈悲,比起十年或二十年前、早期發生的那些綁架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "compassionate 使用術語表的「慈悲」"}

553. In the Benny and Barney Hill, the Whitney Strieber and some of these early records that we have of this happening.
→ {"text": "在 Benny and Barney Hill、Whitney Strieber 還有一些我們有的這類早期記錄中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Benny and Barney Hill、Whitney Strieber 為人名保留英文,對應 topics.json 術語"}


## Speaker Group 188

554. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

555. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

556. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

557. Are there still bad ones out there, you think?
→ {"text": "你覺得外面還有壞的嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

558. Yeah.
→ {"text": "有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

559. When we say bad?
→ {"text": "當我們說壞的時候?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. You know, I mean like ones that aren't as compassionate, I would say, like that.
→ {"text": "你知道,我是說像那種沒那麼有慈悲心的,就是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

561. And for the most part, most of the Zeta Reticuli have died off.
→ {"text": "而大部分的網罟座存有都已經死去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Zeta Reticuli 使用術語表的「網罟座」"}


## Speaker Group 195

562. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. That's why there was an urgency to do this, you know.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼做這件事有其迫切性,你知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. Because they couldn't reproduce.
→ {"text": "因為他們無法繁殖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. And so they needed a way to continue on, in a way that was continuing on with them, which is us, in a different way.
→ {"text": "所以他們需要一個方法來延續下去,以一種與他們一起延續的方式,也就是我們,以一種不同的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. So, yes.
→ {"text": "所以,是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

567. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. So we've got more than five, or around five races out there with humans kind of helping to seed that.
→ {"text": "所以外面有超過五個,或大約五個種族,是由人類幫助播種的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. What's the next steps?
→ {"text": "下一步是什麼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. Where do we go from here?
→ {"text": "我們接下來要往哪裡去?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

571. The next steps.
→ {"text": "下一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. The next steps are that there's many different possible timelines of what is going to happen.
→ {"text": "下一步是,有許多不同的可能時間線,關於將要發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. So then we get into more of the timeline metaphysical probability of someone's personal incarnational choice.
→ {"text": "所以接著我們會進入更多關於時間線的形上學機率,關於某人個人的轉世選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "metaphysical 使用術語表的「形上學的」;incarnational 使用術語表 incarnation 概念「轉世」"}

574. And through that, there's timelines.
→ {"text": "而透過那個,有時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. Because right now is when the Grays split off from human.
→ {"text": "因為現在正是灰人從人類分裂出去的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. This is like us right now, in the future, in a certain timeline became a Gray.
→ {"text": "這就像是我們現在,在未來,在某個時間線上變成了灰人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. Genetically modified ourselves, went underground in underground tunnels and, like, evolved in a certain way, with focus on the intellect versus emotion.
→ {"text": "基因改造了我們自己,在地下隧道裡轉入地下,然後以某種方式演化,著重於智力而非情感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

578. Did they say why they went to the underground tunnels?
→ {"text": "他們有說為什麼要去地下隧道嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

579. Well, because they started destroying the planet too much.
→ {"text": "嗯,因為他們開始過度破壞星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. But my personal opinion is that it's like the government underground scenario.
→ {"text": "但我個人的看法是,這就像政府地下設施的情境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. So it's kind of future government ended up becoming that.
→ {"text": "所以某種程度上是未來的政府最終變成了那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. It's my own kind of take on it.
→ {"text": "這是我自己的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

583. So Grays are humans?
→ {"text": "所以灰人是人類?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

584. Yeah, but just mutated humans from a different parallel reality Earth.
→ {"text": "對,但只是來自不同平行實相地球的變異人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "reality 使用術語表的「實相」"}

585. So it's not necessarily like this Earth, you know?
→ {"text": "所以不一定像這個地球,你知道嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

586. So if you go out to outer space, you end up bumping into Earth again?
→ {"text": "所以如果你出去外太空,最後又會碰到地球?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

587. Could be, in a future timeline.
→ {"text": "有可能,在未來的時間線上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. I mean, it's all so intertwined, you know?
→ {"text": "我是說,這一切都如此交織,你知道嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

589. It's kind of starting to make sense to me a little bit.
→ {"text": "這對我來說開始有點說得通了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. I'm seeing different things.
→ {"text": "我看到了不同的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. I'm hearing different things.
→ {"text": "我聽到了不同的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. But we'll let the audience decide if it makes sense to them or not.
→ {"text": "但我們讓觀眾決定這對他們來說有沒有道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. But I mean, that totally makes sense.
→ {"text": "但我是說,那完全說得通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. You know, you have the whole Denver airport big underground tunnel thing, with all the craziness and underground dulce.
→ {"text": "你知道,有整個丹佛機場的大型地下隧道的事,還有所有那些瘋狂的事和地下 Dulce 基地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Denver airport、Dulce 保留英文為地名"}

595. And you have all of this stuff, you know?
→ {"text": "而你有所有這些東西,你知道嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. And George Bush buying up all the mountains in Europe, and like building caves and caverns.
→ {"text": "還有 George Bush 買下歐洲所有的山,還有建造洞穴和岩洞之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "George Bush 人名保留英文"}

597. So I can see how humanity could have gone, or still, I guess, could go that direction.
→ {"text": "所以我能看出人類可能曾經走向,或者我猜仍然可能走向那個方向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

598. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. And then the other one, the other direction--
→ {"text": "然後另一個,另一個方向——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

600. The other direction--
→ {"text": "另一個方向——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
