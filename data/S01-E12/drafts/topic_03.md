## Speaker Group 37

158. So that led you into dabbling into healing others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. You said assisting others with alien abductions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

160. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. So that was one baby sliver of the two weeks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. And I thought it was crazy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. But at the same time, I was open, because I had to be open.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. That was my mission, was to be open, to understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

165. Open, meaning transparent, telling friends and family and the world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

166. Open in the way of like, I was open to believing it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. I was open to acknowledging that that was their experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

168. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Yeah, after you've had that experience, how could you not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

170. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. So I mean, it was a different segment, but it all fits into the same thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And a lot of people in the spiritual community don't translate over to extraterrestrials, sometimes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

174. A lot of extraterrestrial people don't translate into other realms and things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. Which is, for me, I found very hard to understand those people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. Because it's like, if it's one-- I mean, if you're going to let your brain leak out, you might as well just let it--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

177. Go all the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

178. --just go full.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. Full disclosure, full peanut butter, go all the way in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Might as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

181. I'm with you on all of that, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

182. Because when you throw out all scientific logic, for one thing, why not throw it out for the other stuff?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

183. You've got to be open to throwing everything out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. And it just spins and spirals.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. But the abduction thing was the last thing I was going to throw out. Which you'd think for a lot of people, it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

186. So that's meaning the hardest thing for you to--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

187. Acknowledge.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

188. --acknowledge that that's the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

189. Yes. >> So ghost, you've got that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

190. Ghost, past lives, good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. Angels, great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. Fairies, awesome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. Aliens, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

194. Mermaids?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

195. Yes!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

196. Yes on mermaids before alien abductions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

197. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

198. Wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. OK, never mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. That's good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

201. I really like mermaids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

202. I figured you would, that's why I brought it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. So then, aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

204. So, aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

205. Aliens, in essence, aliens or alien abductions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. Was it the abduction phenomenon?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

207. Abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. I was fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. See, yet again, it's like star family is OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. Alien abductions isn't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. And it's nice having had my own belief dot disconnect, because now I can see where it is for other people, which is just programming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. So in another part of the training, we had talked about star beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. It's like, oh, you have other lives from Sirius and Pleiades.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. And I was good with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. I'm like, that sounds really cool.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. I'm into that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. And then it's like, alien abduction?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. So I definitely had a disconnect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. But then as I started doing this and working with these different clients, I would have almost all of them were abductees.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. And then I contacted the different people that I was trained with--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

222. Male and female?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. Or was it--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

224. Male and female.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. And I contacted the other women I was trained with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. And I said, are you getting abductees?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. And they were like, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. Like, uh, why am I getting all the abductees, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. I didn't want to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. There was nothing in my, like, ego or anything that wanted to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. But it was resonance for some reason.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. So you were working with these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. What did you call yourself, I guess?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. A spiritual healer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. Or did you have a business card?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

237. I had a business card.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. I was a healer, I guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. So I was a healer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. I did different shamanic work, trauma release, different stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. And then, more of the metaphysical things too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. So it was just like the full spectrum of whatever was needed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

243. OK, gotcha.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

244. So I was healer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

245. And then you had other, I guess, coworkers, co-healers, that were also using the same modalities to help other people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. And that was colleagues that you could consult with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

247. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

248. Got it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

249. Yeah, and none of them had had this--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

250. And none of them had had an abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

251. None of them were getting abducted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

252. But had they heard of the abduction phenomenon prior?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

253. Yeah, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

254. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. And you had heard of it, too, from movies?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

256. Well, that, and it was part of the healing training.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

257. Oh, it was?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

258. Yeah, just like a small segment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. So it was acknowledged.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. And there was a checking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. It was kind of like a checklist of what could be out of alignment, or what could be the origin of discomfort or trauma.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. And right there is, like, implants, like alien abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. And so I'd have to go through it every time, and every time that came up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. So I thought, hmm, it's coming up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. I need to look at this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. And so I did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

267. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. In what way?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

269. In the way that, well, my dad was simultaneously in the conspiracy avenue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. And he was like, there are aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. There's evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. There's science.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. And I'm on this metaphysical, like, healing side, being like, there's people saying they're abducted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

274. The government's covering it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. It's a big thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Yeah, I've been down that path.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

277. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. But it was good, because there was the science evidence aspect, and then there was me, like, having the experiential situations going on with these clients.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. So we were like comparing and contrasting notes, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. He would be like, well I watched this abduction video where they were taking eggs and semen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. And then the person would be like, yeah, I saw myself on the table.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. And so I had no context.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. And it was just what these people were telling me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. And so it was two worlds kind of converging to support this new idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

285. About how long ago was this, I guess, in day and age?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

286. I guess, this was about four years ago, four or five years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

287. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

288. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

289. So enough information is out there, or had been out there at that time, to kind of put the puzzle pieces together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. And you had different aspects of the puzzle pieces, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. So what happened after that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. How did you help these people who claim to have abductions and implants too?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Did they claim to have implants?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

294. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

295. So how would you go about helping them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

296. Well, we were told the greater story of the Zetas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

297. From..?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

298. From the woman that was putting this on, she had that perspective via Lisa Royal and different people that she had studied.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. So there was the Zeta--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

300. The woman who trained you in the healing modalities?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

302. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. So you actually got kind of a certification from her and stuff?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

304. Uh-huh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

305. OK, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

306. And so she had this perspective of going, OK the Grays were this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. And they didn't have emotion, so there was this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. And then it caused trauma in people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. So we kind of had the objective perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. I went at it more from a trauma perspective, rather than trying to cope with the idea of aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. It was like, OK this was a trauma.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. And it kind of feels like maybe a sexual trauma.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. So like, how can we look at that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. And part of it, in any kind of healing modality, is just acknowledgment, just for it to be spoken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. And then that energy is like released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. And so that was probably like the biggest first step.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. And I wouldn't go into it too much at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. I went into more of the other avenues that were up, but just acknowledging it and going through it in the session was what I did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

319. And by just bringing that up and acknowledging it, did you see a transformation in the people that you're working with?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

320. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

321. Would they have memories that they would recall?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

322. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

323. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. What was that like?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

325. I mean, it was interesting, because as you know with the abductees, it's like, it's someone's personal experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. And that is powerful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

327. And a lot of times, our sexual organs and our body parts are very personal to us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. So when those areas get violated, it hits home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

329. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

330. Yeah, absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

331. And so for me, it was just, like, compassion and going, whoa.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. It just solidified that reality for them-- because it wasn't my reality-- was real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. And so it just brought that to a deeper place in me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

334. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

335. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

336. And you worked with enough people to verify that they weren't making it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

337. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. And that's the thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. No one wants to make up that they were abducted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. I don't think that this is like said enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. There's no catalyst of popularity that is gonna come from saying that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

342. I agree.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. I've spoken to-- I think I mentioned earlier, I've spoken to probably over 100 contactees.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. Mix match, some abductees, experiencers, contactees, there's whole subcategories of that whole batch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. It's very hard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Even government people who have high level positions and have everything in the world to lose by saying something like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. And they're very brave, I think, the ones that do come forward and speak of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. And they're very reluctant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. A lot of them that have kept secrets for 20, 30, 40, 50 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

350. So you said until that time, you hadn't associated it with a personal experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Then what happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

352. Then, I had to honor the fear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. Because I was like OK well, I might not have personal experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. But am I fearful of this idea, of ETs coming and taking me out of my bed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Yeah, sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. It was a hypothetical situation, still.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. And then I watched "The Fourth Kind".
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. And "The Fourth Kind" changed it all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

359. In a positive, negative way?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

360. Surprisingly, a positive way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. Because the show completely freaked me out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. So you would think that it would have repelled me even farther from looking at it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. But I'm strange.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. And so then after watching it, I knew about the idea of hybrid children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. And so then I went to my room and I just asked, like with my full openness, like full heart-- I will go down whatever road this leads me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Do I have hybrid children?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. And well actually before that, it was through the healing stuff, it showed that you could be abducted in another life that was, like, kind of simultaneous to now, as well as this life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. And so I asked first, do I have hybrid kids from another life?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. Still kind of like pushing it away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

370. Without asking the question directly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

371. And then I was just like..
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

372. Who would you ask?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. Is this like a prayer to God?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

374. That's a good question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

375. --or the universe?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. Because a lot of people have different labels for their belief system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. So I'm just curious in how would you present that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

378. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. So by that time for me, I had a pretty clear attunement to many streams of different beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. So I mean, I'm like, I had a very clear awareness of what an angel felt like, or what a guide felt like, or what an ancestor felt like, these different frequencies of asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. And within the healing work that I did, it was all about creating a real visceral experience of your inter-dimensional support team that you have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. So like everyone has guardian angels.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. Everyone has guides.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

384. When you say inter-dimensional, that could also be extra-dimensional?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

385. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

386. So just these otherworldly beings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

387. Otherworldy beings, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. And so I cultivated that really strong communication conduit to my own guidance system, as well as my higher self.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. So it would be my guidance system and my higher self that I'd be asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. And probably for this question, I was probably asking Source itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Like, all right, let's have it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

392. All of you guides, and the big cheese.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

393. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. Is this the case?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

395. And what was your answer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

396. The biggest yes I have ever received.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. Like, it just hit me so hard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. And I just started bawling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. And it opened this emotional conduit in me that I don't think I had had this emotional an experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

400. And up until this, you hadn't had any conscious sightings or lost time or abduction-type things?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

401. Not that I remembered.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. The only thing that was sticky that I could kind of look back to was when I was, I kept on having this really strong feeling that I was pregnant, a lot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. And I was a virgin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. And so that stuck with me my whole life, because I would always say it to my mom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. And she would say that I was strange.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. And really, like no, you're not pregnant!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. So that stuck.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. That was, like, there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

409. So that was always there, even before you asked the question?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. It was a little kind of, that was strange.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

411. That was strange.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. And looking back on it now, I mean, a lot of different memories have come back up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. But another thing that is strange that I haven't even put together really, until this past year, is from about age 8 to age 12, I would create these really large families of paper dolls-- like children and parents of all different shapes and sizes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. And my cousin and I would create little videos of these families in these different scenarios.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. And just the way that we did it was not just like playing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Like, there was some kind of an intimate relationship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. And there were way too many kids and certain style that both of us were coming from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. It was very odd and interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. So I feel like that was remembrance and a bringing through of things I had seen on the ship that was coming through.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

420. So you asked the question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. You got a big knock on the head, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. Immediately, did memories and visions start pulling through of experiences?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. Or how did you start to come to that realization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. What was the validation, I guess?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. If you got a yes, I'm sure there had to be some sort of validation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

426. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. The validation-- I guess this is almost an answer to your question-- but was I could hear them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

428. Could hear the kids?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

429. So the yes was from the kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. And I could hear them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. And it was a portal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. And it was an energy stream from certain beings that I had never heard from before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. And so the full building of the spectrum of all the beings that I was connected to, validated like my communication and my confidence with these certain beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. So by the time these kids started talking, I'm going, that's a new branch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. Like, this is a new energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. This is a new thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. And so that was validating based on all the other things that had built up my confidence in this healing extrasensory arena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

438. So what happened next?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. I mean, after that, you got the hit in the head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

440. After that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

441. Then you started hearing these voices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. Did you communicate back with them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Did you have conversations?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

444. For the next probably five months, I had to sleep on it for five months, pretty much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. I knew that it was true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. But I was not ready to go forward or do anything with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Like it was just sitting, kind of like dormant, waiting to like burst to another level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. So I just kind of sat with it and let it digest for that long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

449. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. Did you sit on it with more downloads, or no?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

451. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. No, I just sat with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

453. Didn't ask any more questions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

454. I didn't ask.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. That was the only question that needed to be asked at that moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

456. Yeah, gotcha.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
