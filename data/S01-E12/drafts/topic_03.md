## Speaker Group 37

158. So that led you into dabbling into healing others.
→ {"text": "所以這讓你開始涉足療癒他人的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. You said assisting others with alien abductions?
→ {"text": "你說協助那些遭遇外星綁架的人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

160. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. So that was one baby sliver of the two weeks.
→ {"text": "那只是那兩週課程中的一小部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. And I thought it was crazy.
→ {"text": "我當時覺得這太瘋狂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. But at the same time, I was open, because I had to be open.
→ {"text": "但同時，我是開放的，因為我必須保持開放。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. That was my mission, was to be open, to understand.
→ {"text": "那是我的使命，保持開放，去理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

165. Open, meaning transparent, telling friends and family and the world?
→ {"text": "開放的意思是，對朋友、家人和全世界坦白透明？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

166. Open in the way of like, I was open to believing it.
→ {"text": "我說的開放是指，我願意去相信它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. I was open to acknowledging that that was their experience.
→ {"text": "我願意承認那是他們的真實經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

168. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Yeah, after you've had that experience, how could you not?
→ {"text": "對啊，在你經歷過那樣的體驗之後，怎麼可能不相信呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

170. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. So I mean, it was a different segment, but it all fits into the same thing.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，雖然這是不同的領域，但它們其實都歸屬於同一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. And a lot of people in the spiritual community don't translate over to extraterrestrials, sometimes.
→ {"text": "有些靈性社群的人，有時候無法接受外星生命的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "spiritual 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「靈性的」"}


## Speaker Group 43

174. A lot of extraterrestrial people don't translate into other realms and things.
→ {"text": "同樣地，很多相信外星人的人也無法接受其他維度或靈性領域的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. Which is, for me, I found very hard to understand those people.
→ {"text": "對我來說，我很難理解這些人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. Because it's like, if it's one-- I mean, if you're going to let your brain leak out, you might as well just let it--
→ {"text": "因為就像是，如果你都已經準備好打破常規思維了，那不如就乾脆——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

177. Go all the way.
→ {"text": "一路走到底。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

178. --just go full.
→ {"text": "就全盤接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. Full disclosure, full peanut butter, go all the way in.
→ {"text": "完全敞開，完全投入，一路走到底。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Might as well.
→ {"text": "反正都到這一步了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

181. I'm with you on all of that, yeah.
→ {"text": "我完全同意你說的這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

182. Because when you throw out all scientific logic, for one thing, why not throw it out for the other stuff?
→ {"text": "因為既然你都能為了一件事拋開所有科學邏輯，為什麼不能為其他事情也拋開呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

183. You've got to be open to throwing everything out.
→ {"text": "你必須願意拋開一切固有觀念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. And it just spins and spirals.
→ {"text": "而這會不斷延伸、不斷擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. But the abduction thing was the last thing I was going to throw out. Which you'd think for a lot of people, it is.
→ {"text": "但外星綁架這件事，是我最後才願意接受的。你可能會覺得對很多人來說，這確實是最難接受的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

186. So that's meaning the hardest thing for you to--
→ {"text": "所以意思是說，這對你來說是最難", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

187. Acknowledge.
→ {"text": "承認的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

188. --acknowledge that that's the truth.
→ {"text": "承認這是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

189. Yes. >> So ghost, you've got that.
→ {"text": "對。那麼鬼魂，你是接受的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ">> 表示說話者轉換"}


## Speaker Group 53

190. Ghost, past lives, good.
→ {"text": "鬼魂、前世，沒問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. Angels, great.
→ {"text": "天使，很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. Fairies, awesome.
→ {"text": "精靈，很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. Aliens, no.
→ {"text": "外星人，不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

194. Mermaids?
→ {"text": "美人魚呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

195. Yes!
→ {"text": "可以！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

196. Yes on mermaids before alien abductions.
→ {"text": "美人魚都能接受，外星綁架卻不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

197. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

198. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. OK, never mind.
→ {"text": "好吧，算了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. That's good.
→ {"text": "這很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

201. I really like mermaids.
→ {"text": "我真的很喜歡美人魚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

202. I figured you would, that's why I brought it up.
→ {"text": "我猜你會喜歡，所以才提起這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. So then, aliens.
→ {"text": "那麼，外星人呢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

204. So, aliens.
→ {"text": "所以，外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

205. Aliens, in essence, aliens or alien abductions?
→ {"text": "外星人，本質上是說外星人本身，還是外星綁架？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. Was it the abduction phenomenon?
→ {"text": "是綁架現象嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

207. Abduction.
→ {"text": "綁架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. I was fine.
→ {"text": "我沒問題的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. See, yet again, it's like star family is OK.
→ {"text": "你看，又是這樣，星際家族我能接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "star family 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「星際家族」"}

210. Alien abductions isn't.
→ {"text": "外星綁架卻不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. And it's nice having had my own belief dot disconnect, because now I can see where it is for other people, which is just programming.
→ {"text": "而且很慶幸我自己也經歷過這種信念上的斷點，因為現在我能看出別人的斷點在哪裡，那其實只是既定的思維模式。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "belief dot disconnect 意指信念系統中的不連貫處，譯為「信念上的斷點」"}

212. So in another part of the training, we had talked about star beings.
→ {"text": "在訓練課程的另一部分，我們談到了星際存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "star beings 意指來自其他星系的存有"}

213. It's like, oh, you have other lives from Sirius and Pleiades.
→ {"text": "像是說，你有來自天狼星和昴宿星團的其他生命經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Sirius 天狼星、Pleiades 昴宿星團為常見天文譯名"}

214. And I was good with that.
→ {"text": "這我能接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. I'm like, that sounds really cool.
→ {"text": "我覺得，這聽起來很酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. I'm into that.
→ {"text": "我喜歡這個概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. And then it's like, alien abduction?
→ {"text": "然後換成外星綁架？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. No.
→ {"text": "不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. So I definitely had a disconnect.
→ {"text": "所以我確實有這樣的斷點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. But then as I started doing this and working with these different clients, I would have almost all of them were abductees.
→ {"text": "但當我開始從事這份工作、接觸不同的客戶後，我發現幾乎所有來找我的人都是被綁架者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. And then I contacted the different people that I was trained with--
→ {"text": "然後我聯絡了一起受訓的其他人", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

222. Male and female?
→ {"text": "男性和女性都有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Or was it--
→ {"text": "還是", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

224. Male and female.
→ {"text": "男性和女性都有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. And I contacted the other women I was trained with.
→ {"text": "我聯絡了一起受訓的其他女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. And I said, are you getting abductees?
→ {"text": "我問她們，你們也遇過被綁架者嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. And they were like, no.
→ {"text": "她們說，沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. Like, uh, why am I getting all the abductees, you know?
→ {"text": "我就想，為什麼所有被綁架者都來找我呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. I didn't want to.
→ {"text": "我並不想這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. There was nothing in my, like, ego or anything that wanted to.
→ {"text": "我的小我或任何部分都沒有想要這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ego 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「小我」"}

232. But it was resonance for some reason.
→ {"text": "但不知為何，就是有這種共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. So you were working with these people.
→ {"text": "所以你在為這些人工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. What did you call yourself, I guess?
→ {"text": "那你怎麼稱呼自己呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. A spiritual healer?
→ {"text": "靈性療癒師？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "spiritual 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「靈性的」；healing 譯為「療癒」"}

236. Or did you have a business card?
→ {"text": "還是說你有名片？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

237. I had a business card.
→ {"text": "我有名片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. I was a healer, I guess.
→ {"text": "我算是個療癒師吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. So I was a healer.
→ {"text": "所以我是療癒師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. I did different shamanic work, trauma release, different stuff.
→ {"text": "我做各種薩滿工作、創傷釋放，各式各樣的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. And then, more of the metaphysical things too.
→ {"text": "還有更多形上學方面的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "metaphysical 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「形上學的」"}

242. So it was just like the full spectrum of whatever was needed.
→ {"text": "所以就是根據需要，提供全方位的服務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

243. OK, gotcha.
→ {"text": "好，了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

244. So I was healer.
→ {"text": "所以我是療癒師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

245. And then you had other, I guess, coworkers, co-healers, that were also using the same modalities to help other people.
→ {"text": "然後你還有其他同事，或說同為療癒師的人，也是用相同的方法幫助他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. And that was colleagues that you could consult with.
→ {"text": "他們是你可以諮詢的同儕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

247. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

248. Got it.
→ {"text": "了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

249. Yeah, and none of them had had this--
→ {"text": "是的，她們都沒有遇到這種", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

250. And none of them had had an abduction.
→ {"text": "她們都沒有遇到綁架案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

251. None of them were getting abducted.
→ {"text": "她們都沒有接觸被綁架者的個案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

252. But had they heard of the abduction phenomenon prior?
→ {"text": "但她們之前聽過綁架現象嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

253. Yeah, yeah.
→ {"text": "有聽過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

254. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. And you had heard of it, too, from movies?
→ {"text": "那你也是從電影中聽說的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

256. Well, that, and it was part of the healing training.
→ {"text": "那是一方面，另外療癒訓練課程中也有提到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

257. Oh, it was?
→ {"text": "喔，有嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

258. Yeah, just like a small segment.
→ {"text": "有，只是很小的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. So it was acknowledged.
→ {"text": "所以這是被承認的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. And there was a checking.
→ {"text": "而且有個檢查程序。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. It was kind of like a checklist of what could be out of alignment, or what could be the origin of discomfort or trauma.
→ {"text": "就像是一個清單，列出什麼可能失調、或什麼可能是不適或創傷的源頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "alignment 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「對齊」，out of alignment 即「失調」"}

262. And right there is, like, implants, like alien abduction.
→ {"text": "清單上就有像是植入物、外星綁架這類項目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "implants 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「植入物」"}

263. And so I'd have to go through it every time, and every time that came up.
→ {"text": "所以每次我都得檢查一遍，而每次都會出現這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. So I thought, hmm, it's coming up.
→ {"text": "所以我想，嗯，它一直出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. I need to look at this.
→ {"text": "我需要仔細看看這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. And so I did.
→ {"text": "於是我就這麼做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

267. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. In what way?
→ {"text": "怎麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

269. In the way that, well, my dad was simultaneously in the conspiracy avenue.
→ {"text": "是這樣的，我父親當時同時在陰謀論那條路上探索。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. And he was like, there are aliens.
→ {"text": "他說，外星人是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. There's evidence.
→ {"text": "有證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. There's science.
→ {"text": "有科學依據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. And I'm on this metaphysical, like, healing side, being like, there's people saying they're abducted.
→ {"text": "而我在形上學的療癒這一邊，聽到有人說他們被綁架了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

274. The government's covering it up.
→ {"text": "政府在掩蓋真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. It's a big thing.
→ {"text": "這是大事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. Yeah, I've been down that path.
→ {"text": "是啊，我也走過那條路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

277. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. But it was good, because there was the science evidence aspect, and then there was me, like, having the experiential situations going on with these clients.
→ {"text": "但這很好，因為一邊有科學證據的面向，另一邊有我從客戶那裡獲得的實際經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. So we were like comparing and contrasting notes, you know?
→ {"text": "所以我們就像在比對筆記一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. He would be like, well I watched this abduction video where they were taking eggs and semen.
→ {"text": "他會說，我看了這個綁架影片，裡面他們在取卵子和精子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. And then the person would be like, yeah, I saw myself on the table.
→ {"text": "然後我的客戶會說，對，我看到自己在手術台上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. And so I had no context.
→ {"text": "而我之前完全沒有這方面的背景知識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. And it was just what these people were telling me.
→ {"text": "這只是這些人告訴我的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. And so it was two worlds kind of converging to support this new idea.
→ {"text": "所以這是兩個世界的交會，共同支持著這個新概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

285. About how long ago was this, I guess, in day and age?
→ {"text": "這大概是多久以前的事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

286. I guess, this was about four years ago, four or five years ago.
→ {"text": "我想想，這大概是四年前，四、五年前的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

287. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

288. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

289. So enough information is out there, or had been out there at that time, to kind of put the puzzle pieces together.
→ {"text": "所以當時已經有足夠的資訊可以把這些拼圖拼起來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. And you had different aspects of the puzzle pieces, I see.
→ {"text": "而你們有不同面向的拼圖碎片，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. So what happened after that?
→ {"text": "那之後發生了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. How did you help these people who claim to have abductions and implants too?
→ {"text": "你怎麼幫助這些聲稱被綁架、還有植入物的人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Did they claim to have implants?
→ {"text": "他們有說自己有植入物嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

294. Yeah.
→ {"text": "有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

295. So how would you go about helping them?
→ {"text": "那你會怎麼幫助他們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

296. Well, we were told the greater story of the Zetas.
→ {"text": "我們被告知了網罟座族群的更大故事背景。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Zetas 即 Zeta Reticuli，依 terminology.yaml 譯為「網罟座」"}


## Speaker Group 93

297. From..?
→ {"text": "從誰那裡聽說的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

298. From the woman that was putting this on, she had that perspective via Lisa Royal and different people that she had studied.
→ {"text": "從舉辦這個課程的女士那裡，她透過 Lisa Royal 和她研究過的其他人獲得這個觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Lisa Royal 為人名，保留英文"}

299. So there was the Zeta--
→ {"text": "所以有網罟座", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

300. The woman who trained you in the healing modalities?
→ {"text": "就是那位訓練你療癒方法的女士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

302. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. So you actually got kind of a certification from her and stuff?
→ {"text": "所以你實際上從她那裡獲得某種認證之類的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

304. Uh-huh.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

305. OK, I see.
→ {"text": "好，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

306. And so she had this perspective of going, OK the Grays were this.
→ {"text": "所以她有這樣的觀點，就是說灰人是這樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Grays 為外星種族名稱，譯為「灰人」"}

307. And they didn't have emotion, so there was this.
→ {"text": "他們沒有情感，所以有這樣的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. And then it caused trauma in people.
→ {"text": "然後這對人們造成了創傷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. So we kind of had the objective perspective.
→ {"text": "所以我們有了一個客觀的視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. I went at it more from a trauma perspective, rather than trying to cope with the idea of aliens.
→ {"text": "我更多是從創傷的角度切入，而不是試圖去應對外星人的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. It was like, OK this was a trauma.
→ {"text": "就像是說，好，這是一個創傷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. And it kind of feels like maybe a sexual trauma.
→ {"text": "感覺起來有點像是性創傷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. So like, how can we look at that?
→ {"text": "那麼我們可以怎麼看待這件事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. And part of it, in any kind of healing modality, is just acknowledgment, just for it to be spoken.
→ {"text": "而在任何療癒方法中，部分過程就是承認，就是把它說出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. And then that energy is like released.
→ {"text": "然後那個能量就像被釋放了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "energy 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「能量」"}

316. And so that was probably like the biggest first step.
→ {"text": "所以這大概是最重要的第一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. And I wouldn't go into it too much at that time.
→ {"text": "那時候我不會深入太多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. I went into more of the other avenues that were up, but just acknowledging it and going through it in the session was what I did.
→ {"text": "我會更多地處理其他浮現的議題，但在療程中承認並處理這件事，就是我的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

319. And by just bringing that up and acknowledging it, did you see a transformation in the people that you're working with?
→ {"text": "那麼只是提起並承認這件事，你有看到與你共事的人們產生轉變嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

320. Yeah.
→ {"text": "有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

321. Would they have memories that they would recall?
→ {"text": "他們會回想起記憶嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

322. Yeah.
→ {"text": "會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

323. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. What was that like?
→ {"text": "那是什麼樣的情況？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

325. I mean, it was interesting, because as you know with the abductees, it's like, it's someone's personal experience.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，這很有趣，因為就像你知道的，對於被綁架者來說，這是某人的個人經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. And that is powerful.
→ {"text": "而這是很有力量的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

327. And a lot of times, our sexual organs and our body parts are very personal to us.
→ {"text": "很多時候，我們的性器官和身體部位對我們來說是非常私密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. So when those areas get violated, it hits home.
→ {"text": "所以當這些部位被侵犯時，會深深觸動內心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

329. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

330. Yeah, absolutely.
→ {"text": "是的，完全是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

331. And so for me, it was just, like, compassion and going, whoa.
→ {"text": "所以對我來說，就是懷著慈悲心，然後心想，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "compassion 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「慈悲」"}

332. It just solidified that reality for them-- because it wasn't my reality-- was real.
→ {"text": "這確立了他們的那個實相是真的，因為那不曾是我的實相體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "reality 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「實相」"}

333. And so it just brought that to a deeper place in me.
→ {"text": "所以這讓我內心對此有了更深層的理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

334. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

335. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

336. And you worked with enough people to verify that they weren't making it up.
→ {"text": "而且你與足夠多的人共事，可以確認他們不是編造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

337. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. And that's the thing.
→ {"text": "而且重點在於。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. No one wants to make up that they were abducted.
→ {"text": "沒有人想要編造自己被綁架的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. I don't think that this is like said enough.
→ {"text": "我覺得這一點沒有被充分強調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. There's no catalyst of popularity that is gonna come from saying that.
→ {"text": "說出這種事不會帶來任何讓你受歡迎的動力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

342. I agree.
→ {"text": "我同意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. I've spoken to-- I think I mentioned earlier, I've spoken to probably over 100 contactees.
→ {"text": "我想我之前提過，我大概和超過 100 位接觸者交談過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. Mix match, some abductees, experiencers, contactees, there's whole subcategories of that whole batch.
→ {"text": "是一個大雜燴，有些是被綁架者、經歷者、接觸者，這整批人裡有各種子類別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. It's very hard.
→ {"text": "這非常困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. Even government people who have high level positions and have everything in the world to lose by saying something like that.
→ {"text": "甚至是政府高層人士，說出這種話會讓他們失去世上的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. And they're very brave, I think, the ones that do come forward and speak of it.
→ {"text": "我認為那些站出來說出這些事的人非常勇敢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. And they're very reluctant.
→ {"text": "他們都非常猶豫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. A lot of them that have kept secrets for 20, 30, 40, 50 years old.
→ {"text": "他們當中很多人保守秘密長達 20、30、40、50 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

350. So you said until that time, you hadn't associated it with a personal experience.
→ {"text": "所以你說在那之前，你沒有把它與個人經歷聯繫起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. Then what happened?
→ {"text": "那麼後來發生了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

352. Then, I had to honor the fear.
→ {"text": "然後，我必須正視那份恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. Because I was like OK well, I might not have personal experience.
→ {"text": "因為我想，好吧，我可能沒有親身經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. But am I fearful of this idea, of ETs coming and taking me out of my bed?
→ {"text": "但我害怕這個概念嗎？外星人來把我從床上帶走？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Yeah, sure.
→ {"text": "是的，當然會怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. It was a hypothetical situation, still.
→ {"text": "這還只是個假設情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. And then I watched "The Fourth Kind".
→ {"text": "然後我看了《第四類接觸》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "The Fourth Kind 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「第四類接觸」"}

358. And "The Fourth Kind" changed it all.
→ {"text": "《第四類接觸》改變了一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

359. In a positive, negative way?
→ {"text": "是正面的還是負面的改變？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

360. Surprisingly, a positive way.
→ {"text": "令人驚訝的是，是正面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. Because the show completely freaked me out.
→ {"text": "因為那部片完全嚇到我了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. So you would think that it would have repelled me even farther from looking at it.
→ {"text": "你可能以為這會讓我更加排斥去看待這個議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. But I'm strange.
→ {"text": "但我很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. And so then after watching it, I knew about the idea of hybrid children.
→ {"text": "看完影片之後，我知道了混種孩子的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "hybrid 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「混種」"}

365. And so then I went to my room and I just asked, like with my full openness, like full heart-- I will go down whatever road this leads me.
→ {"text": "所以我回到房間，然後我就問了，帶著完全的開放，全心全意，無論這引領我走向哪條路，我都願意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Do I have hybrid children?
→ {"text": "我有混種孩子嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. And well actually before that, it was through the healing stuff, it showed that you could be abducted in another life that was, like, kind of simultaneous to now, as well as this life.
→ {"text": "實際上在那之前，是透過療癒的內容，顯示你可能在另一個與現在共存的平行時空中被綁架，也可能是在這一生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. And so I asked first, do I have hybrid kids from another life?
→ {"text": "所以我先問，我有來自另一生的混種孩子嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. Still kind of like pushing it away.
→ {"text": "還是有點在迴避。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

370. Without asking the question directly.
→ {"text": "沒有直接問這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

371. And then I was just like..
→ {"text": "然後我就...", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

372. Who would you ask?
→ {"text": "你會問誰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. Is this like a prayer to God?
→ {"text": "這像是向上帝禱告嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

374. That's a good question.
→ {"text": "這是個好問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

375. --or the universe?
→ {"text": "還是向宇宙？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. Because a lot of people have different labels for their belief system.
→ {"text": "因為很多人對他們的信仰系統有不同的稱呼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. So I'm just curious in how would you present that.
→ {"text": "所以我只是好奇你會怎麼表達這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

378. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. So by that time for me, I had a pretty clear attunement to many streams of different beings.
→ {"text": "所以對我來說，到那個時候，我已經對許多不同存有的類別有了相當清晰的調頻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "beings 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「存有」"}

380. So I mean, I'm like, I had a very clear awareness of what an angel felt like, or what a guide felt like, or what an ancestor felt like, these different frequencies of asking.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我對天使的感覺、指導靈的感覺、祖先的感覺，這些不同的詢問頻率，都有非常清晰的覺察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "guides 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「指導靈」"}

381. And within the healing work that I did, it was all about creating a real visceral experience of your inter-dimensional support team that you have.
→ {"text": "而在我從事的療癒工作中，一切都是關於創造你擁有的跨維度支持團隊的真實、深刻的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. So like everyone has guardian angels.
→ {"text": "就像每個人都有守護天使。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. Everyone has guides.
→ {"text": "每個人都有指導靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

384. When you say inter-dimensional, that could also be extra-dimensional?
→ {"text": "當你說跨維度時，這也可以是超維度的意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

385. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

386. So just these otherworldly beings?
→ {"text": "所以就是這些來自其他世界的存有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

387. Otherworldy beings, yeah.
→ {"text": "來自其他世界的存有，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. And so I cultivated that really strong communication conduit to my own guidance system, as well as my higher self.
→ {"text": "所以我培養出與我自己的指引系統、以及我的高我之間非常強大的通訊媒介。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "conduit 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「媒介」；higher self 譯為「高我」"}

389. So it would be my guidance system and my higher self that I'd be asking.
→ {"text": "所以我會詢問的是我的指引系統和我的高我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. And probably for this question, I was probably asking Source itself.
→ {"text": "而對於這個問題，我大概是在詢問源頭本身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Source 在靈性語境中通常譯為「源頭」"}

391. Like, all right, let's have it.
→ {"text": "就像是，好吧，讓我知道吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

392. All of you guides, and the big cheese.
→ {"text": "你們所有的指導靈，還有大老闆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "big cheese 口語化表達指「最高層」或「大老闆」"}


## Speaker Group 131

393. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. Is this the case?
→ {"text": "是這樣嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

395. And what was your answer?
→ {"text": "那你得到的答案是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

396. The biggest yes I have ever received.
→ {"text": "我這輩子收到過最強烈的肯定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. Like, it just hit me so hard.
→ {"text": "就像，它重重地擊中了我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. And I just started bawling.
→ {"text": "然後我就開始大哭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. And it opened this emotional conduit in me that I don't think I had had this emotional an experience.
→ {"text": "它在我體內打開了這個情感媒介，我不認為我曾經有過如此深刻的情感體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "conduit 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「媒介」"}


## Speaker Group 134

400. And up until this, you hadn't had any conscious sightings or lost time or abduction-type things?
→ {"text": "而在此之前，你沒有任何有意識的目擊、失去時間或類似被綁架的事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

401. Not that I remembered.
→ {"text": "沒有，就我記得的沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. The only thing that was sticky that I could kind of look back to was when I was, I kept on having this really strong feeling that I was pregnant, a lot.
→ {"text": "唯一讓我印象深刻、可以回顧的是，我一直有這種非常強烈的感覺，覺得自己懷孕了，經常有這種感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. And I was a virgin.
→ {"text": "而我當時還是處女。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. And so that stuck with me my whole life, because I would always say it to my mom.
→ {"text": "所以這件事一直伴隨著我的一生，因為我總是會跟我媽說這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. And she would say that I was strange.
→ {"text": "她會說我很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. And really, like no, you're not pregnant!
→ {"text": "然後很認真地說，不，你沒有懷孕！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. So that stuck.
→ {"text": "所以這個印象很深刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. That was, like, there.
→ {"text": "就一直在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

409. So that was always there, even before you asked the question?
→ {"text": "所以這一直都在，甚至在你問那個問題之前？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. It was a little kind of, that was strange.
→ {"text": "有點，那很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

411. That was strange.
→ {"text": "那確實很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. And looking back on it now, I mean, a lot of different memories have come back up.
→ {"text": "現在回顧起來，我是說，很多不同的記憶都浮現回來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. But another thing that is strange that I haven't even put together really, until this past year, is from about age 8 to age 12, I would create these really large families of paper dolls-- like children and parents of all different shapes and sizes.
→ {"text": "但另一件奇怪的事，直到去年我才真正把它串連起來，就是從大約 8 歲到 12 歲，我會創造這些非常龐大的紙娃娃家庭——各種不同形狀和大小的孩子和父母。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. And my cousin and I would create little videos of these families in these different scenarios.
→ {"text": "我和我表妹會為這些家庭在不同情境中創作小影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. And just the way that we did it was not just like playing.
→ {"text": "而我們做這件事的方式不只是像在玩耍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. Like, there was some kind of an intimate relationship.
→ {"text": "就像是，有某種親密的關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. And there were way too many kids and certain style that both of us were coming from.
→ {"text": "而且孩子的數量太多了，我們倆都有某種特定的風格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. It was very odd and interesting.
→ {"text": "這非常奇怪又有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. So I feel like that was remembrance and a bringing through of things I had seen on the ship that was coming through.
→ {"text": "所以我覺得那是一種記憶，是把我在飛船上看到的東西帶到現實中來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

420. So you asked the question.
→ {"text": "所以你問了這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. You got a big knock on the head, yes.
→ {"text": "你得到了一記重擊，一個肯定的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. Immediately, did memories and visions start pulling through of experiences?
→ {"text": "立刻就有記憶和異象開始浮現嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. Or how did you start to come to that realization?
→ {"text": "或者你是怎麼開始意識到這件事的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. What was the validation, I guess?
→ {"text": "我想問的是，驗證是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. If you got a yes, I'm sure there had to be some sort of validation.
→ {"text": "如果你得到了肯定的答案，我相信一定有某種驗證。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

426. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. The validation-- I guess this is almost an answer to your question-- but was I could hear them.
→ {"text": "驗證是，我想這幾乎就是你問題的答案，我能聽到他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

428. Could hear the kids?
→ {"text": "能聽到孩子們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

429. So the yes was from the kids.
→ {"text": "所以那個肯定答案是來自孩子們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. And I could hear them.
→ {"text": "而我能聽到他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. And it was a portal.
→ {"text": "那是一個入口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. And it was an energy stream from certain beings that I had never heard from before.
→ {"text": "那是來自某些我以前從未聽過的存有的能量流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "beings 和 energy 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「存有」和「能量」"}

433. And so the full building of the spectrum of all the beings that I was connected to, validated like my communication and my confidence with these certain beings.
→ {"text": "所以我所連結的所有存有的完整光譜的建立，驗證了我與這些特定存有的溝通能力和信心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. So by the time these kids started talking, I'm going, that's a new branch.
→ {"text": "所以當這些孩子開始說話時，我心想，這是一個新的分支。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. Like, this is a new energy.
→ {"text": "這是一種新的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. This is a new thing.
→ {"text": "這是新的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. And so that was validating based on all the other things that had built up my confidence in this healing extrasensory arena.
→ {"text": "所以這是基於所有其他因素的驗證，他們增強了我對超感官療癒方面的信心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "healing 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「療癒」"}


## Speaker Group 142

438. So what happened next?
→ {"text": "那麼接下來發生了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. I mean, after that, you got the hit in the head.
→ {"text": "我是說，在那之後，你得到了那記重擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

440. After that?
→ {"text": "在那之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

441. Then you started hearing these voices.
→ {"text": "然後你開始聽到這些聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. Did you communicate back with them?
→ {"text": "你有回應他們嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. Did you have conversations?
→ {"text": "你們有對話嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

444. For the next probably five months, I had to sleep on it for five months, pretty much.
→ {"text": "接下來大概五個月，我必須沉澱這件事，整整五個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. I knew that it was true.
→ {"text": "我知道這是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. But I was not ready to go forward or do anything with that.
→ {"text": "但我還沒準備好要繼續前進或對此做任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. Like it was just sitting, kind of like dormant, waiting to like burst to another level.
→ {"text": "就像是它只是靜靜地坐在那裡，有點像是處於休眠狀態，等待著爆發到另一個層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. So I just kind of sat with it and let it digest for that long.
→ {"text": "所以我就只是與它同在，讓它消化這麼長時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

449. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. Did you sit on it with more downloads, or no?
→ {"text": "你在沉澱的過程中有接收到更多信息嗎，還是沒有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "downloads 在靈性語境指「下載」（接收訊息）"}


## Speaker Group 147

451. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. No, I just sat with it.
→ {"text": "沒有，我只是與它同在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

453. Didn't ask any more questions?
→ {"text": "沒有問更多問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

454. I didn't ask.
→ {"text": "我沒有問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. That was the only question that needed to be asked at that moment.
→ {"text": "那是當時唯一需要問的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

456. Yeah, gotcha.
→ {"text": "好，了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
