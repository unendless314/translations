## Speaker Group 3

31. Woo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. [LAUGHS]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

33. Wild and crazy stuff...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. So tell us your story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Tell us how you got involved in the alien hybridization program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

36. Yeah, it's the least expected career path I would have ever thought, I guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

37. Career path?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

38. Well, it kind of is a career path.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. It's like, well, it's my passion path, I guess more so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. So it's not what I would have expected.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. And it started with doing a bunch of healing, different trainings that I was doing-- like I told you earlier-- doing different past life stuff, Earthbound spirits, mediumship, of those kind of things-- angels, guides.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. And a part of that was abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. And I thought, I was cool with all the other inter-dimensional stuff, but not abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

44. And this is helping other people with their past lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

45. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. So I would channel that through.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. So I would, like, connect with their other lives and bring that through, or connect with their guides and communicate from them-- those kinds of things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

48. Before we jump ahead, can you just tell me, how did you stumble upon that work in itself?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. Because that realm, it's not common for people to-- it's becoming more common, I guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. But what led you into that path?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

51. One, being in Los Angeles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. So that opens up that door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Two-- you know, it was right after I got out of college.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. And then I went immediately into, like, advertising, big time corporate advertising.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. And just like really dove into the corporate world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. And then after that experience, as well as, like, boyfriends and my own stuff, I just went so deep into something energetically that I wasn't, that I just catapulted to another extreme of I'm going, I need to, like, look at what I really am passionate about, and look at what my gifts are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. And, like, fix my own personal stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Like, why am I experiencing certain things?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

59. And when you say deep in something you weren't, that's the corporate world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

60. The corporate world and stuff like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

61. So you were doing the 9:00 to 5:00--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

62. Yeah, 24 hour iPhone as the pillow kind of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

63. And then that felt not right, so then that's the catapult you're talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. So you went the other direction, the opposite of 9:00 to 5:00-- the opposite of corporate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. OK, gotcha.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

66. And even as a kid, I just was very attuned to, like I loved fairies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. I loved nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. I can sense certain things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. I could definitely feel a lot more going on with people than they knew themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. And I had those extra sensitivities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. And then over the years and years and years of schooling, they started to dwindle, and dwindle, go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. And then once I hit the extreme of then going corporate after all the schooling, it was just so far, that I knew exactly where to go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. I was like, let's go back to nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. Let's go back to my natural self.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. And at that time, too, my dad was heavy into the metaphysical community in LA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. So he was going to Bashar channelings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. And he was doing channeling-like stuff himself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. And then he was connected with a shaman in Los Angeles, and we were doing family constellation work, which heals family traumas that are passed down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. And so he was in that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. And I was dabbling and I knew about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. But once I had gone to such an extreme, I went, OK, well I need to look more at like who I am, and where is this originating from like, in my lineage?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. Why am I creating certain challenge like in relationships?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. What is the source of my motivations in life?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. And so I started working with a shaman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. And I worked with another clairvoyant too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. And I just started learning all that they were doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. And then I could see that I had these sensitivities too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. Once I could see them doing all of that stuff, I went, oh I can do that too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. But it was so natural, that I didn't know I was doing it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

90. Got you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

91. So then I went hmm, well, let's dive into that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. And so then I did different healing trainings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. And at that time, I didn't believe fully-- I didn't have the visceral experience of other lives, like other simultaneous incarnations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. I didn't really believe in Earthbound spirits.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. It wasn't, like intellectually, it wasn't matched with my experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. So that was one of the primary reasons that I went to do the training, was to see if it actually hit to have an experience with these different segments that people just flippantly, like, throw around.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. Like, 'Oh, my past life.'
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. And I'm going, no, how does that relate to this here and now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. And how do you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. Like, where's the knowingness behind that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. So I wanted to know that for myself before I just went around just saying stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

102. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

103. And so then at that training, I experienced crazy things that were-- I mean, even backed up by like Google-- certain things I was channeling of different, like, spirits and crazy things that were just--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

104. When you say backed up by Google, what do you mean by that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. You would Google it later after you've had the experience?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

106. Yeah, after I had the experience, it was like, what I had brought through was actually backed up by like, historically in Google, like different things that had happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

107. Can you describe how?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. You got us going here, for example?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

109. For example, we were staying in a retreat center in San Diego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. And it, itself, had kind of interesting energies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And that day, out of the two week thing, we had worked with Earthbound spirits and worked with people that had passed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. And so that night, my roommate and I were both going back and forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. And she was from England, so she was telling me about all the ghosts in all the castles in England that she would work with and stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. And so we're just dialoguing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. And the door was open.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And the energy was open.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. We were kind of like calling it in, I guess you could say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. And then I could perceive, I could feel beings walk into the room.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. And it was three little girls that I perceived.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And at the same time I felt that, she looked in the same direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. And so I knew that something was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. And we both are going oh, like, something just happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

123. Right, right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

124. And so then, at that moment, we were like OK, this is it!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Like, something's going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. And so I got out my pendulum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. And she's channeling too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. So both of us together were going back and forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. And what came through, through me-- that I could hear from them-- is that there were three little girls that had been murdered on this property by this religious group, by this, like-- I guess he was some kind of bishop or something that ran a center.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. And he murdered them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. And they just were stuck in this dimension, because if it's an abrupt ending or if it's unfinished, then of course, you kind of stay bound to this until it's complete.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. Or if you have a drug overdose, or you get in a car accident, those kinds of things lead to where those beings need extra assistance to move into the light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. And so we worked with these little girls.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

134. Your other friend from England, she was there too?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. Simultaneously getting the same downloads?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

136. Yes, same downloads.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

137. So you were able to confirm with her later the same information?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

138. Yes. >>OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

139. And then at the same time too, so we sent them into the light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. We assisted them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And then, I got on my phone on Google, and they gave me the year, they gave that it was some kind of religious guy that did it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. We knew the location, three little girls.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. And I Googled it, and it was like on Google.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Like, three little girls murdered by this guy at this location.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. And I'm like, oh!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. So that was like my first experience of getting the information and then having it instantly validated to reinforce.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

147. Instantly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Google.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. We can do that now on the phone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. You didn't even wait till you got home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. You went right on the phone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

152. Right on the phone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. I was like, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Am I crazy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. So it was instantly validated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

156. Nice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

157. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
