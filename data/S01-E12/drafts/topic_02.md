## Speaker Group 3

31. Woo.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. [LAUGHS]
→ {"text": "【笑聲】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

33. Wild and crazy stuff...
→ {"text": "又瘋狂又不可思議的事...", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. So tell us your story.
→ {"text": "所以跟我們說說你的故事吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. Tell us how you got involved in the alien hybridization program.
→ {"text": "告訴我們你是怎麼參與到外星混種計畫裡的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

36. Yeah, it's the least expected career path I would have ever thought, I guess.
→ {"text": "是啊，我想這是我最沒料到的職業道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

37. Career path?
→ {"text": "職業道路？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

38. Well, it kind of is a career path.
→ {"text": "嗯，某種程度上算是職業道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. It's like, well, it's my passion path, I guess more so.
→ {"text": "應該說，更像是我的熱情所在吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. So it's not what I would have expected.
→ {"text": "所以這不是我原本預期的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. And it started with doing a bunch of healing, different trainings that I was doing-- like I told you earlier-- doing different past life stuff, Earthbound spirits, mediumship, of those kind of things-- angels, guides.
→ {"text": "這一切始於我做的各種療癒工作、不同的訓練——就像我之前跟你說的——處理前世相關的東西、留滯的靈魂、靈媒工作，那些東西——天使、指導靈之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. And a part of that was abduction.
→ {"text": "而其中一部分涉及綁架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. And I thought, I was cool with all the other inter-dimensional stuff, but not abduction.
→ {"text": "我當時想，其他跨維度的東西我都能接受，但綁架不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

44. And this is helping other people with their past lives.
→ {"text": "所以你是在幫別人處理他們的前世。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

45. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. So I would channel that through.
→ {"text": "所以我會通靈傳遞這些訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. So I would, like, connect with their other lives and bring that through, or connect with their guides and communicate from them-- those kinds of things.
→ {"text": "我會連結他們的其他生世並把訊息帶過來，或者連結他們的指導靈、從指導靈那裡傳達訊息——就是那類的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

48. Before we jump ahead, can you just tell me, how did you stumble upon that work in itself?
→ {"text": "在我們繼續之前，你能告訴我，你是怎麼踏入這個領域的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Because that realm, it's not common for people to-- it's becoming more common, I guess.
→ {"text": "因為這個領域，對一般人來說並不常見——雖然我想現在越來越普遍了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. But what led you into that path?
→ {"text": "但是什麼引導你走上這條路的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

51. One, being in Los Angeles.
→ {"text": "第一，我住在洛杉磯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. So that opens up that door.
→ {"text": "所以那就打開了那扇門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Two-- you know, it was right after I got out of college.
→ {"text": "第二——你知道的，那是在我大學畢業之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. And then I went immediately into, like, advertising, big time corporate advertising.
→ {"text": "然後我馬上就進入廣告業，那種大型企業廣告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. And just like really dove into the corporate world.
→ {"text": "就真的完全投入了企業界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. And then after that experience, as well as, like, boyfriends and my own stuff, I just went so deep into something energetically that I wasn't, that I just catapulted to another extreme of I'm going, I need to, like, look at what I really am passionate about, and look at what my gifts are.
→ {"text": "然後在那段經歷之後，加上像是男朋友和我自己的問題，我在能量上深陷於一個不屬於我的東西裡，結果就彈射到另一個極端，我想，我需要去看看我真正熱愛的是什麼，看看我的天賦是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. And, like, fix my own personal stuff.
→ {"text": "還有，去處理我自己的個人問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. Like, why am I experiencing certain things?
→ {"text": "像是，我為什麼會經歷某些事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

59. And when you say deep in something you weren't, that's the corporate world?
→ {"text": "你說深陷在不屬於你的東西裡，指的是企業界？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

60. The corporate world and stuff like that.
→ {"text": "企業界和那類東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

61. So you were doing the 9:00 to 5:00--
→ {"text": "所以你當時是朝九晚五——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

62. Yeah, 24 hour iPhone as the pillow kind of thing.
→ {"text": "對，24 小時 iPhone 當枕頭那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

63. And then that felt not right, so then that's the catapult you're talking about.
→ {"text": "然後那感覺不對，所以那就是你說的彈射點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. So you went the other direction, the opposite of 9:00 to 5:00-- the opposite of corporate.
→ {"text": "所以你走向另一個方向，朝九晚五的反面——企業界的反面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. OK, gotcha.
→ {"text": "好，懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

66. And even as a kid, I just was very attuned to, like I loved fairies.
→ {"text": "而且我從小就很能感應，像是我超愛精靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. I loved nature.
→ {"text": "我熱愛大自然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. I can sense certain things.
→ {"text": "我能感知到某些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. I could definitely feel a lot more going on with people than they knew themselves.
→ {"text": "我絕對能感覺到別人身上發生的事，比他們自己知道的還多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. And I had those extra sensitivities.
→ {"text": "我有那些額外的敏感度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. And then over the years and years and years of schooling, they started to dwindle, and dwindle, go away.
→ {"text": "然後經過多年、多年、多年的學校教育，那些敏感度開始減弱，減弱，消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. And then once I hit the extreme of then going corporate after all the schooling, it was just so far, that I knew exactly where to go.
→ {"text": "然後當我走到極端，在所有學校教育之後進入企業界，那已經太遠了，我很清楚該往哪裡走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. I was like, let's go back to nature.
→ {"text": "我想，讓我們回到自然吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. Let's go back to my natural self.
→ {"text": "讓我回到我真實的自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. And at that time, too, my dad was heavy into the metaphysical community in LA.
→ {"text": "而且在那個時候，我爸也深度參與洛杉磯的形上學社群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. So he was going to Bashar channelings.
→ {"text": "所以他會去參加 Bashar 的通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Bashar 是通靈存有名稱，保留英文"}

77. And he was doing channeling-like stuff himself.
→ {"text": "而且他自己也在做通靈之類的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And then he was connected with a shaman in Los Angeles, and we were doing family constellation work, which heals family traumas that are passed down.
→ {"text": "然後他跟洛杉磯的一位薩滿有連結，我們在做家庭系統排列，那是用來療癒代代相傳的家族創傷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. And so he was in that.
→ {"text": "所以他投入在那個裡面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. And I was dabbling and I knew about it.
→ {"text": "而我只是淺嚐，但我知道那些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. But once I had gone to such an extreme, I went, OK, well I need to look more at like who I am, and where is this originating from like, in my lineage?
→ {"text": "但一旦我走到那麼極端，我就想，好吧，我需要更深入看看我到底是誰，這些東西在我的血脈中從何而來？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. Why am I creating certain challenge like in relationships?
→ {"text": "為什麼我在關係中創造出某些挑戰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. What is the source of my motivations in life?
→ {"text": "我生命動機的源頭是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. And so I started working with a shaman.
→ {"text": "所以我開始跟一位薩滿合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. And I worked with another clairvoyant too.
→ {"text": "我也跟另一位靈視者合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. And I just started learning all that they were doing.
→ {"text": "然後我就開始學習他們所做的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. And then I could see that I had these sensitivities too.
→ {"text": "然後我發現我也有這些敏感度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. Once I could see them doing all of that stuff, I went, oh I can do that too.
→ {"text": "一旦我看到他們做那些事，我就想，喔，我也可以做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. But it was so natural, that I didn't know I was doing it.
→ {"text": "但那太自然了，我都不知道自己在做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

90. Got you.
→ {"text": "了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

91. So then I went hmm, well, let's dive into that.
→ {"text": "所以我就想，嗯，那我們來深入探索吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. And so then I did different healing trainings.
→ {"text": "所以我就去做了各種療癒訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. And at that time, I didn't believe fully-- I didn't have the visceral experience of other lives, like other simultaneous incarnations.
→ {"text": "而在那個時候，我並沒有完全相信——我沒有對其他生世的切身體驗，像是其他同時發生的轉世。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. I didn't really believe in Earthbound spirits.
→ {"text": "我並不真的相信留滯的靈魂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. It wasn't, like intellectually, it wasn't matched with my experience.
→ {"text": "在理智上，那沒有跟我的經驗相符。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. So that was one of the primary reasons that I went to do the training, was to see if it actually hit to have an experience with these different segments that people just flippantly, like, throw around.
→ {"text": "所以那是我去參加訓練的主要原因之一，就是要看看這些人隨口說說的不同概念，是否真的能讓我有實際體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. Like, 'Oh, my past life.'
→ {"text": "像是，「噢，我的前世。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. And I'm going, no, how does that relate to this here and now?
→ {"text": "而我會想，不，那跟此時此地有什麼關係？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. And how do you know?
→ {"text": "你怎麼知道的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. Like, where's the knowingness behind that?
→ {"text": "那背後的知曉來自哪裡？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. So I wanted to know that for myself before I just went around just saying stuff.
→ {"text": "所以我想在到處亂說之前，先親自了解那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

102. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

103. And so then at that training, I experienced crazy things that were-- I mean, even backed up by like Google-- certain things I was channeling of different, like, spirits and crazy things that were just--
→ {"text": "所以在那個訓練中，我經歷了一些瘋狂的事，甚至連 Google 都能查證——我通靈接收到的某些東西，關於不同的靈魂和一些瘋狂的事，那些就是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

104. When you say backed up by Google, what do you mean by that?
→ {"text": "你說 Google 能查證，那是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. You would Google it later after you've had the experience?
→ {"text": "你是在經歷之後再去 Google 查嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

106. Yeah, after I had the experience, it was like, what I had brought through was actually backed up by like, historically in Google, like different things that had happened.
→ {"text": "對，在我有了那個經歷之後，我所接收到的訊息，竟然在 Google 上能找到歷史記錄，像是發生過的不同事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

107. Can you describe how?
→ {"text": "你能描述一下怎麼回事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. You got us going here, for example?
→ {"text": "舉個例子讓我們了解一下？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

109. For example, we were staying in a retreat center in San Diego.
→ {"text": "舉例來說，我們當時住在聖地牙哥的一個靜修中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. And it, itself, had kind of interesting energies.
→ {"text": "那個地方本身就有一些有趣的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. And that day, out of the two week thing, we had worked with Earthbound spirits and worked with people that had passed.
→ {"text": "那天，在為期兩週的課程中，我們處理了留滯的靈魂，跟已逝世的人的靈魂工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. And so that night, my roommate and I were both going back and forth.
→ {"text": "所以那天晚上，我和我的室友兩個人一直在聊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. And she was from England, so she was telling me about all the ghosts in all the castles in England that she would work with and stuff.
→ {"text": "她來自英國，所以她跟我講她在英國所有城堡裡會處理的那些鬼魂之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. And so we're just dialoguing.
→ {"text": "所以我們就這樣對話著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. And the door was open.
→ {"text": "門是開著的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And the energy was open.
→ {"text": "能量是敞開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. We were kind of like calling it in, I guess you could say.
→ {"text": "我想你可以說，我們像是在召喚它進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. And then I could perceive, I could feel beings walk into the room.
→ {"text": "然後我能感知到，我能感覺到有存有走進房間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. And it was three little girls that I perceived.
→ {"text": "我感知到的是三個小女孩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. And at the same time I felt that, she looked in the same direction.
→ {"text": "就在我感覺到的同時，她往同一個方向看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. And so I knew that something was going on.
→ {"text": "所以我知道有什麼事正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. And we both are going oh, like, something just happened.
→ {"text": "我們倆都說，喔，有什麼事剛剛發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

123. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

124. And so then, at that moment, we were like OK, this is it!
→ {"text": "所以在那一刻，我們就想，好，就是這個！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. Like, something's going on.
→ {"text": "有事情正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. And so I got out my pendulum.
→ {"text": "所以我拿出我的靈擺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. And she's channeling too.
→ {"text": "她也在通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. So both of us together were going back and forth.
→ {"text": "所以我們兩個一起來回確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. And what came through, through me-- that I could hear from them-- is that there were three little girls that had been murdered on this property by this religious group, by this, like-- I guess he was some kind of bishop or something that ran a center.
→ {"text": "然後通過我傳來的訊息——我能聽到她們說的——是有三個小女孩在這塊地上被這個宗教團體謀殺了，被這個，像是——我想他是某種主教之類的，經營一個中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. And he murdered them.
→ {"text": "而他謀殺了她們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. And they just were stuck in this dimension, because if it's an abrupt ending or if it's unfinished, then of course, you kind of stay bound to this until it's complete.
→ {"text": "而她們就被困在這個維度裡，因為如果是突然結束或未完成的，那當然，你會一直被束縛在這裡直到完結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. Or if you have a drug overdose, or you get in a car accident, those kinds of things lead to where those beings need extra assistance to move into the light.
→ {"text": "或者如果你藥物過量，或車禍意外，那類的事會導致這些存有需要額外的協助才能走向光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. And so we worked with these little girls.
→ {"text": "所以我們跟這些小女孩一起工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

134. Your other friend from England, she was there too?
→ {"text": "你那位來自英國的朋友，她也在場？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. Simultaneously getting the same downloads?
→ {"text": "同時接收到一樣的訊息？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

136. Yes, same downloads.
→ {"text": "對，一樣的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

137. So you were able to confirm with her later the same information?
→ {"text": "所以你後來能跟她確認同樣的資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

138. Yes. >>OK.
→ {"text": "對。好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

139. And then at the same time too, so we sent them into the light.
→ {"text": "然後同時，我們把她們送進光裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. We assisted them.
→ {"text": "我們協助了她們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. And then, I got on my phone on Google, and they gave me the year, they gave that it was some kind of religious guy that did it.
→ {"text": "然後，我用手機上 Google，她們給了我年份，她們說是某種宗教人士幹的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. We knew the location, three little girls.
→ {"text": "我們知道地點，三個小女孩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And I Googled it, and it was like on Google.
→ {"text": "我 Google 了，結果真的在 Google 上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. Like, three little girls murdered by this guy at this location.
→ {"text": "就像，三個小女孩在這個地點被這個人謀殺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. And I'm like, oh!
→ {"text": "我就想，天啊！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. So that was like my first experience of getting the information and then having it instantly validated to reinforce.
→ {"text": "所以那就像是我第一次得到訊息，然後立即被驗證強化的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

147. Instantly.
→ {"text": "立即。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. Google.
→ {"text": "Google。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. We can do that now on the phone.
→ {"text": "我們現在可以在手機上做到這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. You didn't even wait till you got home.
→ {"text": "你甚至沒等到回家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. You went right on the phone.
→ {"text": "你直接用手機查了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

152. Right on the phone.
→ {"text": "直接用手機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. I was like, OK.
→ {"text": "我就想，好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. Am I crazy?
→ {"text": "我瘋了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. So it was instantly validated.
→ {"text": "所以那立刻被驗證了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

156. Nice.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

157. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
