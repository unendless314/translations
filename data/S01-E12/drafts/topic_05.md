## Speaker Group 217

633. [LAUGHS] So getting back to the hybrid children-- because that's your focus right now-- can you tell us how that started, and where are we at?
→ {"text": "【笑聲】那麼回到混種孩子的話題，因為這是你現在的重心，你能告訴我們這一切是如何開始的，以及我們現在進展到哪裡了嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. Catch us up to speed with the whole children project.
→ {"text": "讓我們跟上整個混種孩子計劃的進度吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

635. Well, how it started was through the mixing of the DNA in the abduction program.
→ {"text": "嗯，這一切是從綁架計劃中的 DNA 混合開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. So they would use the human genetics, and then mix it with the Gray genetics, do their stuff, and then create these kids from that.
→ {"text": "所以他們會使用人類的基因，然後與灰人的基因混合，進行他們的操作，然後從中創造出這些孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. And there's been different generations.
→ {"text": "而且經歷了不同的世代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. The first ones were very sickly and didn't make it.
→ {"text": "最早的那些非常虛弱，沒能存活下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. The later ones did make it and are thriving.
→ {"text": "後來的那些存活下來了，而且正在茁壯成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

640. And what was the reason for not making it?
→ {"text": "那沒能存活下來的原因是什麼呢?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

641. The reason for not making it was the lack of humanity.
→ {"text": "沒能存活的原因是缺乏人性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

642. The lack of humanity?
→ {"text": "缺乏人性?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

643. The lack of nurture, you know?
→ {"text": "缺乏養育，你知道的吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. It's this idea that science and genetics, and even their energetic know-how of, like, creating an energetic template vessel for incarnation, they could do all of that stuff.
→ {"text": "就是這樣的概念:科學和基因學，甚至他們在能量方面的知識，比如創造一個用於轉世的能量模板載體，他們都能做到這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "energetic template vessel for incarnation 依據 terminology.yaml"}

645. But when it came down to it, these kids couldn't make it because of a lack of this missing link of love, of like emotion and of connection.
→ {"text": "但到頭來，這些孩子無法存活，是因為缺少了這個關鍵的連結：愛，還有情感與連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

646. So literally, they went so far in their intellect, that their lack of emotions has-- it's like the missing link that they still, even that far advanced, even that far evolved-- thousands, if not millions of years in the future-- they're missing the one component that we all know creates life.
→ {"text": "所以實際上，他們的智力發展得如此之遠，但他們缺乏情感，這就像是那個缺失的環節，即便他們如此先進，如此進化，來自未來數千年，甚至數百萬年之後，他們仍然缺少我們都知道的那個創造生命的關鍵元素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. Doesn't matter--
→ {"text": "不管是", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

648. --what planet.
→ {"text": "什麼星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

649. --what planet we're in, what religion I guess you are, from what part of humanity you're from.
→ {"text": "不管我們在什麼星球，你信什麼宗教，你來自人類的哪個部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. But we all know in every movie, that's the big lesson in everything in all of our stories, and our religions, and our science fiction.
→ {"text": "但我們都知道，在每部電影裡、在我們所有的故事裡、在我們的宗教裡、在我們的科幻作品裡，那都是最重要的教訓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

651. Everything is love.
→ {"text": "一切都是愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. It's all about love.
→ {"text": "全都關乎愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

653. So that's the missing link.
→ {"text": "所以那就是缺失的環節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

654. That's the missing link.
→ {"text": "那就是缺失的環節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

655. --that they have forgotten.
→ {"text": "他們已經遺忘的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

656. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. And the human mothers-- there were some human mothers amongst the fearful scenario of being abducted-- could maintain this love for their alien mutated child.
→ {"text": "而那些人類母親，在被綁架的恐懼情境中，有一些人類母親能夠為她們那外星混種的孩子維持這份愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. And nurture them to the degree that they could thrive-- well, could survive, and then eventually thrive.
→ {"text": "並且養育他們到足以讓他們茁壯成長的程度，嗯，能夠存活下來，然後最終茁壯成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. And so that altered the race.
→ {"text": "所以這改變了這個族群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. And it also altered-- I mean, that was a big shift, I think, even in the human collective, to be able to love.
→ {"text": "而且這也改變了，我的意思是，我認為那是一個巨大的轉變，即便是對人類集體意識而言，能夠去愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "collective 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為集體意識"}

661. I mean, it is your offspring, but to love something alien, you know?
→ {"text": "我是說，那是你的後代，但要去愛一個外星的存在，你懂嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. And it's this mixing that's happening.
→ {"text": "而正在發生的就是這種混合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. And much of this is happening in the sub and unconscious.
→ {"text": "而且這其中大部分都發生在潛意識和無意識之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. It's like hidden away memories.
→ {"text": "就像被隱藏起來的記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. But it is shifting and now translating into the collective consciousness in a really powerful way.
→ {"text": "但它正在轉變，現在正以一種非常強大的方式轉化進入集體意識之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "collective consciousness 依據 terminology.yaml"}


## Speaker Group 229

666. I'm just going to mention something.
→ {"text": "我想提一下一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. So actually, I recently saw TED Talks of this autistic boy who-- or at least, he was diagnosed with autism.
→ {"text": "所以實際上，我最近看到一個關於自閉症男孩的 TED 演講，或至少，他被診斷為自閉症。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "TED Talks 保留原文"}

668. And he got over his autism.
→ {"text": "而他克服了他的自閉症。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. And I'll put a link into this video here.
→ {"text": "我會在這裡放上影片的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. But he actually was able to overcome his autism by love-- his parents loving him.
→ {"text": "但他實際上能夠通過愛克服他的自閉症，他父母對他的愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. It wasn't any kind of superfood or anything that they gave him.
→ {"text": "那不是他們給他的什麼超級食物或任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. He says, I got over the hardships I had because of my parents taking the time to spend the time with me, and be with me, and nurture me, and love me.
→ {"text": "他說，我克服了我所經歷的困難，是因為我父母花時間陪伴我、與我在一起、養育我、愛我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. And that's what healed these autistic traits that he had.
→ {"text": "而那就是療癒了他所擁有的這些自閉症特質的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "healed 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為療癒"}


## Speaker Group 230

674. Jeez.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

675. And there's videos of him, like-- it was hardcore.
→ {"text": "而且有他的影片，就是情況很嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. It was messed up.
→ {"text": "真的很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

677. That's amazing.
→ {"text": "那真是太驚人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

678. So it makes sense.
→ {"text": "所以這說得通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

679. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

680. Yeah, it's great.
→ {"text": "是的，這很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. So now, these children are thriving.
→ {"text": "所以現在，這些孩子正在茁壯成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. And what's going on?
→ {"text": "那麼接下來是什麼呢?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. What are they saying?
→ {"text": "他們還說了哪些?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

684. Well, so now, they're energetically and physically connected to their parents, which are us-- who are us.
→ {"text": "嗯，所以現在，他們在能量上和物理上都與他們的父母連結，也就是我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "energy 依據 terminology.yaml"}

685. And it is their sole motivation to telepathically just inundate us with these memories, and to connect with us in dream time, and to also just implant in us this reality that we've chosen to go towards.
→ {"text": "而且他們唯一的動機就是用心靈感應的方式，讓我們充滿這些記憶，在夢境時間與我們連結，並且將我們選擇要前往的這個實相植入我們之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "reality 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為實相"}

686. It's like, OK, go more in this direction.
→ {"text": "就像是，好，再往這個方向多走一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. Go more in this direction.
→ {"text": "再往這個方向多走一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

688. So they're really, right now, our guides--
→ {"text": "所以他們現在真的是我們的指導靈", "confidence": "high", "notes": "guides 依據 terminology.yaml"}


## Speaker Group 237

689. Yeah, OK.
→ {"text": "是的，好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

690. --back to ourselves.
→ {"text": "引導我們回到我們自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

691. You know, I'm just thinking about the first humans to arrive on Earth, if they came to this planet in a similar-type fashion.
→ {"text": "你知道，我在想第一批到達地球的人類，如果他們是以類似的方式來到這個星球的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. I wonder if there was that kind of connection to their home world that they had to come in and-- I'm just trying to imagine trying to bring it home, in some way.
→ {"text": "我在想是否有那種與他們母星的連結必須進入，我只是試著想像，試著以某種方式把這個概念帶回家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. So if we can imagine Earth and humans, these first hybrid humans being here and still having, energetically, their parents off world on another planet, and how that connection would happen, it doesn't seem that far out when you start to think of it in those aspects.
→ {"text": "所以如果我們能想像地球和人類，這些最初的混種人類在這裡，並且在能量上仍然擁有他們在另一個星球上的外星父母，以及那種連結如何發生，當你開始從這些角度思考時，這似乎也不是那麼遙不可及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "hybrid humans 依據 terminology.yaml;energy 依據 terminology.yaml"}


## Speaker Group 240

694. Well, and it is close to home.
→ {"text": "嗯，而且這離家很近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. I mean, we're in Sedona.
→ {"text": "我是說，我們在賽多納。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Sedona 依據 guidelines.md 譯為賽多納"}

696. But the Phoenix Lights '97, right?
→ {"text": "但是 1997 年的鳳凰城光點事件，對吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Phoenix Lights 依據 terminology.yaml"}

697. Shalanaya mother ship came over--

## Speaker Group 241

698. Wait, Shala--

## Speaker Group 242

699. Shalanaya.
→ {"text": "夏來納亞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Shalanaya 依據 terminology.yaml"}

700. That's the first hybrid race.

701. And they'll be the first ones to land.
→ {"text": "而他們會是第一批降落的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

702. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

703. The first hybrid race, but the hybrid kids will be the first to contact beings.
→ {"text": "第一個混種族群，但混種孩子將會是第一批接觸存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "beings 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為存有"}

704. And the hybrid kids are on that ship.
→ {"text": "而混種孩子就在那艘船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. Like, some of them live on that actual ship.
→ {"text": "就像，他們有些人就住在那艘實際的飛船上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

706. And then Shalanaya ships have actually been seen on this property by one of my good friends.
→ {"text": "然後夏來納亞的飛船實際上曾經在這片土地上被我的一個好朋友看到過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Shalanaya 依據 terminology.yaml"}

707. And so the kids, I mean, they're right there, you know?
→ {"text": "所以這些孩子，我的意思是，他們就在那裡，你知道嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. I mean, it's like they're on an airplane or something.
→ {"text": "我是說，就像他們在一架飛機上還是什麼的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. Ah, behind the tree.
→ {"text": "啊，在樹後面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. I can picture.
→ {"text": "我可以想像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

711. Peeking around the corner, hey.
→ {"text": "從角落偷看，嘿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

712. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

713. Go back to bed.
→ {"text": "回床上去吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

714. [LAUGHS] How does this story end?
→ {"text": "【笑聲】這個故事如何結束?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

715. The story ends, well, kind of how it begins.
→ {"text": "這個故事如何結束，嗯，有點像它如何開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

716. Well, you can see how it ends by the trajectory of how it has started, that I was told that I confirmed that I have hybrid kids.
→ {"text": "嗯，你可以從它如何開始的軌跡看出它如何結束，就是我被告知、我確認了我有混種孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

717. And after that session, about three hybrid moms came up to me.
→ {"text": "而在那次療程之後，大約有三位混種孩子的母親來找我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

718. And they already knew that they had kids.
→ {"text": "而她們已經知道她們有孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

719. And at that time, it was very like, whisper about having hybrid kids.
→ {"text": "而在那個時候，擁有混種孩子這件事是非常低調的，像是耳語般。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

720. It was very like, tucked away and not really outspoken about this.
→ {"text": "非常像是被藏起來的，並不真的公開談論這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

721. And there were maybe like different abductees who knew about it.
→ {"text": "而可能有一些不同的被綁架者知道這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

722. But it wasn't like a known out there thing.
→ {"text": "但這不是一件廣為人知的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

723. And that next day, it became very clear that my soul's dedication was to make the hybrid children known.
→ {"text": "而在隔天，變得非常清楚的是，我靈魂的使命就是讓混種孩子為人所知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

724. And so for the rest of that summer, I didn't do anything else.
→ {"text": "所以在那個夏天剩餘的時間裡，我什麼其他事都沒做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

725. I stopped all other work.
→ {"text": "我停下了所有其他的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

726. And I just started creating the hybrid website for the community.
→ {"text": "我只是開始為社群創建混種孩子的網站。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

727. And I started connecting with my kids, because I couldn't connect with anyone else.
→ {"text": "而我開始與我的孩子連結，因為我無法與其他任何人連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

728. I didn't even know that I was going to connect other people to their kids.
→ {"text": "我甚至不知道我會去幫助其他人與他們的孩子連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

729. I didn't know that.
→ {"text": "我當時完全沒概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

730. All I was starting with was, like, OK.
→ {"text": "我開始時想的只是，好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

731. I'm the parent.
→ {"text": "我是父母。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

732. I'm going to start connecting with my children.
→ {"text": "我要開始與我的孩子連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

733. And I wanted a space to be made for other parents to have this be known, and for it to be findable-- like, for it to be known in that way.
→ {"text": "而我想要創造一個空間，讓其他父母能夠知道這件事，並且能夠找到，以那種方式讓它為人所知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

734. And then later, I found out that I was designed to do that, that there would be those online platforms that people would come to.
→ {"text": "後來，我發現我就是注定來做這件事的，創立那些人們會使用的線上平台。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

735. Interesting.
→ {"text": "真有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

736. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

737. So then, it started.
→ {"text": "所以接著，它就開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

738. And then, the first month, it was like 100 unique visits.
→ {"text": "然後，第一個月大概是 100 個不重複訪客。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

739. 100 unique visits?
→ {"text": "100 個不重複訪客?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

740. Per month, to the website.
→ {"text": "每個月，網站的訪客數。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

741. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

742. Just very, very small.
→ {"text": "就是非常非常少。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

743. And within a year, it hit 20,000.
→ {"text": "而在一年之內，它達到了 20，000。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

744. So in one year, hybrid alien children went to 20,000.
→ {"text": "所以在一年之內，外星混種孩子網站的訪客數達到了 20，000。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

745. And now--
→ {"text": "而現在", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

746. Is this the Facebook page?
→ {"text": "是 Facebook 頁面嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

747. This is the website.
→ {"text": "是一個網站。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

748. The actual website, OK.
→ {"text": "實際的網站，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

749. So it's like exponential growth.
→ {"text": "所以這就像是指數型成長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

750. I'll put a link in here for everybody, so they can see that.
→ {"text": "我會在這裡為大家放上連結，這樣大家就能看到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

751. Insert link.
→ {"text": "插入連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

752. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

753. So it's the exponential growth has been the fascinating thing for me to watch, and how a few emails trickle in here and there.
→ {"text": "所以這個指數型成長對我來說一直是很迷人的觀察，還有那些零星進來的幾封電子郵件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

754. And then it's just like, I'm inundated every day with people messaging me.
→ {"text": "然後就像是，我每天都被人們的訊息淹沒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

755. And so the wake up process and the next step, as you were asking, is that people are gonna remember.
→ {"text": "所以覺醒的過程以及下一步，像你所問的，人們將會恢復記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

756. People are gonna have dreams about these kids.
→ {"text": "人們將會夢到這些孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

757. People are gonna have memories about all of this.
→ {"text": "人們將會有關於這一切的記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

758. Know the next stages of moving, of the assimilation of moving to these sacred sites.
→ {"text": "知道前往的下一個階段，也就是同化並搬遷到這些聖地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sacred sites 依據 terminology.yaml"}

759. All of this information is coming and is already happening.
→ {"text": "所有這些資訊都正在到來，而且已經在發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

760. And I see these people.
→ {"text": "而我看到這些人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

761. It's amping up in the collective in such a big and powerful way.
→ {"text": "它正在集體意識中以如此巨大而強力的方式增長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "collective 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為集體意識"}

762. It's really fun and crazy for even me to watch.
→ {"text": "即便對我來說，觀察這一切也真的很有趣又瘋狂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

763. Like, I didn't know where this was going.
→ {"text": "就像，我不知道這會往哪裡去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

764. And so I'm just kind of-- I'm the driver, but I'm also like the observer.
→ {"text": "所以我只是有點像，我是駕駛者，但我也像是觀察者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 261

765. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

766. It's great to acknowledge that.
→ {"text": "能夠認知到這一點很棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

767. So your work right now is in addition to working with your own children, you're kind of this conduit, this go-to person for people to connect.
→ {"text": "所以你現在的工作除了與你自己的孩子工作之外，你也有點像是這個媒介，是人們尋求連結的對象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "conduit 依據 terminology.yaml"}

768. And how do you explain your work in that sense?
→ {"text": "那你如何解釋你在那方面的工作?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

769. How do you help people connect with their hybrid children?
→ {"text": "你如何幫助人們與他們的混種孩子連結?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

770. I help them connect by, I guess, you can picture it as like a cord, like a plug-in cord-- that, like, I have the cord.
→ {"text": "我幫助他們連結的方式，我想，你可以把它想像成像是一條線，像是插頭的線，就是，我有這條線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

771. And I just, like, plug it in to them.
→ {"text": "而我就像是，把它插到他們身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

772. And somehow, I was given the cord.
→ {"text": "而不知怎麼的，我被賦予了這條線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

773. And it's a kind of a hard cord to find because it's deeply buried in the subconscious and unconscious.
→ {"text": "而這是一種很難找到的線，因為它深埋在潛意識和無意識之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

774. So I just connect it.
→ {"text": "所以我只是連結它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

775. So there's an energetic cording that I connect, that is more of like a astral activity.
→ {"text": "所以有一個我連結的能量連線，那更像是一種星光層的活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "energetic cording 依據 terminology.yaml;astral 依據 terminology.yaml"}

776. I don't do it consciously, but it just happens.
→ {"text": "我不是有意識地去做，但它就是發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

777. And then I also bring through-- I get the clairvoyant image of the child.
→ {"text": "然後我得到孩子的靈視影像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "clairvoyant 依據 terminology.yaml"}

778. Or they talk to me through all the different senses that I perceive.
→ {"text": "或者他們透過我所有不同的感官與我交談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

779. And I deliver whatever messages, deliver about their essence, deliver their image-- whatever the parent needs to know that's going to benefit them in the next stage of their connection with their child.
→ {"text": "而我傳遞任何訊息，傳遞關於他們本質的資訊，傳遞他們的形象，任何父母需要知道的、將在他們與孩子連結的下一個階段中使他們受益的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

780. That's what I bring through.
→ {"text": "那就是我帶來的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

781. Excellent.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

782. And for every person, it's a different message, I assume.
→ {"text": "而對每個人來說，我想訊息都是不同的吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

783. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

784. It's very different, and it could be things that they might not want to hear.
→ {"text": "非常不同，而且可能是他們不想聽到的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

785. Well, for example, has anybody not received the information very well?
→ {"text": "嗯，比如說，有沒有人沒有很好地接受這些資訊?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

786. In what case when you say, not what they want to hear?
→ {"text": "在什麼情況下你會說，不是他們想聽到的?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

787. Well, I guess, maybe that wasn't even accurate.
→ {"text": "嗯，我想，也許那甚至不準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

788. Because every person-- I've probably done about 50 in the past few years.
→ {"text": "因為每個人，我在過去幾年大概做了 50 次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

789. And every person has completely-- like, it's really hit them on a very deep level.
→ {"text": "而每個人都完全像是，這確實在非常深的層面觸動了他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

790. And they've all resonated.
→ {"text": "而他們都產生了共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

791. Maybe the not what they want to hear is the shifting that they need to do to be able to meet them.
→ {"text": "也許不是他們想聽到的，是他們需要做出的轉變，才能與他們見面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

792. Because it's not like you can just stay at your 9:00 to 5:00 job, like, chowing down on a burger, and, like, they're going to move into your house in the neighborhood.
→ {"text": "因為這不像是你可以只待在朝九晚五的工作，狼吞虎咽地吃著漢堡，然後他們就會搬進你在社區裡的房子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

793. So, explain, for example, what are some of the shifts that need to take place?
→ {"text": "所以，解釋一下，比如說，有哪些需要發生的轉變?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

794. Some of the shifts that need to take place are, one is for the human parents to follow their excitement-- to, like, really align themselves with their passion.
→ {"text": "一些需要發生的轉變是，其中一個是讓人類父母追隨他們的興奮，就像，真正讓自己與他們的熱情對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "align 依據 terminology.yaml"}

795. Because only in that state will they be able to shift to where they can actually meet them.
→ {"text": "因為只有在那種狀態下，他們才能夠轉變到可以真正與他們見面的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

796. So one is the transition to having them be more themselves, which is a lot.
→ {"text": "所以其中之一就是轉變為讓他們更成為自己，這是很大的轉變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

797. In some cases, it could be visiting certain places, that they need to go visit certain places to make a certain connection.
→ {"text": "在某些情況下，可能是造訪某些地方，他們需要去造訪某些地方以建立特定的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

798. They might need to go to a sacred site.
→ {"text": "他們可能需要去一個聖地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sacred sites 依據 terminology.yaml"}

799. They might need to move to a different place.
→ {"text": "他們可能需要搬到不同的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

800. And the children actually come through and say this?
→ {"text": "而孩子們實際上會傳達並說這些嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

801. Yeah, in some cases.
→ {"text": "是的，在某些情況下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

802. I use my own filter in the way of knowing how much is too much.
→ {"text": "我用我自己的過濾方式來判斷訊息是否太多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

803. Because the kid would push them all the way.
→ {"text": "因為孩子會一路推進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

804. The kid is like, go, you know?
→ {"text": "孩子就像是在說，上啊，你懂嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

805. You look at the person and you're like, where they're at.
→ {"text": "你看著這個人，然後你觀察他們的處境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

806. And you're like, OK, are they resonating with this information?
→ {"text": "然後你就想，好的，他們會對這個資訊產生共鳴嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

807. Or are they are they taking steps back?
→ {"text": "或者他們是在逃避?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

808. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

809. So I give as much as is going to be helpful.
→ {"text": "所以我只會提供有幫助的訊息量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

810. Because if say, like, give up your whole life and go to Tibet--
→ {"text": "因為如果說，放棄你的生活然後去西藏", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

811. Then they're going to throw the whole out not listen to any of it.
→ {"text": "那他們就會把整個訊息給忽略，什麼都聽不進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

812. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

813. And the kid understands that.
→ {"text": "而孩子理解這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

814. And I have dialogues with them too.
→ {"text": "而我也與他們對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

815. Do they knock on your door afterwards and say, why didn't you tell them this?
→ {"text": "他們會在事後敲你的門說，你為什麼不告訴他們這個嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

816. Or, why didn't you tell them that?
→ {"text": "或者，你為什麼不告訴他們那個?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

817. And then you say, well, because this.
→ {"text": "然後你說，嗯，因為這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

818. And they say, oh, OK.
→ {"text": "然後他們說，哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

819. Do you do have those kind of?
→ {"text": "你有那種經驗嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

820. Kind of, yeah.
→ {"text": "有，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

821. The kind of conversation, how it goes?
→ {"text": "那些對話，是怎麼進行的?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

822. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

823. So I'll give you a scenario.
→ {"text": "所以我給你一個情境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

824. One of my childhood friends-- well, our families were friends, I met him maybe once when I was, like, five.
→ {"text": "我的一個童年朋友，嗯，我們的家庭是朋友，我大概在五歲的時候見過他一次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

825. And I never met him, but we always knew about each other-- similar age.

826. And he's an artist too, very creative.

827. And finally, there was something when this hybrid children thing started.
→ {"text": "最後，當這個混種孩子的事情開始時，有些事情發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

828. It was like, you need to go back to Utah and connect with this guy that I had never met in person.
→ {"text": "就像是，你需要回到猶他州，與這個我從未親自見過面的人連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

829. And so we connected.
→ {"text": "所以我們連結了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

830. And within 10 minutes, he starts telling me about these things-- abduction experiences that started happening right when he hit puberty.
→ {"text": "而在 10 分鐘內，他開始告訴我這些事情，綁架經歷，就在他進入青春期時開始發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

831. I'm like, OK.
→ {"text": "我就像，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

832. I knew that.

833. And I very quickly heard and felt that he had these hybrid kids, and that we particularly had hybrid kids together.
→ {"text": "而我很快地聽到並感覺到他有這些混種孩子，而且我們特別地共同擁有混種孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

834. And we were just friends and stuff, but they used our genetic material together.

835. And so then I told him about the hybrid kids and stuff.
→ {"text": "所以接著我告訴他關於混種孩子之類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

836. But I didn't tell him that I felt that yet.
→ {"text": "但我還沒有告訴他我感覺到了那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

837. It wasn't time.
→ {"text": "時機還沒到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

838. And so I went back to LA.

839. And I actually channeled the kids that I saw that were ours.
→ {"text": "而我實際上通靈看到了那些屬於我們的孩子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "channeled 依據 terminology.yaml"}

840. And there was a boy and a girl.

841. And then I went back two weeks later, and he said that since he had been around me, he had been having these experiences at night where these two kids would come and knock on his door.
→ {"text": "兩週後我回去了，他說自從他在我身邊之後，他一直在夜晚有這些經歷，這兩個孩子會來敲他的門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

846. And it was like, no, don't come in.

847. And at that same time right before I knew that in LA, I tried to tune into the kids.
→ {"text": "當時，我在洛杉磯知道這事之前，我試著與孩子們調頻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

848. And they were like, we don't need to be with you, Mom.

868. But it sounds like these kids can kind of take care of themselves.
