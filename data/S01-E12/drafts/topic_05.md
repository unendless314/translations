## Speaker Group 217

633. [LAUGHS] So getting back to the hybrid children-- because that's your focus right now-- can you tell us how that started, and where are we at?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. Catch us up to speed with the whole children project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

635. Well, how it started was through the mixing of the DNA in the abduction program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. So they would use the human genetics, and then mix it with the Gray genetics, do their stuff, and then create these kids from that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. And there's been different generations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. The first ones were very sickly and didn't make it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. The later ones did make it and are thriving.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

640. And what was the reason for not making it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

641. The reason for not making it was the lack of humanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

642. The lack of humanity?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

643. The lack of nurture, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. It's this idea that science and genetics, and even their energetic know-how of, like, creating an energetic template vessel for incarnation, they could do all of that stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. But when it came down to it, these kids couldn't make it because of a lack of this missing link of love, of like emotion and of connection.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

646. So literally, they went so far in their intellect, that their lack of emotions has-- it's like the missing link that they still, even that far advanced, even that far evolved-- thousands, if not millions of years in the future-- they're missing the one component that we all know creates life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. Doesn't matter--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

648. --what planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

649. --what planet we're in, what religion I guess you are, from what part of humanity you're from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. But we all know in every movie, that's the big lesson in everything in all of our stories, and our religions, and our science fiction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. Everything is love.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. It's all about love.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. So that's the missing link.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

654. That's the missing link.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

655. --that they have forgotten.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

656. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. And the human mothers-- there were some human mothers amongst the fearful scenario of being abducted-- could maintain this love for their alien mutated child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. And nurture them to the degree that they could thrive-- well, could survive, and then eventually thrive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. And so that altered the race.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. And it also altered-- I mean, that was a big shift, I think, even in the human collective, to be able to love.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. I mean, it is your offspring, but to love something alien, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. And it's this mixing that's happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. And much of this is happening in the sub and unconscious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. It's like hidden away memories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. But it is shifting and now translating into the collective consciousness in a really powerful way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

666. I'm just going to mention something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. So actually, I recently saw TED Talks of this autistic boy who-- or at least, he was diagnosed with autism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. And he got over his autism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. And I'll put a link into this video here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. But he actually was able to overcome his autism by love-- his parents loving him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. It wasn't any kind of superfood or anything that they gave him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. He says, I got over the hardships I had because of my parents taking the time to spend the time with me, and be with me, and nurture me, and love me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. And that's what healed these autistic traits that he had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

674. Jeez.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

675. And there's videos of him, like-- it was hardcore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. It was messed up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

677. That's amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

678. So it makes sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

679. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

680. Yeah, it's great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. So now, these children are thriving.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. And what's going on?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. What are they saying?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

684. Well, so now, they're energetically and physically connected to their parents, which are us-- who are us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. And it is their sole motivation to telepathically just inundate us with these memories, and to connect with us in dream time, and to also just implant in us this reality that we've chosen to go towards.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. It's like, OK, go more in this direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. Go more in this direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. So they're really, right now, our guides--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

689. Yeah, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

690. --back to ourselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

691. You know, I'm just thinking about the first humans to arrive on Earth, if they came to this planet in a similar-type fashion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. I wonder if there was that kind of connection to their home world that they had to come in and-- I'm just trying to imagine trying to bring it home, in some way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. So if we can imagine Earth and humans, these first hybrid humans being here and still having, energetically, their parents off world on another planet, and how that connection would happen, it doesn't seem that far out when you start to think of it in those aspects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

694. Well, and it is close to home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. I mean, we're in Sedona.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. But the Phoenix Lights '97, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. Shalanaya mother ship came over--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

698. Wait, Shala--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

699. Shalanaya.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. That's the first hybrid race.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. And they'll be the first ones to land.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

702. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

703. The first hybrid race, but the hybrid kids will be the first to contact beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. And the hybrid kids are on that ship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. Like, some of them live on that actual ship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. And then Shalanaya ships have actually been seen on this property by one of my good friends.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. And so the kids, I mean, they're right there, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. I mean, it's like they're on an airplane or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. Ah, behind the tree.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. I can picture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

711. Peeking around the corner, hey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

712. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

713. Go back to bed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. [LAUGHS] How does this story end?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

715. The story ends, well, kind of how it begins.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. Well, you can see how it ends by the trajectory of how it has started, that I was told that I confirmed that I have hybrid kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. And after that session, about three hybrid moms came up to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. And they already knew that they had kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

719. And at that time, it was very like, whisper about having hybrid kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. It was very like, tucked away and not really outspoken about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. And there were maybe like different abductees who knew about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. But it wasn't like a known out there thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. And that next day, it became very clear that my soul's dedication was to make the hybrid children known.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

724. And so for the rest of that summer, I didn't do anything else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

725. I stopped all other work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

726. And I just started creating the hybrid website for the community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

727. And I started connecting with my kids, because I couldn't connect with anyone else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

728. I didn't even know that I was going to connect other people to their kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

729. I didn't know that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

730. All I was starting with was, like, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

731. I'm the parent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

732. I'm going to start connecting with my children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

733. And I wanted a space to be made for other parents to have this be known, and for it to be findable-- like, for it to be known in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

734. And then later, I found out that I was designed to do that, that there would be those online platforms that people would come to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

735. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

736. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

737. So then, it started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

738. And then, the first month, it was like 100 unique visits.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

739. 100 unique visits?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

740. Per month, to the website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

741. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

742. Just very, very small.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

743. And within a year, it hit 20,000.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

744. So in one year, hybrid alien children went to 20,000.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

745. And now--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

746. Is this the Facebook page?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

747. This is the website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

748. The actual website, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

749. So it's like exponential growth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

750. I'll put a link in here for everybody, so they can see that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

751. Insert link.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

752. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

753. So it's the exponential growth has been the fascinating thing for me to watch, and how a few emails trickle in here and there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

754. And then it's just like, I'm inundated every day with people messaging me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

755. And so the wake up process and the next step, as you were asking, is that people are gonna remember.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

756. People are gonna have dreams about these kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

757. People are gonna have memories about all of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

758. Know the next stages of moving, of the assimilation of moving to these sacred sites.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

759. All of this information is coming and is already happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

760. And I see these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

761. It's amping up in the collective in such a big and powerful way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

762. It's really fun and crazy for even me to watch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

763. Like, I didn't know where this was going.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

764. And so I'm just kind of-- I'm the driver, but I'm also like the observer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 261

765. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

766. It's great to acknowledge that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

767. So your work right now is in addition to working with your own children, you're kind of this conduit, this go-to person for people to connect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

768. And how do you explain your work in that sense?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

769. How do you help people connect with their hybrid children?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

770. I help them connect by, I guess, you can picture it as like a cord, like a plug-in cord-- that, like, I have the cord.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

771. And I just, like, plug it in to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

772. And somehow, I was given the cord.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

773. And it's a kind of a hard cord to find because it's deeply buried in the subconscious and unconscious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

774. So I just connect it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

775. So there's an energetic cording that I connect, that is more of like a astral activity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

776. I don't do it consciously, but it just happens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

777. And then I also bring through-- I get the clairvoyant image of the child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

778. Or they talk to me through all the different senses that I perceive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

779. And I deliver whatever messages, deliver about their essence, deliver their image-- whatever the parent needs to know that's going to benefit them in the next stage of their connection with their child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

780. That's what I bring through.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

781. Excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

782. And for every person, it's a different message, I assume.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

783. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

784. It's very different, and it could be things that they might not want to hear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

785. Well, for example, has anybody not received the information very well?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

786. In what case when you say, not what they want to hear?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

787. Well, I guess, maybe that wasn't even accurate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

788. Because every person-- I've probably done about 50 in the past few years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

789. And every person has completely-- like, it's really hit them on a very deep level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

790. And they've all resonated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

791. Maybe the not what they want to hear is the shifting that they need to do to be able to meet them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

792. Because it's not like you can just stay at your 9:00 to 5:00 job, like, chowing down on a burger, and, like, they're going to move into your house in the neighborhood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

793. So, explain, for example, what are some of the shifts that need to take place?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

794. Some of the shifts that need to take place are, one is for the human parents to follow their excitement-- to, like, really align themselves with their passion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

795. Because only in that state will they be able to shift to where they can actually meet them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

796. So one is the transition to having them be more themselves, which is a lot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

797. In some cases, it could be visiting certain places, that they need to go visit certain places to make a certain connection.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

798. They might need to go to a sacred site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

799. They might need to move to a different place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

800. And the children actually come through and say this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

801. Yeah, in some cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

802. I use my own filter in the way of knowing how much is too much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

803. Because the kid would push them all the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

804. The kid is like, go, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

805. You look at the person and you're like, where they're at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

806. And you're like, OK, are they resonating with this information?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

807. Or are they are they taking steps back?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

808. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

809. So I give as much as is going to be helpful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

810. Because if say, like, give up your whole life and go to Tibet--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

811. Then they're going to throw the whole out not listen to any of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

812. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

813. And the kid understands that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

814. And I have dialogues with them too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

815. Do they knock on your door afterwards and say, why didn't you tell them this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

816. Or, why didn't you tell them that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

817. And then you say, well, because this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

818. And they say, oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

819. Do you do have those kind of?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

820. Kind of, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

821. The kind of conversation, how it goes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

822. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

823. So I'll give you a scenario.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

824. One of my childhood friends-- well, our families were friends, I met him maybe once when I was, like, five.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

825. And I never met him, but we always knew about each other-- similar age.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

826. And he's an artist too, very creative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

827. And finally, there was something when this hybrid children thing started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

828. It was like, you need to go back to Utah and connect with this guy that I had never met in person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

829. And so we connected.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

830. And within 10 minutes, he starts telling me about these things-- abduction experiences that started happening right when he hit puberty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

831. I'm like, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

832. I knew that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

833. And I very quickly heard and felt that he had these hybrid kids, and that we particularly had hybrid kids together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

834. And we were just friends and stuff, but they used our genetic material together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

835. And so then I told him about the hybrid kids and stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

836. But I didn't tell him that I felt that yet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

837. It wasn't time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

838. And so I went back to LA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

839. And I actually channeled the kids that I saw that were ours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

840. And there was a boy and a girl.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

841. And then I went back two weeks later, and he said that since he had been around me, he had been having these experiences at night where these two kids would come and knock on his door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

842. And every night that week, his dog had been needing to go out at night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

843. And he would go into this kind of dream state.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

844. And these kids, like, who he was terrified of, would just knock on his door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

845. And he had these dreams of, like, pushing the door shut as these kids were trying to get in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

846. And it was like, no, don't come in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

847. And at that same time right before I knew that in LA, I tried to tune into the kids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

848. And they were like, we don't need to be with you, Mom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

849. Like, we need to take care of Dad.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

850. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

851. So all of this was happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

852. And like, it was confirmed by him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

853. So there are some people that, they're just like--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

854. They're not ready for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

855. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

856. No, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

857. Well, after our session, it's a lot to throw on you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

858. It's like all day yesterday, I kept talking to Daniel-- my cameraman here-- about, like, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

859. Maybe I don't know if I'm ready for real kids here in this third dimension.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

860. But I might be ready for--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

861. --for an alien.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

862. --for an alien kid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

863. [LAUGHS] As crazy as that sounds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

864. So yeah, I guess most people would kind of the other way around.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

865. Even if you had regular kids on this dimension, even contemplating another kid, that's like a major--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

866. It's a major thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

867. That's a thing that you just, like-- I don't need that worry/responsibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

868. But it sounds like these kids can kind of take care of themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

869. If they're guiding us along, they're more of the parents, and we're the kids, in many aspects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

870. But do they have basic needs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

871. Do they need to be potty trained?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

872. How does that work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

873. Their caretakers, the other ETs that they're with, they're taking care of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

874. They're getting them up to speed with how to lift up the toilet seat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

875. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

876. They're being trained for Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

877. That's their classroom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

878. So they don't go to school, they go to like Earth 101, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

879. Which I've actually talked to several abductees who--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

880. --the classroom?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

881. --or even, yeah, the classroom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

882. And they're on ships.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

883. And they see classrooms where they're teaching them how to buy stuff at the supermarket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

884. And it's like-- and I heard that like three to five years ago, abductees talking about this and having the same.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

885. And it's not just one, but several of these abductees saying, hey, I was on a ship, and I saw that too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

886. And that's so bizarre.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

887. What does that mean?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

888. It means there's something coming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

889. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

890. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

891. So it looks like all the dots are getting connected here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

892. Something's coming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

893. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

894. So is that what's going to happen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

895. Are they going to join us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

896. You said they're in another dimension on another planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

897. Are they going to join us here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

898. Yes, they are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

899. That's the grand plan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

900. The Freelancers are going to join us on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

901. So the other civilizations, they're on their civilizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

902. But there were kids that were held out of time, in a sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

903. So they're not aging.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

904. They're just, like, held in time-- continuing on, but they're going to be inserted into our reality when the time is right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

905. And they will be introduced to Earth as our children.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

906. And they will be the first step and conduit into contact with other civilizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

907. Right, which makes it a little easier on humanity if there's an actual alien that is part human--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

908. --and their child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

909. --and their child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

910. --and is a child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

911. --and is a child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

912. So you're not going to blow it out of the sky, or we're being attacked by aliens!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

913. How can kids be attacking us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

914. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
