433. Again, where we're going with all this, getting back to that, it seems like humans are going to have-- maybe not the way the Annunaki had originally intended, but we still are going to have a strong presence in this galaxy.
→ {"text": "再次回到這個話題，看起來人類將會在這個銀河系中佔有重要地位——也許不是阿努納奇最初預期的方式，但我們仍然會有強大的存在感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

434. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. That is key to, say, teaching, because you have entered into the 3D world that has benefited you greatly in understanding and learning in a subconscious way.
→ {"text": "這就是關鍵所在——可以說是「教導」的關鍵，因為你們進入了3維世界，這讓你們在潛意識層面獲得了巨大的理解與學習。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. And now that you are fully awakening and becoming conscious, you now can become the teachers and allowing others to understand their full capacity.
→ {"text": "而現在，當你們完全覺醒並變得有意識時，你們就能成為教師，讓其他物種理解他們的全部潛能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. So in a sense, it has been very beneficial for you to experience the world in the way that you have.
→ {"text": "所以從某種意義上來說，以你們經歷的方式體驗這個世界，對你們而言是非常有益的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. It has been-- she says, what we have called an excellent simulation of learning.
→ {"text": "她說，這一直是——我們稱之為一場優秀的學習模擬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

439. Mm.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. And these other races that are part of us that are observing humanity now, and have been, I'm assuming they're learning a lot just by the observation process.
→ {"text": "而那些構成我們一部分的其他種族，一直在觀察著人類，我猜測他們光是透過觀察就學到了很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

441. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. They've realized a lot of their mistakes because of how we've dealt with what they've taught us.
→ {"text": "他們已經意識到自己許多錯誤，因為看到我們如何處理他們教導我們的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. And they have evolved because of it, because they are working to undo some of this, and expanding themselves into other areas of thinking.
→ {"text": "他們因此而演化了，因為他們正在努力修正其中一些問題，並將自己擴展到其他思維領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. She says, initially, it was done to protect the human race, the human species, the DNA that was created, these type of things, and to let you have the best life possible.
→ {"text": "她說，最初的目的是為了保護人類種族、人類物種、被創造的DNA，諸如此類的事物，並讓你們擁有最好的生活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. But of course, things transpired the way they did, where beings took over consciousness.
→ {"text": "但當然，事情還是發生了，意識被某些存有接管了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. And they see both perspectives.
→ {"text": "他們看到了雙方的觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. And that is important in expansion.
→ {"text": "而這對擴展而言是重要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

449. When you say beings took over consciousness, is this the integration of the downgrade into third density?
→ {"text": "當你說意識被存有接管時，這是指整合進入第三密度的降級嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

450. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. She says it's back into the serpent race, which is not necessarily the serpent, but beings that wanted to take over consciousness.
→ {"text": "她說這又回到了蛇族，但不一定是蛇的形態，而是那些想要接管意識的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. And then now you have lower dimensional Reptilians that-- she says, and others.
→ {"text": "然後現在你們有低維度的爬蟲人——她說，還有其他存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. She didn't want me to limit it to that.
→ {"text": "她不希望我把範圍侷限於此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. But others that like to maintain control over the consciousness.
→ {"text": "還有其他喜歡維持對意識控制的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

455. And because of the energy where we're at in our evolution, that was sort of an easy gateway into that?
→ {"text": "而因為我們進化所處的能量狀態，那算是一個容易進入的門戶嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

456. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. They understood the cycle of the planet.
→ {"text": "他們理解地球的週期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. They understood that when the planet cycled in a particular way, that it opened a gateway-- as you spoke of-- to enter into lower consciousness.
→ {"text": "他們理解當地球以特定方式循環時，就會打開一個門戶——正如你所說的——讓低意識得以進入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. And the Annunaki and higher beings of dimensions were forced to leave because they could not re-enter in the same way that they w-- they were not able to appear to humans like they had before, and guide them.
→ {"text": "而阿努納奇和更高維度的存有被迫離開，因為他們無法再以同樣的方式重新進入——他們無法像以前那樣在人類面前現身並引導他們了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. Everything was subconscious, she said, at that point.
→ {"text": "她說，在那個時候，一切都只能在潛意識中進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

461. So almost like getting contact now, for many of us who are having dream experiences.
→ {"text": "所以幾乎就像現在許多人透過夢境體驗獲得接觸一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. When things become too dense, then that's really the only gateway in.
→ {"text": "當事物變得太稠密時，那真的就是唯一的進入門戶了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. Where, maybe on some parts of the Earth, where the actual physical area is in a higher frequency, then those can be gateways of-- doorways in for higher dimensional beings, physically.
→ {"text": "而在地球的某些地方，實際的物理區域處於更高的頻率，那麼這些地方就可以成為門戶——讓更高維度的存有以物理形式進入的門戶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

464. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. And also consider, there were several attempts before this transition, while we were making contact with you with the humans to try to pull them out of this sort of mindset that they were getting taken or putting a hold on to.
→ {"text": "而且也要考慮到，在這次轉變之前，當我們與人類保持接觸時，曾經有過幾次嘗試，試圖將他們從那種正在被接管或執著不放的心態中拉出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. But the humans wouldn't allow it.
→ {"text": "但人類不願意接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. They still worshipped the gods that led them into avenues that were unbeneficial.
→ {"text": "他們仍然崇拜那些將他們引向無益道路的神祇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. They still desired trade and money over spiritual things at this point, and we could not reach them.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，他們仍然渴望貿易和金錢，而非靈性事物，我們無法觸及他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. She says, so we were asked to leave by the consciousness, basically.
→ {"text": "她說，所以基本上，我們是被意識要求離開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

470. So it was our own doing.
→ {"text": "所以這是我們自己造成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. Wasn't an outside source.
→ {"text": "不是外在的源頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. I mean, it wasn't out--
→ {"text": "我是說，這不是外——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

473. She says, in a sense, but you had helped to push you along.
→ {"text": "她說，從某種意義上來說是，但有存有幫助推動了你們。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "you had helped 可能指其他存有幫助推動人類朝這個方向發展"}

474. You had the choice all along, though.
→ {"text": "不過，你們一直都有選擇權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

475. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. Do we always have-- we always have that choice initially, don't we?
→ {"text": "我們是否總是擁有——我們最初總是擁有那個選擇權，不是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

477. She says yes, but it can be very, very difficult.
→ {"text": "她說是的，但這可能非常、非常困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

478. But now, it seems the choice-- that doorway has come to us again, and now-- at least the timeline I choose to be in, it seems that we are making that choice to let in our higher frequency brothers and sisters come in--
→ {"text": "但現在，看起來那個選擇——那扇門再次來到我們面前，而現在——至少在我選擇身處的時間線上，我們似乎正在做出那個選擇，讓我們更高頻率的兄弟姐妹進入——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

479. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

480. --and make the shift the other direction, because we've--
→ {"text": "——並朝另一個方向進行轉變，因為我們已經——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

481. She says many of us are wanting and hoping to come back in the same way that we had that contact with you prior.
→ {"text": "她說，我們許多人都希望能以之前與你們建立接觸的同樣方式回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. And we're hoping that you remember that some part of your consciousness remembers that you once had had contact in that similar way, and that everything was OK.
→ {"text": "我們希望你們記得，希望你們意識的某部分能記起你們曾經以類似的方式建立過接觸，而且一切都很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

483. Was the last gateway for this energy, was this back in the Egyptian days?
→ {"text": "這種能量的最後門戶，是在埃及時代嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

484. I feel like she's showing me Rome.
→ {"text": "我感覺她在展示給我看羅馬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. There was a gateway in Rome, and--
→ {"text": "在羅馬有個門戶，而且——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

486. In Rome.
→ {"text": "在羅馬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

488. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. I don't know what year's the are, but I feel like it's further-- so would it be Brutus, I think, is what she's saying?
→ {"text": "我不知道具體是哪一年，但我感覺是更晚一些——我想她說的是布魯圖斯時期嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. Brutus and Augustus, I think.
→ {"text": "我想是布魯圖斯和奧古斯都時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. Which is--
→ {"text": "那是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

492. By the way, I totally failed history.
→ {"text": "順便說一下，我歷史完全不及格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. [CHUCKLING]
→ {"text": "【輕笑】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

494. It's like 100 AD.
→ {"text": "大概是公元100年左右。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

495. I think I know why I too, because I was just not interested.
→ {"text": "我想我也知道為什麼了，因為我當時就是不感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. Now it's interesting.
→ {"text": "現在倒是有趣了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

497. I think, though, based on other channelings-- I'm just going to step aside from her for a sec-- Christ consciousness was one of the last hopes to try to bring that out of people and understand their power.
→ {"text": "不過我認為，根據其他通靈訊息——我暫時先離開她一下——基督意識是試圖喚醒人們並讓他們理解自身力量的最後希望之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

498. Oh, OK. I see.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

500. And there was a lot of ET interaction at the time, and a lot of beings still coming as angelic forms.
→ {"text": "而且在那個時候有大量的外星互動，許多存有仍然以天使形態到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. And then shortly after that, there was the close of the gateways, like you talked about.
→ {"text": "然後在那之後不久，就像你說的，門戶關閉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

502. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. And then probably prior to that would have been Egyptian days, yeah.
→ {"text": "然後在那之前應該就是埃及時代了，對吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

504. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

505. And what role did the Buddha energy on the planet take?
→ {"text": "那麼佛陀能量在地球上扮演了什麼角色？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. Because that was slightly before Christ, but after the Egyptian era.
→ {"text": "因為那是在基督之前不久，但在埃及時代之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

507. She says to bring peace.
→ {"text": "她說是為了帶來平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

508. Peace within the self.
→ {"text": "內在的平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. Connection within the self.
→ {"text": "與自我的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. Also a preparation for what was to come.
→ {"text": "也是為即將到來的事情做準備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. To be able to match up to what not only Christ consciousness, she says, but the one last loop to understand what the human was capable of.
→ {"text": "她說，這不僅是為了與基督意識相匹配，也是最後一次循環，為了理解人類的能力所在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

512. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. The one last loop.
→ {"text": "最後一次循環。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. Could you--
→ {"text": "你能不能——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

515. She says like what we spoke of before.
→ {"text": "她說就像我們之前說過的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. Before that gateway was closing, they anticipated the close shortly after Christ's death.
→ {"text": "在那個門戶關閉之前，他們預料到基督死後不久門戶就會關閉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

517. So this was so-- it was like a pre-dimensional door opening to prep people to--
→ {"text": "所以這是——就像是一次預先的維度門戶開啟，為了讓人們做好準備來——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

518. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. It sounds like it was a time for peace, and to prep.
→ {"text": "聽起來那是一段平靜的時期，也是為了準備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

520. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

521. She says, to help turn off the program for moments of time.
→ {"text": "她說，為了幫助在某些時刻關閉程式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

522. Mm.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. And in the Tibetan energy, there's the Buddhist influence now.
→ {"text": "而在西藏能量中，現在有佛教的影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. But it seems like there's more ancient stuff going on there prior to Buddha's influence.
→ {"text": "但似乎在佛陀影響之前，那裡還有更古老的事物在運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

525. What kind of gateway are we looking at there?
→ {"text": "我們在那裡看到的是什麼樣的門戶？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

526. She's just showing me a lot of visuals with African.
→ {"text": "她只是在展示給我看很多與非洲有關的畫面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

527. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

528. I don't know how that correlates.
→ {"text": "我不知道那是如何關聯的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. Let me see if I can get her to just tell me.
→ {"text": "讓我看看能不能讓她直接告訴我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. There just seems to be a correlation with some type of tribe in Africa that branched off somehow.
→ {"text": "似乎就是與非洲的某種部落有關聯，那個部落以某種方式分支出去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. I don't know.
→ {"text": "我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. It might be beyond my library of understanding.
→ {"text": "這可能超出了我的理解範圍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

533. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
