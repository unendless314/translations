223. She says, let's call them the serpent species.
→ {"text": "她說，我們可以稱他們為蛇族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

224. Yes.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. OK.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

226. But this doesn't necessarily mean that they are Reptoid in nature.
→ {"text": "但這不代表他們在本質上一定是爬蟲族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. It means that they are of the serpent star system.
→ {"text": "意思是他們來自蛇星系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. I'm asking her if it's like that Alpha Draconis.
→ {"text": "我問她是不是像天龍座α星那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

229. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

230. She says yes, but it's also bigger.
→ {"text": "她說對，但也更大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. Something that the ancients knew of.
→ {"text": "是古人所知道的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. They called it the serpent star system, basically.
→ {"text": "基本上，他們稱之為蛇星系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. And there was a serpent species because they came from that location.
→ {"text": "而之所以稱為蛇族，是因為他們來自那個地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. I'm asking her to give me a linear time of when the consciousness transitioned.
→ {"text": "我正在請她給我一個線性時間，說明意識是何時轉變的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. And she's just showing me a lot of dragon stuff, and I'm not understanding.
→ {"text": "而她只是顯示給我看很多龍的東西，我不太理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. Let's see if I can get her to give me numbers.
→ {"text": "我來試試能不能讓她給我具體數字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. She's not giving me a time period of when consciousness really changed.
→ {"text": "她並沒有給我意識真正改變的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. I feel like it might be such a slow process that it's hard to give a date.
→ {"text": "我覺得這可能是一個非常緩慢的過程，難以給出日期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

239. Sure, sure.
→ {"text": "當然，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Was the Annunaki intervention pre-dinosaur era, or after?
→ {"text": "阿努納奇的介入是在恐龍時代之前還是之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

241. I want to say pre.
→ {"text": "我想說是之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

242. She says, but it also depends on the regions.
→ {"text": "她說，但這也取決於區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Some regions didn't inhabit the beings-- and she's referring to the dinosaurs-- for quite some time.
→ {"text": "有些區域在相當長一段時間內並沒有這些生物——她指的是恐龍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. And even then, more humans were able to occupy the area, or land dominated species.
→ {"text": "而即便如此，更多的人類還是能夠占據這些地區，或者說陸地主導的物種。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意略微不清，但理解為人類能夠占據某些區域"}


## Speaker Group 81

245. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. So were dinosaurs more of human's natural evolution?
→ {"text": "所以恐龍更像是人類的自然演化嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Or was their genetic manipulation with the dinosaurs coming to Earth?
→ {"text": "還是說恐龍來到地球時就有基因操控？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

248. OK, I'm asking her to slow down.
→ {"text": "好，我請她慢下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. There was some natural evolution process with the dinosaur species, but it basically was put forth on the surface to start as a testing point to see what type of species could survive, what type of evolution would occur on its own, what type of things need to tampering in order to survive these type of things.
→ {"text": "恐龍物種確實有一些自然演化過程，但基本上牠們被放到地表是作為一個測試點，看看什麼樣的物種能夠存活、什麼樣的演化會自然發生、什麼樣的東西需要干預才能存活這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. She says, and this is why we say that time periods are difficult, because there were areas where dinosaurs were only able to survive for a brief time, other places where they were able to survive and thrive quite freely.
→ {"text": "她說，這就是為什麼我們說時期很難界定，因為有些地區恐龍只能存活很短的時間，其他地方則能夠相當自由地生存和繁榮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. And so the areas and the regions helped dictate the time period, as well as where humans were able to go.
→ {"text": "所以地區和區域幫助決定了時期，以及人類能夠前往的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

252. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. And I assume that's the same for humans too.
→ {"text": "我猜人類也是一樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Different pockets of humans, different areas, could survive longer.
→ {"text": "不同地區的人類群體，在不同的區域能存活更久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

255. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. That's very good to think that, because in different regions, your genetic genome needed certain, she says-- I might call it upgrades in order for you to survive.
→ {"text": "這樣想非常好，因為在不同區域，你們的基因組需要某些，她說——我可以稱之為升級，以便你們能夠存活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. In order for you to think, or to have the ability within your body to survive longer than needed.
→ {"text": "為了讓你們能夠思考，或者讓你們的身體有能力存活得比所需的時間更長。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意略微模糊"}


## Speaker Group 85

258. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. So getting back to the Atlantean Annunaki karma, then the dinosaur karma, is it true, as our scientists are figuring out, that an asteroid created the extinction event on planet Earth, the reset for the dinosaurs?
→ {"text": "所以回到亞特蘭提斯和阿努納奇的業力，以及恐龍的業力，我們的科學家正在研究的，是不是真的有一顆小行星造成了地球上的滅絕事件，重置了恐龍？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

260. She says, we think that they are on the right path.
→ {"text": "她說，我們認為他們走在正確的道路上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Obviously, there is a little bit more to it.
→ {"text": "顯然，還有更多細節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. There were chemicals that were set forth to create fires and erosion-- I feel like maybe that could be earthquakes--
→ {"text": "有一些化學物質被釋放出來，造成火災和侵蝕——我感覺可能是地震——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

263. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

264. --in order to offset the species.
→ {"text": "——為了抵消這個物種。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "offset可能指重置或消除該物種"}


## Speaker Group 89

265. To reset things a little bit?
→ {"text": "要稍微重置一下？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

266. With the dinosaurs specifically is what she's showing me.
→ {"text": "她顯示給我看的特別是關於恐龍的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. I feel like there's a couple different times when this happened, based on what she's showing me.
→ {"text": "根據她顯示給我看的，我感覺這發生過幾次不同的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

268. So maybe more than one extinction event.
→ {"text": "所以可能不只一次滅絕事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

269. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. And this one doesn't seem to do with water.
→ {"text": "而這次似乎與水無關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. It seems to do more with gases and fire.
→ {"text": "似乎更多與氣體和火有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. There's a lot of burning around the regions that she's showing me, and earthquakes.
→ {"text": "她顯示給我看的區域有大量燃燒，還有地震。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

273. And I understand that all this is for different evolution-- for the evolution of various species, and animals, plants, humanoids, dinosaurs, et cetera.
→ {"text": "我理解這一切都是為了不同的演化——各種物種、動物、植物、類人生物、恐龍等等的演化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. Why does the Earth itself need to have all this stuff going on?
→ {"text": "為什麼地球本身需要經歷這一切？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. What is it getting out of all this?
→ {"text": "它從中得到了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

276. She's saying that it just has to go through its own planetary cycle, just as a cell would gain expansion, or she says maybe what you would call evolution, through going through a little bit of stress.
→ {"text": "她說它只是必須經歷自己的行星週期，就像一個細胞會透過經歷一點壓力來獲得擴展，或者她說也許你們會稱之為演化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. Strain and division, these kind of things, it's just part of the way she says the universe works.
→ {"text": "張力和分裂，這類事情，她說這只是宇宙運作方式的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

278. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

279. It isn't to hurt Gaia, she says.
→ {"text": "她說，這並不是要傷害蓋亞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. It's to help it transition, and to reach into higher consciousness.
→ {"text": "而是要幫助它轉變，並達到更高的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. Many of other planets do the same.
→ {"text": "許多其他行星也在做同樣的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

282. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Just to go back to our history a little bit more, then, and the different energies and beings. These other races, this borrowed DNA that we were created from, did they-- I'm assuming they also signed up for that.
→ {"text": "那麼，稍微回到我們的歷史，以及不同的能量和存有。這些其他種族，我們被創造時所借用的 DNA，他們是——我猜他們也簽署了這個協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. Loaning their DNA.
→ {"text": "出借他們的 DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. What was their intention?
→ {"text": "他們的意圖是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. What were, say, the Pleiades' intention, and Reptilians, at that time?
→ {"text": "比如說，昴宿星人和爬蟲人當時的意圖是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. Or Zeta.
→ {"text": "或是齊塔人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. Do we have Zeta DNA?
→ {"text": "我們有齊塔DNA嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

289. She's saying no, not the Annunaki creation.
→ {"text": "她說沒有，在阿努納奇的創造中沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. Perhaps in a roundabout way, as Zeta DNA can be shared in a roundabout way with other species.
→ {"text": "也許是以間接方式，因為齊塔DNA可以透過間接方式與其他物種共享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. But you have not been transplanted with their direct DNA.
→ {"text": "但你們並沒有被植入他們的直接DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. But there had been multiple experimentations on the Zetas' part prior to the Annunaki taking control.
→ {"text": "但在阿努納奇接管之前，齊塔人那邊已經進行過多次實驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

293. Oh, interesting.
→ {"text": "哦，有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

294. She says, to answer the question about the DNA exchange, they were all to be a part of the interactions, and all to share it, and have their regions accordingly to-- she says maybe what you call family.
→ {"text": "她說，要回答關於DNA交換的問題，他們都要參與互動，都要分享，並根據——她說也許你們會稱之為家族——擁有他們的區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. For example, let's say that a family from the Pleiades had a region to control and dominate on the Earth's surface.
→ {"text": "例如，假設來自昴宿星的一個家族在地球表面有一個區域可以控制和支配。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. And a Reptilian would have an area.
→ {"text": "而爬蟲人會有一個區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. She says the Insectoids that we speak of, they were mixed in.
→ {"text": "她說我們提到的昆蟲族，他們也混合在其中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. There was a mixture.
→ {"text": "有一種混合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. They were in agreement to divide, dominate, and to be in their regions.
→ {"text": "他們同意劃分、支配，並待在各自的區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. And this also remains still up into the galaxies as well as Earth.
→ {"text": "這在銀河系以及地球上仍然存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. It was a contract for, she says, like the souls.
→ {"text": "她說，這是一種契約，就像靈魂的契約。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. They agreed upon it.
→ {"text": "他們同意了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. There was no good or bad.
→ {"text": "沒有好壞之分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. There was just-- she says it was almost like a big family.
→ {"text": "只是——她說這幾乎就像一個大家庭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

305. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. So to create a place, a meeting ground to mix the energy so we can get along better.
→ {"text": "所以是為了創造一個地方，一個會面場所來混合能量，這樣我們就能相處得更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

307. Yeah, well, what's the intent?
→ {"text": "是啊，那意圖是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. The intent, she says, to create.
→ {"text": "她說，意圖就是創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

309. Just to create.
→ {"text": "就是為了創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

310. Just to be godlike, to create something.
→ {"text": "就是要像神一樣，創造某種東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. But they needed other DNA.
→ {"text": "但他們需要其他的DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. They couldn't do it solely with one DNA on the surface of Earth.
→ {"text": "他們無法單獨用一種DNA在地球表面做到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. It wasn't applicable.
→ {"text": "那是不可行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

314. So the Earth environment itself is pretty unique, then, in the galaxy?
→ {"text": "所以地球環境本身在銀河系中相當獨特？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

315. She says, in this instance, yes.
→ {"text": "她說，在這種情況下，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. They needed multiple types of DNA.
→ {"text": "他們需要多種類型的DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Even mammalian.
→ {"text": "甚至哺乳動物的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. Mammalian was used.
→ {"text": "哺乳動物的DNA被使用了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. But it was understood that only-- she's showing me leaders.
→ {"text": "但大家理解只有——她在顯示給我看領袖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. That there would only be a certain group of leaders for this.
→ {"text": "為此只會有特定的一群領袖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. So they did the exchange accordingly.
→ {"text": "所以他們相應地進行了交換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. She's saying that part of also the exchange was for the leaders to not inhibit certain parts of the planet if they could exchange the DNA, and they would be protected, if that makes sense, in regions.
→ {"text": "她說，交換的一部分也包括，如果領袖們能夠交換DNA，他們就不會占據行星的某些部分，並且他們會在各自區域受到保護，如果這說得通的話。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意略複雜，理解為不占據某些區域以換取保護"}


## Speaker Group 107

323. The regions would be protected.
→ {"text": "這些區域會受到保護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

324. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

325. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

326. I feel like I-- she's showing me a lot of dolphins and mammalians in the waters.
→ {"text": "我感覺——她在顯示給我看很多海豚和水中的哺乳動物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. They were not to dominate the waters in the way that they did the land.
→ {"text": "他們不像支配陸地那樣支配水域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. And for that, they could exchange DNA.
→ {"text": "為此，他們可以交換DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. So there were these contracts and agreements.
→ {"text": "所以有這些契約和協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

330. So that would be the Sirian energy?
→ {"text": "所以那是天狼星能量？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

331. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

332. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
