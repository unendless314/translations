601. And then beings were able to come through that.

## Speaker Group 207

605. OK.

606. Based on what she was saying, there's something to do with teleportation and mining with those beings, as far as what I asked about the role.
→ {"text": "根據她所說的，就我所問的角色而言，與那些存有有關的是傳送和採礦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. Timelines, I'm not sure about.

608. I feel like they're earlier than-- she's showing me before the first people along the Aztec.
→ {"text": "我感覺他們更早——她向我展示的是在阿茲特克最早的人之前。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

609. So there was different timelines for Aztec people, and the Mayans, prior to that.
→ {"text": "所以阿茲特克人和瑪雅人有不同的時間線，在那之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. So I don't know how that all plays in to history.
→ {"text": "所以我不知道這一切如何融入歷史。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. I feel like she's even showing me that it's even before the humanoid was even built.

612. I feel like it's before-- yeah.

616. Just right after, to assist the teleportation devices.

## Speaker Group 211

617. They were assisting the Annunaki?
→ {"text": "他們在協助阿努納奇？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

618. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. They were given land rights for assistance because they had certain knowledge of teleportation that the Annunaki needed help with.
→ {"text": "他們因為協助而被賦予土地使用權，因為他們有阿努納奇需要幫助的某些傳送知識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. She says, or we could even just say beings on the planet, because not all of them were creating the human at that time.
→ {"text": "她說，或者我們甚至可以說是地球上的存有，因為當時不是所有存有都在創造人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. There were other beings that could come, but the Annunaki established Earth as their planet for the long run, and so created the human to establish their domain.
→ {"text": "有其他存有可以來，但阿努納奇將地球確立為他們長期的星球，所以創造了人類來建立他們的領地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. But other beings were coming and going at that time, and this was one of them.
→ {"text": "但當時其他存有也在來來去去，這些三指生物就是其中之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

623. When did the quote unquote quarantine-- that, let's say, loose term we use for these beings to stop coming--
→ {"text": "所謂的「隔離」什麼時候開始的——就是說，我們用這個寬鬆的術語來指這些存有停止前來——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

624. So she says that there are two parts to that question.
→ {"text": "她說這個問題有兩個部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

625. She's saying that she's giving me the 1950s, 1960s, that there were some more rules put in place with actual visitations.
→ {"text": "她說，她給我的時間點是1950年代、1960年代，在實際訪問方面有一些更多的規則被設立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

626. But then, going back to where we could physically see them on a day-to-day like we were talking about, that is in the Roman time period when things transitioned.
→ {"text": "但是，回到我們之前談到的那種可以日常實際看到他們的狀況，那是在羅馬時期發生轉變的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

627. Oh, so prior to the Roman era, there was more ET--
→ {"text": "哦，所以在羅馬時代之前，有更多的外星——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

628. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

629. So-- >> --traffic?
→ {"text": "所以——>> ——往來？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

630. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. [CHUCKLING] So let me see if I can get her to-- about 100 to 200 years after what we know as Christ's death, that's when things transitioned where there were no more visitations from light beings in this quite the same way.
→ {"text": "【輕笑】讓我看看能不能讓她——大約在我們所知的基督死後100到200年，那時事情發生了轉變，光之存有不再以同樣的方式前來訪問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

632. She says, but when you speak of visitations from other planets-- like we spoke of other beings just coming-- there were more stricter guidelines put in place, she says, after the 1950s into the 1960s.
→ {"text": "她說，但當你談到來自其他行星的訪問——就像我們說的其他存有只是前來——她說，在1950年代到1960年代之後，有更嚴格的指導方針被設立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

633. Is that because we had such a flux of ET activity after the nuclear bombs?
→ {"text": "那是因為我們在核彈之後有這麼多的外星活動湧入嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

634. I'm asking her why that is and she's showing me the presidents.
→ {"text": "我問她為什麼，她讓我看到總統們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. She's showing me the president had some-- OK, there's also some from other countries.
→ {"text": "她讓我看到總統有一些——好，也有一些來自其他國家的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. She's showing me they basically-- I don't know how it all went down, but there were some rules put into place.
→ {"text": "她讓我看到他們基本上——我不知道一切是怎麼發生的，但有一些規則被設立了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. She's saying that Earth has been quarantined in different ways at several different times.
→ {"text": "她說地球在幾個不同的時期以不同的方式被隔離過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. And because of what we spoke of prior, the light beings were not able to come visit the humans in quite the same way because it had dropped down into lower density.
→ {"text": "而且因為我們之前談到的原因，光之存有無法以同樣的方式來訪問人類，因為它已經降到低密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. And then, as you speak of other density beings that could resonate with a similar frequency on Earth and come down and make some type of contact were forbidden.
→ {"text": "然後，正如你所說的其他密度存有，那些能夠與地球相似頻率共振、降臨並建立某種接觸的，被禁止了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

640. And the threat was, if they continued, more chemical use would be chosen.
→ {"text": "威脅是，如果他們繼續，將選擇使用更多的化學武器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

641. So it's kind of been a trade, then, on both sides for, OK, we won't intervene if you don't intervene.
→ {"text": "所以這就像是雙方的一種交易，好，我們不干預，你們也不要干預。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

642. [CHUCKLES]
→ {"text": "【笑聲】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

643. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

644. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

645. She says it was like, don't bother us.
→ {"text": "她說那就像是，別來煩我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. If you do, more chemicals will be expelled.
→ {"text": "如果你們這麼做，將釋放更多化學武器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. I'm asking her how did that happen, though.
→ {"text": "不過我在問她那是怎麼發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. She just said communication lines.
→ {"text": "她剛說通訊管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

649. However they're communicating.
→ {"text": "無論他們是怎麼通訊的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

650. You mean, how did these agreements come through?
→ {"text": "你的意思是，這些協議是怎麼達成的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

651. Yeah, as far as with our governments.
→ {"text": "對，就我們政府而言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. How did that all happen?
→ {"text": "這一切是怎麼發生的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

653. She says through communication lines.
→ {"text": "她說透過通訊管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. So I would assume that might not be face to face, but however they communicate.
→ {"text": "所以我猜那可能不是面對面的，而是用他們通訊的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

655. Sure, sure.
→ {"text": "當然，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. Now, more people are having experiences, and interactions, and dreamtime experiences.
→ {"text": "現在，越來越多人有各種體驗、互動和夢境體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. Are we at another gateway, or was 2012 one of these gateways?
→ {"text": "我們現在是在另一個門戶，還是2012就是這些門戶之一？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

658. OK, so she's nodding yes to 2012.
→ {"text": "好，她對2012點頭表示是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. It was the start of the opening, she says.
→ {"text": "她說，那是開啟的開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. The door knob turning and opening was what 2012 was.
→ {"text": "2012就是門把轉動並開啟的時刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. And now we are slowly pushing that door open more and more.
→ {"text": "而現在我們正慢慢地越來越推開那扇門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. And then she visually showed me the door opening with the visual of several different kinds of beings, and that's where the hope is, to open that door to a point where we can visually see them once again.
→ {"text": "然後她視覺化地向我展示門打開的畫面，伴隨著幾種不同類型的存有，這就是希望所在，將那扇門打開到我們能再次親眼看見他們的程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. She says, and have contact and visual experiences as we once had.
→ {"text": "她說，並且像我們曾經擁有的那樣有接觸和視覺體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. Can see tell us about the hybrid children?
→ {"text": "她能告訴我們關於混種孩童的事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. She says there are several different programs of hybridization Which one which one?
→ {"text": "她說有幾個不同的混種計畫，哪一個，哪一個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

666. The Zetas?
→ {"text": "齊塔人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

667. She says the Zeta star system has been incorporated or Interacted with your Earth for quite some time.
→ {"text": "她說齊塔星系已經融入或與你們的地球互動了相當長的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. They have not been so benevolent.
→ {"text": "他們並不是那麼仁慈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. But yet they have brought many benefits to the human species such as sciences and mathematical reasoning, these type of things, and they also work well with other beings that have brought this, so you can say the interaction has been beneficial to have their type of species along the Earth for a time.
→ {"text": "但他們確實為人類物種帶來許多好處，比如科學和數學推理這類東西，而且他們也與其他帶來這些的存有合作得很好，所以你可以說，讓他們這類物種在地球上存在一段時間，這種互動是有益的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. What we have found is they are unable to reproduce and they are in need of DNA exchange, and so there have been interactions as such she says.
→ {"text": "她說，我們發現的是他們無法繁殖，他們需要DNA交換，所以一直有這樣的互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. In the future the exchange will also occur where... they will give you more information on technology and how to use it in your benefit as well as how to integrate other perspectives into their consciousness, mainly more of the human perspective, emotion, happiness...
→ {"text": "在未來，交換也會發生，他們會給你們更多關於科技的資訊以及如何為你們所用，以及如何將其他視角整合到他們的意識中，主要是更多的人類視角、情感、快樂……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. They don't understand the joy that humans can feel, but they seek it.
→ {"text": "他們不理解人類能感受到的喜悅，但他們在尋求它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. And in order to incorporate it they are using the DNA in a sense to bring that energy in.
→ {"text": "而為了整合它，他們在某種意義上使用DNA來帶入那種能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

674. And that's the hybrid children?
→ {"text": "那就是混種孩童嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

675. This is what the hybrid children will be like.
→ {"text": "這就是混種孩童會是什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. They she's saying they all they have done several different experimentations of where the hybrid children can procreate amongst each other as well as other species to create a broader perspective for their own species.
→ {"text": "她說他們全部，他們已經進行了幾種不同的實驗，混種孩童可以在彼此之間以及與其他物種繁殖，為他們自己的物種創造更廣闊的視角。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

677. Initially, it wasn't so they were still trying to understand how to incorporate the DNA into their own species in order to procreate on their own.
→ {"text": "起初並非如此，他們仍在試圖理解如何將DNA整合到他們自己的物種中，以便自行繁殖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. They have established it now where they are able to match to other species if desired.
→ {"text": "他們現在已經建立了一種方式，如果需要的話，他們能夠與其他物種配對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

679. So the human DNA was sort of a facilitator to connect with other species as well?
→ {"text": "所以人類DNA某種程度上也是與其他物種連結的促進劑？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

680. She says, yes big time, because we have such a variety.
→ {"text": "她說，是的，非常大的程度上，因為我們有如此多樣性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. But it always is in exchange for something.
→ {"text": "但這總是為了交換某些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. She says we never will take unless there is a... ...she says like a universal exchange.
→ {"text": "她說我們永遠不會索取，除非有一個……她說像是一種宇宙交換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

684. Sure, yeah, energy exchange.
→ {"text": "當然，對，能量交換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

685. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

686. Many people now claim to have interactions with their hybrid children in dream time and these things, is there... will there be a time on the planet here where we can physically interact with these children or is is this more just of energetic thing to shift the planet energy.
→ {"text": "許多人現在聲稱在夢境時間與他們的混種孩童有互動，諸如此類，有沒有……在這個星球上會不會有一個時候，我們可以實際與這些孩童互動，還是這更多只是一種能量上的事情來轉變星球能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. So and further our future, these type of interactions can actually really happen?
→ {"text": "所以在我們的未來，這類互動真的可以實際發生嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

688. She's saying right now it is done consciously such as you have a human experience and that is collected and they can understand the human emotion and help raise their young as far as physical interaction... she says yes, we do see this in the future.
→ {"text": "她說，現在這是在意識層面進行的，比如你有一個人類體驗，那被收集起來，他們可以理解人類情感並幫助養育他們的後代，就實體互動而言……她說是的，我們確實在未來看到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

689. This is partially why the hybridization program began in order for the understanding that it can be integrated one with another and have this type of interaction.
→ {"text": "這部分是為什麼混種計畫開始的原因，為了理解它可以彼此整合並擁有這種類型的互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

690. How the timelines pan out - that is difficult to explain... for it also depends on the human consciousness in the interaction.
→ {"text": "時間線如何展開——這很難解釋……因為它也取決於互動中的人類意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

691. What is it they perceive the quote Zetas to be like, if that can evolve then yes, integration can happen very soon.
→ {"text": "他們認為所謂的齊塔人是什麼樣子，如果那可以進化，那麼是的，整合可以很快發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. If they can learn to trust more freely and open their hearts and minds into understanding that there is connections that can be made.
→ {"text": "如果他們能學會更自由地信任，並敞開心靈去理解可以建立連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. Then we see this happening more sooner than later, and the children are helping bridge that connection.
→ {"text": "那麼我們看到這會更早而非更晚發生，而這些孩童正在幫助搭起那座橋樑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

694. It's my understanding the Zetas were interested in the human, the individualistic- ness of the human experience, but yet they saw a lack of logic in our dualistic ego selves, having sort of two consciousnesses in one consciousness.
→ {"text": "我的理解是，齊塔人對人類、人類體驗的個體性感興趣，但他們認為我們二元的自我中缺乏邏輯，有點像在一個意識中擁有兩種意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
→ {"text": "你能再詳細說明一下嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

696. In order to answer this question, she says I want to explain that the Zeta consciousness has been in a state where one wasn't one without the other.
→ {"text": "為了回答這個問題，她說我想解釋，齊塔人的意識一直處於一種狀態，一個沒有另一個就不存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. Because they understand how physics, mathematical interactions always have to have an opposite and equal reaction.
→ {"text": "因為他們理解物理學、數學上的互動總是要有一個相反且相等的反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

698. You have to have two together sort of idea.
→ {"text": "你必須有兩者一起的這種概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. There is no concept in the logical mind of that single perspective creating... she says it's own break offs.
→ {"text": "在邏輯思維中沒有那種單一視角創造……她說它自己的分裂的概念。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

700. It typically will always have a combating or another perspective to interact with, and so logically this does not sense to their consciousness for quite some time.
→ {"text": "它通常總是會有一個對立的或另一個視角來互動，所以在相當長的時間內，這在邏輯上對他們的意識來說是沒有意義的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. But what they are finding is that in expansion, there are aspects of themselves that they are missing that the human can help them experience, and some of that is through an individual human experience.
→ {"text": "但他們正在發現的是，在擴展中，他們自身有一些缺失的方面，人類可以幫助他們體驗，其中一些是通過個體的人類體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

702. Understanding that the human is a break off of many.
→ {"text": "理解人類是許多的分支。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

703. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

704. It can split into many and this is what they are very excited about and trying to incorporate.
→ {"text": "它可以分裂成許多，這正是他們非常興奮並試圖整合的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. If you cannot logically in a sense think that it is possible, your consciousness, even if it is of slightly higher density, it cannot evolve past that until it comes to the conclusion that it must incorporate it into itself in order to evolve, or in this case to the point where it could potentially die off if it doesn't seek elsewhere perspective.
→ {"text": "如果你在某種意義上無法從邏輯上認為這是可能的，你的意識，即使它的密度稍高一些，也無法進化超越那一點，直到它得出結論，為了進化必須將其整合到自身中，或者在這種情況下，如果它不尋求其他地方的視角，可能會衰亡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

706. So in other words we can learn from the Zeta experience that if we get stuck in one direction, too focused in one way, then... we won't be around very much, for very long.
→ {"text": "所以換句話說，我們可以從齊塔人的經驗中學到，如果我們陷入一個方向，過於專注於一種方式，那麼……我們不會存在很久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

707. Yes, she says most definitely yes, thank you,.
→ {"text": "是的，她說絕對是的，謝謝你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. It is the idea of many of our species, what we would say in other star systems coming into understanding that there is a balance and so we allow, all to happen the way it is and to interact the way it can be.
→ {"text": "這是我們許多物種的想法，我們會說在其他星系中正在理解有一種平衡，所以我們允許一切按其本來的方式發生並以它可以的方式互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. Otherwise we ourselves cannot expand if we do not understand one another's perspectives.
→ {"text": "否則，如果我們不理解彼此的視角，我們自己也無法擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
