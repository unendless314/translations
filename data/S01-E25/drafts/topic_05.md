## Speaker Group 113

333. So where are we going with all this?
→ {"text": "那麼，我們接下來要談什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. [CHUCKLES] What's next?
→ {"text": "【笑】下一步是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

335. So why is this so important?
→ {"text": "為什麼這點如此重要？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

336. Why is it so important that we have this galactic soup here on Earth?
→ {"text": "為什麼在地球上擁有這碗銀河混合湯如此重要？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

337. She says, well, for one case, for one thing that we really want to drive home, so to speak, in the human species consciousness is to understand there's no good and evil.
→ {"text": "她說，首先有一點我們真正想要讓人類物種的意識深刻理解的是：沒有絕對的善與惡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. The serpent species has been termed as the evil, the benevolent, the Pleiades, and they have been working together.
→ {"text": "蛇族被冠上「邪惡」的標籤，而昴宿星人被視為「善意的」，但他們其實一直在合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. She says, but what you have are individual consciousness, perhaps, or beings that individually selected to dominate in an unbeneficial way.
→ {"text": "她說，但實際情況是，有一些個體意識，或者說有些存有個別選擇以無益的方式進行支配。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

340. And they get blamed for--
→ {"text": "然後整個族群就因此被責怪——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

341. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. Basically to-- she says, we want to go back to the serpent species, because we have spoken that they are not all Reptilian.
→ {"text": "基本上——她說，我們想再回頭談談蛇族，因為我們已經提過他們並非全都是爬蟲形態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. The serpent species also has beings that have used the domination for evil purposes, quote unquote, she says, to take over consciousness.
→ {"text": "蛇族中也有些存有為了「邪惡目的」——她說引號——使用支配來接管意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. But they don't look like reptiles.
→ {"text": "但他們看起來並不像爬蟲類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. So basically, we've pinned the reptile as the bad, the benevolent blondes as the god good.
→ {"text": "所以基本上，我們把爬蟲類釘死為壞人，把善意的金髮存有當成好神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

346. Of course, because that's what we look like.
→ {"text": "當然，因為我們長得就像那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

347. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

348. [CHUCKLING] We're good, you're bad.
→ {"text": "【輕笑】我們是好的，你們是壞的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. Anything that looks different.
→ {"text": "任何長得不一樣的就是壞的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

350. But I almost feel like they were good, so to speak.
→ {"text": "但我幾乎覺得他們算是善意的，可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. They were trying to be creator gods.
→ {"text": "他們試圖成為創造神。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. And other species from the serpent species used that power to dominate the human consciousness, if that makes sense.
→ {"text": "而蛇族中的其他物種利用那種力量來支配人類意識，如果這說得通的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. Using an archetype is only going back so far.
→ {"text": "使用原型這個概念只能追溯到一定程度。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

354. It sounds like there's more to the story than just archetypes.
→ {"text": "聽起來這個故事不只是原型那麼簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

355. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. Consider once again the part of your question where you brought in the dinosaurs.
→ {"text": "再想想你問題中提到恐龍的那部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. They are survival, but their DNA is key in the planetary creation.
→ {"text": "他們代表生存，但他們的 DNA 在行星創造中是關鍵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And so when you consider this, you consider that the human is a large part of this, so to hate them would be to hate yourself.
→ {"text": "所以當你考慮到這點，你會意識到人類很大一部分就是這樣構成的，所以仇恨他們就是仇恨你自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

359. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

360. She's saying, also consider what we speak of the serpent species.
→ {"text": "她說，也請思考我們所說的蛇族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. And also, when you do your research, go back and find that there is serpent species, serpent race, these type of callings-- names.
→ {"text": "而且當你做研究時，回頭去找找看有蛇族、蛇族種族這類稱呼——這些名稱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. She says, see if you can't tap in and see the visuals, and see that not all are actually reptiles.
→ {"text": "她說，看看你能否連接上並看到那些視覺畫面，然後你會看到並非全都是爬蟲類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Some look, she says, more mammalian.
→ {"text": "她說，有些看起來更像哺乳類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. All kinds.
→ {"text": "各種形態都有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. All kinds, she says.
→ {"text": "她說，各種形態都有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Even some bird.
→ {"text": "甚至有些鳥類形態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

367. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

368. They represent the Reptilian agenda that you now reference in today's timeline, though.
→ {"text": "不過，他們確實代表了你們現在在當今時間線上所提到的爬蟲人計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. The conquering the human consciousness.
→ {"text": "征服人類意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. And so when you hear Reptilian, this is what you think of.
→ {"text": "所以當你聽到爬蟲人時，你想到的就是這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. When you hear serpent, you think, oh, the Reptilian domination.
→ {"text": "當你聽到蛇族時，你想，喔，就是爬蟲人的支配。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. But the serpent species is actually a broader idea.
→ {"text": "但蛇族實際上是一個更廣泛的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

373. Well, we do know, in our own evolution, how birds are linked to the Reptilian energy.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們確實知道，在我們自己的演化中，鳥類與爬蟲能量是如何連結的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. The Avians are quite close in the family.
→ {"text": "鳥族在這個家族中相當接近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. But my understanding is that the Pleiadians have a lot of that energy already as well-- the bird energy, or.
→ {"text": "但我理解昴宿星人也已經有很多那種能量——鳥族能量，或者說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

376. She says they do.
→ {"text": "她說他們確實有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. They do.
→ {"text": "他們確實有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. And remember, they work together.
→ {"text": "而且記住，他們是一起合作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. They understand one another.
→ {"text": "他們彼此理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. OK, so she's showing me some visuals of the Pleiades actually having large families.
→ {"text": "好，她正在顯示給我看一些昴宿星區域實際上有大家族的視覺畫面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. They sort of-- I'm getting spacey because-- OK, she's trying to get through to me.
→ {"text": "他們有點——我有點恍神因為——好，她正在試著傳達給我。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

382. Hold on.
→ {"text": "等一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

383. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

384. They were the first advocates of one male, several females, because they understood the lineage and the importance of carrying on down the bloodlines.
→ {"text": "他們是一夫多妻制的最初倡導者，因為他們理解血脈以及透過血統傳承延續的重要性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. This came from your Orion star system, but it has turned into something negative.
→ {"text": "這源自你們的獵戶座星系，但它已經轉變成負面的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. But that which you call God came from this sort of idea that lineage could be carried down through the bloodlines and to--
→ {"text": "但你們所稱的神就是來自這種血脈可以透過血統傳承下去並且——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

387. Can you back up and explain that what we call God?
→ {"text": "你能退回來解釋一下我們所稱的神是什麼意思嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. You mean the male figure of God?
→ {"text": "你是指男性形象的神？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

389. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

390. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. Basically, she says, like, Abrahamic covenant.
→ {"text": "基本上，她說，像是亞伯拉罕盟約那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

392. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. That idea of God, the image of God, she's saying that she just wants humanity to understand that there are beings of Orion that have a very male dominant type of energy that have brought that to Earth.
→ {"text": "關於神的這種想法、神的形象，她說她只是想讓人類理解，有些獵戶座存有擁有非常男性主導類型的能量，並將這種能量帶到了地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. The rulingship of the man, basically, and passing it down through the bloodlines into the males.
→ {"text": "基本上就是男性的統治權，並透過血統傳給男性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. She says, mainly, though, because also, a man can have several children with different wives and pass his seed along to ensure that his kingdom would be maintained accordingly.
→ {"text": "她說，主要是因為，一個男人可以和不同妻子生好幾個孩子，傳遞他的種子，以確保他的王國能夠相應地維持下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. And he can pass down his lineage and his ideas that way.
→ {"text": "這樣他就能傳承他的血脈和他的理念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. But that comes from not necessarily Reptilian.
→ {"text": "但這並不一定來自爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. She's saying, that's an Orion energy.
→ {"text": "她說，那是獵戶座能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. She says, not saying that we live like that here.
→ {"text": "她說，並不是說我們在這裡也那樣生活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. We're just saying that that was incorporated with that idea from us, from the Orion.
→ {"text": "我們只是說那個概念是從我們這裡、從獵戶座融入進去的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

401. It was part of our DNA.
→ {"text": "那是我們 DNA 的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

402. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

403. That we carry that energy.
→ {"text": "我們帶有那種能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. And I guess we're working through that.
→ {"text": "而我想我們正在克服那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. And it's not serving us anymore, so we're evolving past that now, or-- some of us.
→ {"text": "那已經不再對我們有益了，所以我們現在正在演化超越它，或者說——我們有些人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. [CHUCKLES]
→ {"text": "【輕笑】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

407. She says you're moving past the rulingship.
→ {"text": "她說你們正在超越統治權的階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. There is still the idea behind a man being able to have children from several other wives that can also be beneficial because we are still mammalian, in a large sense, and we are working toward building more of the community based on that idea.
→ {"text": "一個男人能夠與多位妻子生育孩子這個概念背後的想法仍然可能是有益的，因為我們在很大程度上仍然是哺乳動物，而且我們正在朝著基於這個理念建立更多社群的方向努力。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

409. She's saying, but it also all goes back to your original concerns and questions with the Reptilian and the rulingship now, that the rulers and the kings and the queens, that is a Reptilian idea.
→ {"text": "她說，但這也都回到了你最初對爬蟲人和統治權的關切和疑問，統治者、國王和女王，那是爬蟲人的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. She says it's not necessarily--
→ {"text": "她說這不一定——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

411. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. Yeah, I understand now what she's trying to convey, as far as, I had this concept of hierarchy and ruling being a Reptilian idea.
→ {"text": "對，我現在理解她想要傳達的了，就是說，我原本有這個概念，認為階級制度和統治是爬蟲人的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. And sounds like that's-- there's some aspects of that in the Reptilian lineage, but that's not a Reptilian, so to say-- that aspect particularly isn't just from the Reptilians.
→ {"text": "而聽起來——在爬蟲人的血統中確實有這方面的某些特質，但可以說那並非僅僅是爬蟲人的——那個特定面向並非只來自爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

414. But my understanding of that Reptilian archetype as a very male, masculine energy.
→ {"text": "但我對爬蟲人原型的理解是一種非常男性化的、陽剛的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. And then I've also understood that the Pleiadians has been more of a feminine, a softer energy.
→ {"text": "然後我也理解昴宿星人更偏向女性化、更柔和的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. And the merging of the two, the Annunaki, and then us, creating, adding extra spices in there, it seems.
→ {"text": "而這兩者的融合，阿努納奇，然後是我們，創造時又添加了額外的調味料，似乎是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

417. She says, that is true.
→ {"text": "她說，這是對的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. One thing to note, though, is that the male side in the Pleiade region is more like a mentor-- teacher.
→ {"text": "不過有一點要注意，昴宿星區域的男性面向更像是導師——老師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. And that can take on that feminine side, but also understands the male role.
→ {"text": "這可以展現女性化的一面，但也理解男性角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. The feminine side of the Reptilian, she says, is gaining wisdom and working that into knowledge with teaching the youth.
→ {"text": "她說，爬蟲人的女性面向是獲取智慧，並將其轉化為知識來教導年輕一代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. Those type of things.
→ {"text": "這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. Creating a better lifestyle for communities with technology, and that kind of business, she says.
→ {"text": "她說，用科技為社群創造更好的生活方式，諸如此類的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. So there is a little bit of both that is different.
→ {"text": "所以兩者都有一些不同的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. But we have interpreted the male energy is dominant, and maybe perhaps controlling, because that is what the humans have perceived it to be for so long.
→ {"text": "但我們將男性能量詮釋為主導的、也許可能是控制性的，因為這就是人類長久以來所感知到的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

425. It's what we experienced here.
→ {"text": "這是我們在這裡經歷到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. Or at least our history and what we remember so far.
→ {"text": "或至少是我們的歷史和我們目前所記得的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. So I'm assuming as we uncover our history, we can break free of some of these stereotypes of what a male is, what a female is.
→ {"text": "所以我想隨著我們揭露歷史，我們可以打破一些關於男性是什麼、女性是什麼的刻板印象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

428. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. She says, one more thing to add is the serpent species as we spoke of-- or Reptilians-- don't tend to hide the masculinity in that sense.
→ {"text": "她說，還有一點要補充的是，我們剛才談到的蛇族——或者說爬蟲人——在這方面往往不會隱藏陽剛性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. The Orion side, they understand that, and they allow it to occur.
→ {"text": "獵戶座那邊，他們理解那一點，而且他們允許它發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. But they also know how to-- she says mask it in a sense with their ability to teach.
→ {"text": "但他們也知道如何——她說在某種意義上用他們教導的能力來掩飾它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. But there still is a bit of a masculine side that they incorporate, or have incorporated into the human experience.
→ {"text": "但他們仍然融入了一些陽剛的面向，或者說已經融入到人類經驗中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
