## Speaker Group 7

34. Well, let's start with Atlantis.
→ {"text": "那麼，讓我們從亞特蘭提斯開始吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

35. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

36. And I hate to put a timeline on things, but I'm guessing around 25,000 years ago?
→ {"text": "我不喜歡為事物設定時間線，但我猜大約是 25，000 年前？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

37. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. OK, so the woman says further back than that, my love, but yes.
→ {"text": "好的，所以這位女士說，比那還要更久遠，我的愛，但是是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. A very special time period indeed.
→ {"text": "確實是一個非常特殊的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. What is it that you would like to know?
→ {"text": "你想知道什麼呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

41. Is that-- because I've heard from other channels and other guides that humanity carries a lot of trauma from the Atlantean periods.
→ {"text": "是這樣嗎——因為我從其他通靈者和其他指導靈那裡聽說，人類承載了許多來自亞特蘭提斯時期的創傷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. So I guess my question would be, is much of what we're dealing with on the planet now, is it tied into the Atlantean energy?
→ {"text": "所以我想問的是，我們現在在地球上所面對的許多問題，是否與亞特蘭提斯能量有關？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

43. She says, I'm not sure if I would call it traumas, though it does take some healing to transform what has been learned during this time period and where you are moving toward.
→ {"text": "她說，我不確定我會稱之為創傷，雖然確實需要一些療癒來轉化在這個時期所學到的，以及你們正在前進的方向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. She says, you see, during the Atlantean time period, consciousness had grown exponentially and experiments were taking place.
→ {"text": "她說，你要明白，在亞特蘭提斯時期，意識呈指數級成長，各種實驗正在進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. And yes, humanity as well as other species had to learn that this is not how expansion was to occur in the most beneficial way.
→ {"text": "是的，人類以及其他物種都必須學到，這不是擴展以最有益方式發生的途徑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. So those that understood this opted into a alternative experience-- an experience where they could learn in a slightly different way.
→ {"text": "所以那些理解這一點的存有選擇了另一種體驗——一種能讓他們以略微不同的方式學習的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. So you may call it traumatic in the sense that what once was known was erased or taken, but we would also like to call it a teaching or learning opportunity for the expansion of humanity that they opted into.
→ {"text": "所以你可以從某種意義上稱之為創傷性的，因為曾經已知的事物被抹除或奪走了，但我們也想稱之為一個教學或學習機會，是為了人類的擴展而他們所選擇的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

48. Was the Annunaki DNA injection, was that prior or after the Atlantean experience?
→ {"text": "阿努納奇的DNA注入，是在亞特蘭提斯經驗之前還是之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. In our linear sense of time.
→ {"text": "以我們線性的時間感來說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

50. She says, right prior to the diluvian time period with the Annunaki, but there seems to be a disconnect with what she's showing me.
→ {"text": "她說，就在阿努納奇的大洪水時期之前，但她顯示給我看的似乎有些斷層。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. I'm seeing if she can use verbals.
→ {"text": "我看她能否用言語表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Basically, there seemed to be an Atlantean time period further back from when the Annunaki actually came and created their hybrid human.
→ {"text": "基本上，在阿努納奇實際到來並創造他們的混種人類之前，似乎有一個更早的亞特蘭提斯時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. And then she's showing me that, with the diluvian waters, they erased all of this.
→ {"text": "然後她在顯示給我看，隨著大洪水，他們抹去了這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. But some Annunaki saved some of the humanoid to carry on that genetic map that they created.
→ {"text": "但一些阿努納奇拯救了一些類人生物，以延續他們所創造的基因圖譜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

55. When you say "diluvian," can you go into more detail about that?
→ {"text": "當你說「大洪水」，能否更詳細說明一下？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. What does that mean?
→ {"text": "那是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

57. She says the great flood that we have known to be called the great flood.
→ {"text": "她說就是我們所知的大洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. She says, this is a common misconception in understanding the human evolution, because there were humanoids in the Atlantean time period, but we would suggest that they were more 5th dimensional beings.
→ {"text": "她說，這是理解人類進化時的一個常見誤解，因為亞特蘭提斯時期確實有類人生物，但我們認為他們更像是第五維度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. They were not essentially what the human is today.
→ {"text": "他們本質上並不是今天的人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. That human is the creation of what the Annunaki created right prior to this diluvian time period.
→ {"text": "今天的人類是阿努納奇在大洪水時期之前所創造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

61. But the Annunaki borrowed some DNA from that time period, or from that energy?
→ {"text": "但阿努納奇有借用那個時期的一些DNA，或是那種能量嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Or is that just, I guess, the Atlantean karma that we're dealing with, is that just more energetic as opposed to DNA?
→ {"text": "還是說，我猜，我們所面對的亞特蘭提斯業力，只是能量層面的而非DNA層面的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

63. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. That's a good question.
→ {"text": "這是個好問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. She says, with reference to your question, I would say that this is more energetic.
→ {"text": "她說，關於你的問題，我會說這更多是能量層面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. It is a consciousness that was tampered with in order to bring in the consciousness of a humanoid.
→ {"text": "那是一種被干預過的意識，目的是為了引入類人生物的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. She says, once again, the Atlanteans were, she says, like a type of human species.
→ {"text": "她說，再次強調，亞特蘭提斯人是一種類似人類物種的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. But they-- she's saying they're not what you exactly think, and I'm asking her if she can be more specific with the details of how this all occurred.
→ {"text": "但他們——她說他們並不完全是你所想的那樣，而我正在問她能否更具體說明這一切是如何發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. She says, basically, it's a different type of humanoid.
→ {"text": "她說，基本上，那是一種不同類型的類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. It's a higher-evolved human conscience that was there.
→ {"text": "那是一種更高度演化的人類意識存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. It's different than what the Annunaki created.
→ {"text": "與阿努納奇所創造的不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

72. Is it a mixture of different beings?
→ {"text": "那是不同存有的混合體嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. Where there Pleiadians, and Mantoids, and--
→ {"text": "那裡有昴宿星人、昆蟲族，還有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

74. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

75. --Lyrans, and they were all just having a big party?
→ {"text": "——天琴座人，他們全都在舉行一場大派對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

76. She says yes, but there were also very select that had a specific type of DNA.
→ {"text": "她說是的，但也有非常精選的存有擁有特定類型的DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. But then things started to get mixed in an experimental way, she says, not in necessarily a mating way.
→ {"text": "但後來事情開始以實驗的方式混合，她說，不一定是以交配的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. The Annunaki efforts evolved into a mating energetic manipulation of the DNA.
→ {"text": "阿努納奇的努力演變成以交配能量來操控DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

79. So did the Annunaki come after the Atlantean destruction?
→ {"text": "所以阿努納奇是在亞特蘭提斯毀滅之後來的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. Was this great diluvian flood, was that a reaction to the Atlantean experimentation in technology and energy?
→ {"text": "這場大洪水，是對亞特蘭提斯在技術和能量方面的實驗的反應嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

81. She's saying we think the Atlantean happened before as far as linear time period compared to when the Annunaki came and actually manipulated the human DNA.
→ {"text": "她說，就線性時間而言，我們認為亞特蘭提斯發生在阿努納奇到來並實際操控人類DNA之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. And there seems to be a disconnect with the human in Atlantean time period versus the human that the Annunaki created.
→ {"text": "而亞特蘭提斯時期的人類與阿努納奇創造的人類之間似乎存在斷層。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. There's a little bit different--
→ {"text": "有一點不同——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

84. Energy?
→ {"text": "能量？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

85. --energy, and the dimensional frequency that that human is capable of being a part of.
→ {"text": "——能量，以及那種人類能夠參與的維度頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

86. What density was the Atlantean experience?
→ {"text": "亞特蘭提斯經驗是什麼密度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

87. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. She says it's the fifth dimension, fourth density.
→ {"text": "她說是第五維度，第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

89. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

90. She's saying, part of the confusion could be the shifting of the Earth, and the part of waters rising.
→ {"text": "她說，部分困惑可能來自地球的移動，以及水位上升的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. She's saying that the flood that we're speaking of, the deluge right after the Annunaki manipulated the human genome--
→ {"text": "她說，我們所說的洪水，就是阿努納奇操控人類基因組之後的大洪水——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

92. Oh, this is a second flood.
→ {"text": "哦，這是第二次洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

93. There seems to be different floodings.
→ {"text": "似乎有不同的洪水事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. The great deluge, she's saying, was intentional.
→ {"text": "她說，大洪水是刻意為之的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. The flood that took out Atlantis, she's saying, was a shifting of the planet.
→ {"text": "她說，摧毀亞特蘭提斯的洪水是地球移動造成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. And then there was another shifting later down the road, after the deluge, if that makes sense.
→ {"text": "然後在大洪水之後，後來又發生了另一次地球移動，如果這樣說得通的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

97. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

98. She's just basically apologizing for the timelines of trying to construct in our minds how it all played out.
→ {"text": "她基本上是在為時間線的複雜性致歉，因為我們的思維很難構建出這一切是如何發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. But she understands it with the evolution of how the Earth has cycled through.
→ {"text": "但她從地球如何經歷循環演化的角度理解這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. She's saying that there were other things that happened during the Atlantean time period that took the destruction.
→ {"text": "她說，在亞特蘭提斯時期還發生了其他導致毀滅的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. Chemical warfare, wars.
→ {"text": "化學戰、戰爭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. The waters could be manipulated, but they weren't used for this specific purpose as they were in the deluge that we speak of, the great flooding that was meant to wipe out and reset the human species.
→ {"text": "水可以被操控，但它們並未像我們所說的大洪水那樣被用於這個特定目的——那場旨在消滅並重置人類物種的大洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

103. She says, in a linear format, it would be Atlantean time period in a fifth-dimensional state with wars of chemicals, experimentation, and these sorts.
→ {"text": "她說，以線性方式來說，會是處於第五維度狀態的亞特蘭提斯時期，有化學戰、實驗等等這些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. And the Earth changed and shifted accordingly.
→ {"text": "然後地球相應地改變和移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. And the waters rose, and even the land shifted and changed.
→ {"text": "水位上升，甚至陸地也移動和改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. And then we could say that, for some time, Earth was desolate.
→ {"text": "然後我們可以說，地球有一段時間是荒蕪的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. And that's when the Annunaki came.
→ {"text": "就是那時阿努納奇來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. And they created the humanoid based on their needs.
→ {"text": "他們根據自己的需要創造了類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. And she says things began to spiral out of control, in a sense, where they were repeating the Atlantean time period with their experimentation, and understood that now they would have to deal with the energy accordingly, and created a flooding to reset the species.
→ {"text": "她說，從某種意義上說，事情開始失控，他們的實驗正在重複亞特蘭提斯時期的模式，他們明白現在必須相應地處理這股能量，於是製造了一場洪水來重置這個物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

110. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. So the Annunaki actually created the flood.
→ {"text": "所以阿努納奇實際上製造了洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

112. She says yes.
→ {"text": "她說是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

113. Was this coming from the higher-ups because they So were they ordered to do the flood?
→ {"text": "這是來自上層的命令嗎，因為他們——所以他們是被命令製造洪水的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

114. She says they didn't-- it was not an order.
→ {"text": "她說他們沒有——這不是命令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. They felt that a reset was necessary in order to undo the karmic energy that they had done.
→ {"text": "他們覺得有必要重置，以消除他們所造成的業力能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. She's bringing me back to Atlantis, which is telling me that they understood that the energy that was created in Atlantis with the experimentation led to-- I don't want, if you say bad karma, or a learning curve.
→ {"text": "她把我帶回亞特蘭提斯，這告訴我他們明白在亞特蘭提斯因實驗而創造的能量導致了——我不想說，如果你說是壞業力，或是學習曲線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. They didn't want to do that, so they decided, let's reset everything, and let's just make it right.
→ {"text": "他們不想那樣做，所以他們決定，讓我們重置一切，讓我們把事情做對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. And so they created this flooding area.
→ {"text": "於是他們製造了這場洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. OK, sorry.
→ {"text": "好的，抱歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. She's doing a lot more visuals than verbals.
→ {"text": "她顯示的視覺畫面比言語多得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. She's showing me, though, that many were actually sent away from where the flood was to preserve.
→ {"text": "不過她在顯示給我看，許多人實際上被送離洪水區域以保存下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. But they also felt like they were getting outnumbered, in a sense, and were trying to just select a few of the genomes that they wanted to preserve.
→ {"text": "但他們也感覺從某種意義上說他們的數量處於劣勢，試圖只選擇少數幾個他們想要保存的基因組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. She says it basically, in their minds, was a reset so they wouldn't have to do some of the energetic balance that Atlantis had to come face to face with.
→ {"text": "她說，基本上在他們心中，這是一次重置，這樣他們就不必面對亞特蘭提斯不得不正面面對的一些能量平衡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

124. But it still sounds like we're repeating ourselves over and over again.
→ {"text": "但這聽起來我們還是在一遍又一遍地重複。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

125. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. She says it's been very-- she says karmic.
→ {"text": "她說這非常——她說是業力的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. It's been very karmic.
→ {"text": "這非常具有業力性質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

128. It sounds almost like "Groundhog Day."
→ {"text": "這聽起來幾乎像《今天暫時停止》。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "電影Groundhog Day，台灣譯名《今天暫時停止》，指不斷重複同一天的情境"}


## Speaker Group 43

129. She says you cannot create a species and say, oh, no, what have I done?
→ {"text": "她說，你不能創造一個物種然後說，哦不，我做了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Let's reset.
→ {"text": "讓我們重置吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. She says, you cannot do this.
→ {"text": "她說，你不能這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. And so the creators-- the Annunaki that you call them-- have had to go through their own set of learning processes to redo the human species, and not in the way that they had previously planned in annihilating the genome.
→ {"text": "所以創造者們——你們稱之為阿努納奇——不得不經歷他們自己的一套學習過程來重新處理人類物種，而不是以他們先前計劃的消滅基因組的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. They must help them into higher consciousness.
→ {"text": "他們必須幫助人類進入更高的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

134. So they're our guides now.
→ {"text": "所以他們現在是我們的指導靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

135. She says, many have stepped forward to try to help.
→ {"text": "她說，許多存有已經挺身而出試圖幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

136. Mm-hm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. Does the Annunaki civilization that came initially to create this species, does that still exist in a fourth density, or in a physical form?
→ {"text": "最初來創造這個物種的阿努納奇文明，是否仍然存在於第四密度，或以物質形式存在？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. Fourth or fifth?
→ {"text": "第四還是第五？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

139. She says, not in the way that you would understand.
→ {"text": "她說，不是以你能理解的方式存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. It has surpassed.
→ {"text": "它已經超越了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. They have, she says, tried to help in many instances.
→ {"text": "她說，他們在許多情況下都試圖幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. And they have evolved to be more light beings, in a sense.
→ {"text": "從某種意義上說，他們已經演化成更接近光之存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. They have stood by humanity on a larger scale, and have tried to help.
→ {"text": "他們在更大的尺度上與人類同在，並試圖提供幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. And for this, they have evolved greatly.
→ {"text": "因為這樣，他們已經大大地演化了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. We would say that they are further in dimension than what you speak of.
→ {"text": "我們會說他們在維度上比你所說的更高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

146. Almost a collective?
→ {"text": "幾乎像是一個集體？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

147. She says yes, but they still desire to help humanity evolve because of the karmic cycle that had been created.
→ {"text": "她說是的，但他們仍然渴望幫助人類進化，因為已經創造的業力循環。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. Because their greatest desire is expansion as well.
→ {"text": "因為他們最大的渴望也是擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
