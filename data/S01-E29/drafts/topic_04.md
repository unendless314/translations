241. We spent many, many, many hours together on Skype being interviewed and so all of....

## Speaker Group 74

245. I had met Barbara, actually.
→ {"text": "事實上，我見過芭芭拉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. I had known Barbara off and on here, meeting her at the conference, but we weren't close.
→ {"text": "我斷斷續續認識芭芭拉，在研討會上遇過她，但我們並不親近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

247. Okay.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

248. And then she and I met at a separate meeting where Rob and I met too last April, and Barbara and I just connected and went off and just had our own little meeting for a little while.
→ {"text": "後來去年四月，我和她在一場聚會上相遇，那場聚會我也遇到了羅布。芭芭拉和我就這樣連結上了，我們跑到一邊去，單獨聊了一會兒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. And and then she invited me.
→ {"text": "然後她就邀請了我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. She said, Jacqueline I'd love to have you to be a part of this.

253. And it's been an incredible journey and we've all become very close.
→ {"text": "這是一段不可思議的旅程，我們所有人都變得非常親密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

## Speaker Group 82

257. This is a door that's been needed to be open for a while.
→ {"text": "這扇門早就應該打開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. And the gift is that it's open now, and that Barbara could be here, and open that door and that we could all be a part of it together.
→ {"text": "這份恩賜就是，現在門已經開了，芭芭拉能夠在這裡打開那扇門，而我們所有人都能一起參與其中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. It, it means more than I can even say.

## Speaker Group 83

260. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

261. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

262. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

263. Perfect.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. Have you come across, a lot of times in this world we see a lot of the positive and we mentioned the shift in the perspective and whatnot, but is there a negative force or negative entities out there that have, that you've encountered and come in contact with?
→ {"text": "你們有沒有遇過這種情況:在這個世界上，很多時候我們看到很多正面的，我們也提到了視角的轉變之類的，但有沒有所謂的負面力量或負面實體，是你們曾經遭遇過或接觸過的?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

265. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. There's the full spectrum of beings of what humans label positive and negative.
→ {"text": "存有有完整的頻譜，就是人類所標記的正面與負面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. When I talk to the star beings, they present it in this way.
→ {"text": "當我跟星際存有交談時，他們是這樣呈現的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. They say this just is.
→ {"text": "他們說，這就是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. We do not have the perspective of negative or positive, it's just the spectrum.
→ {"text": "我們不用負面或正面的角度看待，這只是一個頻譜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. So, but for us here, in terms of what we would label as, I kind of prefer to use the 'darker energy'.
→ {"text": "所以，對我們這裡來說，就我們所標記的而言，我比較喜歡用「較黑暗的能量」這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. That's just a part of it.
→ {"text": "那只是其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. I've had actually many encounters with those kinds of energies.
→ {"text": "事實上我遇過很多次這類能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. There are star beings or ETs who have the darker energy.
→ {"text": "有些星際存有或外星人帶有較黑暗的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. And I have had some encounters with them and it took me a while to understand and to learn how to work with that.
→ {"text": "我跟他們有過一些接觸，花了我一段時間才理解，才學會如何應對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. And once I understood it, it became easy.  For me it's all about sending them love and light.
→ {"text": "一旦我理解了，就變得容易了。對我來說，一切都關乎向他們傳送愛與光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. And when I send them love and light and I say to them, I choose to stand in the light and serve divine love and light, they're not interested in me at that point.  I'll say, you need to go find someone else.
→ {"text": "當我向他們傳送愛與光，並且對他們說，我選擇站在光中，服務於神聖之愛與光，他們在那一刻就對我失去興趣了。我會說，你們需要去找別人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. If you need to do that, but I am not going to choose to work with you.
→ {"text": "如果你們需要做那件事，但我不會選擇跟你們共事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. I have worked with a number of people where I will help clear them as a certified hypnotherapist, and I do healing work as well, to help the person come to a place of coming out of the fear. To help the person become empowered within themselves so that they can learn how to send the love and the light and stand in their power, and not be afraid because it's the fear that attracts them.
→ {"text": "我作為認證催眠治療師，曾幫助許多人進行清理，我也做療癒工作，協助他們走出恐懼。幫助他們在內在賦予自己力量，學會如何傳送愛與光，站在自己的力量中，不再恐懼，因為正是恐懼吸引了那些存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. So there... so there are those beings, ET beings who are of that nature and many other darker energies as well that we would not label ET, who are just of the darker forces doing what they're to do.
→ {"text": "所以有那些存有，外星存有帶有那種本質，還有許多其他較黑暗的能量，我們不會標記為外星人，他們只是屬於較黑暗的力量，在做他們該做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. If we shine the love and light, they're not interested in that.
→ {"text": "如果我們散發愛與光，他們就對此不感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. They're not resonating with that.
→ {"text": "他們不會與此共振。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. So they will go elsewhere.
→ {"text": "所以他們會去別處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. And I do like to, when I'm working with other people or I see them in the area or trying to intrude upon my space, I do call in Archangel Michael.
→ {"text": "當我在協助其他人工作時，或者我看到他們在這個區域，或試圖侵入我的空間時，我確實會召喚大天使米迦勒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. And my other star families who are very high love and light to escort them into, to connect with the original light.
→ {"text": "還有我其他帶有非常高的愛與光的星際家族，護送他們進入，連結到最初的光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. If that's appropriate, to take them where they need to go.
→ {"text": "如果那是恰當的，帶他們到他們需要去的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. And I always say I release all of you with love and light.
→ {"text": "我總是說，我以愛與光釋放你們所有人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. I honor respect, honor respect your role.
→ {"text": "我尊重，尊重你們的角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. And I release you with love and light.
→ {"text": "我以愛與光釋放你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. I don't go in... >>And you say if that's appropriate, meaning maybe in some cases it is, that's the experience that they need to experience.
→ {"text": "我不會介入... (主持人插話)你說「如果那是恰當的」，意思是說，也許在某些情況下，那就是他們需要經歷的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. Is that.. >>Correct
→ {"text": "是這樣嗎... (受訪者)沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

293. Is that fear and.. >>I leave that up to Archangel Michael.
→ {"text": "那是恐懼嗎，還是... (受訪者插話)我把那交給大天使米迦勒決定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. And the other angels who are working with escorting them into another space or dimension, that's not up to me to decide that's about their soul.
→ {"text": "還有其他天使在協助護送他們進入另一個空間或維度，那不是由我來決定的，那關乎他們的靈魂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. And those angels, but, and once you learn that it's really pretty easy then to shield, I call it shielding yourself with love.
→ {"text": "還有那些天使，但是，一旦你學會了，要建立防護就真的很容易了，我稱之為用愛防護自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. And my Qua Bar, my star being family, that's what he always says, they always say, cuz it's a group consciousness, they always say to all the star seeds, your shield is love and light and...
→ {"text": "我的夸巴，我的星際存有家族，他總是這樣說，他們總是這樣說，因為那是群體意識，他們總是對所有星際種子說，你們的防護就是愛與光，還有......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

297. So you're not necessarily putting up a wall or a shield per se, you're just vibrating at this love frequency, which creates an automatic sort of cloaking device.
→ {"text": "所以你不一定是真的豎起一道牆或防護罩，你只是以這個愛的頻率振動，這會自動產生某種隱形裝置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

298. It does put out love and light, and for me it does create a kind of shield.
→ {"text": "它確實散發出愛與光，對我來說它確實創造了某種防護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. And I do put love and light around me as a shield, if you..
→ {"text": "我確實會把愛與光放在我周圍作為防護，如果你......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. I mean everything.
→ {"text": "我是指一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. That's just for me that I like to love is, love and light is allowed to come in and out.
→ {"text": "那只是對我而言，我喜歡的是，愛與光可以自由進出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. But anything else is filtered because of I'm doing this work every day of my life, pretty much with people and I, it just gets filtered out.
→ {"text": "但其他東西會被過濾掉，因為我人生中幾乎每天都在做這個工作，跟人們一起工作，所以就會被過濾掉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

304. I guess when you say love and light shield, I guess the idea of putting up a wall or a barrier.. >>Right.
→ {"text": "我想當你說愛與光的防護時，我想豎起牆或障礙這個概念...... (受訪者插話)沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

305. actually attracts, but then if you're putting up a wall of love and light then it's not, the frequency....
→ {"text": "其實會吸引，但如果你豎起的是愛與光的牆，那就不會，頻率......", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. Usually when we put up the walls, it's a hate or a distaste, a not liking of... >>It's out of fear.
→ {"text": "通常我們豎起牆時，是出於仇恨或厭惡，不喜歡...... (受訪者插話)是出於恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

307. It's out of fear.
→ {"text": "是出於恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. And then that wall is created of fear and then it attracts more fear.
→ {"text": "然後那道牆就是用恐懼創造的，然後它就吸引更多恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

309. Correct.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. And I don't create, it's not a wall.
→ {"text": "我沒有創造，它不是一道牆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. Maybe I shouldn't even call it a shield.
→ {"text": "也許我甚至不該稱它為防護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. I perceive it in that way.
→ {"text": "我只是這樣理解它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. But it's just, I have certain boundaries.
→ {"text": "但就是，我有某些界限。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. I keep my psychic, I wanna keep my psychic boundaries, because of the work I'm doing. >> I learnt my lessons the hard way with that.
→ {"text": "我保持我的靈性界限，我想保持我的靈性界限，因為我在做這個工作。(另一位受訪者插話)我可是用艱難的方式學到這個教訓的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

315. And that's how I learned too, cuz I didn't have anybody to teach me.
→ {"text": "我也是這樣學會的，因為我沒有任何人可以教我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. And I learned some of it the hard way.
→ {"text": "有些我是用艱難的方式學會的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Definitely hard.
→ {"text": "絕對很艱難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. I feel like, enough of this!
→ {"text": "我就覺得，夠了!", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

321. For me, on the negative spectrum of things, I went to, when I first started waking up, I went full, I, what I like to call full blown light warrior mode.
→ {"text": "對我來說，在負面頻譜這方面，當我剛開始覺醒時，我進入了，我，我喜歡稱之為全面的光戰士模式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. I felt like I had to physically combat these negative entities.
→ {"text": "我覺得我必須在物質層面對抗這些負面實體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And I'll tell you in these physical forms, having a fist fight with a interdimensional being.. >>Wow.
→ {"text": "我告訴你，在這些物質形體中，跟一個跨維度存有打拳擊...... (主持人驚嘆)哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. And the more and more I just kept getting beat and kept getting beat.

→ {"text": "我必須學會寬恕自己，然後我注意到，當我停止戰鬥，我更深入到這裡，進入我的心，我變得更接納一切，接納所有事物，當負面實體出現時，我就是，我甚至不想理你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
