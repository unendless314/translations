## Speaker Group 256

642. Oh my goodness.
→ {"text": "我的天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

643. But one thing the ETs have taught me or talked to me about too is even well from the human perspective that we can go beyond what many people refer to as the karmic wheel or that going round and round.

649. So I just wanted to...
→ {"text": "所以我只是想…", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

650. And speaking of that, it seems the message I've been getting with all these interviews is we're at this place and time in our evolution as the humanities has been doing this cycle for 25,000 years or more.
→ {"text": "說到這個，我從所有這些訪談中得到的訊息似乎是，我們正處於進化的這個時空點上，而人類已經經歷這個週期兩萬五千年甚至更久了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

651. Or more, yeah, definitely.
→ {"text": "或更久，對，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
