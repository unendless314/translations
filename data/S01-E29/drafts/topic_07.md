656. The ascension event, that comes up the whole ascension event, right that I'm sure you've heard of?
→ {"text": "揚升事件，整個揚升事件的話題，你應該聽說過吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. And what is the ascension event?
→ {"text": "那什麼是揚升事件呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. And it's funny that you say 25,000 years ago, cuz what is at the, how far is the distance between the sun and the center of the milky way galaxy is approximately 25 - 26,000 years.
→ {"text": "有趣的是你提到 25，000 年前，因為太陽與銀河系中心之間的距離，用光年來算大約就是 25，000 到 26，000 光年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

659. Oh, interesting.
→ {"text": "喔，真有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

660. Okay.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

661. So on a physical level, from my understanding imagine this to our astronomers are just now discovering, you're seeing the light from this event that happened.
→ {"text": "所以從物質層面來說，根據我的理解，你可以這樣想——我們的天文學家現在正在發現的，是看到這個事件發出的光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. So about 25 to 26,000 years ago, a gas cloud came in and fell into the center of our black hole at the the super massive black hole, the center of the galaxy.
→ {"text": "所以大約在 25，000 到 26，000 年前，一團氣體雲飄進來，落入了我們銀河系中心的超大質量黑洞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. And we really don't have any kind of as a species, our scientists can't really comprehend what the super massive black hole is at the center.
→ {"text": "而作為一個物種，我們的科學家其實無法真正理解銀河系中心的超大質量黑洞究竟是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. When we need to fall, when the gas cloud falls into the center it's instantly converting all that mass and matter into energy, right?
→ {"text": "當氣體雲落入黑洞中心時，所有的質量與物質會瞬間轉換成能量，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. And it pulses, it brings, pushes out this energetic pulse, right?
→ {"text": "然後它會脈動，會釋放、推送出這股能量脈衝，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. We see in other galaxies and our own galaxy before, remnants of previous times where black hole woken up and there's, there'd be a energetic beam that shoots up 50,000 light years.
→ {"text": "我們在其他星系，還有我們自己的銀河系過去的歷史中，都能看到黑洞甦醒的痕跡——會有一道能量束射出 50，000 光年遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. One going up, one going down.
→ {"text": "一道向上射出，一道向下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. And so if you can imagine, that's a lot of energy.
→ {"text": "所以你可以想像，那是多麼巨大的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. So what happens is this energetic wave comes out from the center of the galaxy, and it's traveling near the speed of light.
→ {"text": "所以發生的情況是，這股能量波從銀河系中心釋放出來，以接近光速的速度傳播。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. The light itself takes 25 - 26,000 years for astronomers, they're saying, okay there's gas clouds going in, what happens next?
→ {"text": "光本身需要 25，000 到 26，000 年才能到達，所以天文學家會說：好，氣體雲正在掉進去，接下來會發生什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. Right behind the light, here comes the energy of it.
→ {"text": "緊跟在光之後，能量也跟著來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. Just this wave.
→ {"text": "就是這道波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. Coming outwards.
→ {"text": "向外擴散而來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. And it changes everything.
→ {"text": "它會改變一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. It changes everything.
→ {"text": "它會改變一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. Now that's, from what I understand, that's part of one of the reasons why the ET started coming back.
→ {"text": "這就是，根據我的理解，這是外星存有開始回來的原因之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

677. Cuz it's okay the negativity's getting outta hand here on Earth, and here comes this wave.
→ {"text": "因為好吧，地球上的負面性已經失控了，而這道波正在到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. What happens when this, it's a frequency, what happens when this frequency gets to Earth and Earth is going woooooo, and here comes this wuuuuu, you know what's gonna happen?
→ {"text": "當這個——它是一種頻率——當這個頻率到達地球，而地球正在「嗚嗚嗚」，然後這道「嗚嗚嗚」到來，你知道會發生什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

679. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "喔，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

680. Clash.
→ {"text": "衝撞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

681. Chaos. >>Yeah, chaos.
→ {"text": "混亂。沒錯，混亂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. Okay. I see.
→ {"text": "好的，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. Interesting.
→ {"text": "真有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

684. So if you look at things.. >>A storm?
→ {"text": "所以如果你這樣看事情的話…… 一場風暴？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

685. A storm, exactly.
→ {"text": "一場風暴，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

686. So when this wave gets here, they want to help try to raise the vibration to get the planet, the frequency specific.
→ {"text": "所以當這道波到達時，他們想要幫助提升振動頻率，讓地球達到特定的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. So this galactic wave doesn't hurt Earth, hurt us.
→ {"text": "這樣銀河波就不會傷害地球，不會傷害我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

688. It just evolved...
→ {"text": "只是進化……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

689. The hot and cold pressures.
→ {"text": "冷熱氣壓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

690. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

691. Don't collide as hard.
→ {"text": "不會那麼猛烈地碰撞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. So you don't get a hurricane, you get just a few raindrops.
→ {"text": "所以你不會遇到颶風，只會遇到幾滴雨而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

693. They took me that ship that that I witnessed, they took me up once and..
→ {"text": "他們曾經帶我上過那艘飛船，就是我目擊的那艘，他們帶我上去過一次，然後……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

694. The triangle ship?
→ {"text": "三角飛船？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

695. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

696. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. With these beings that you don't even know who they were.
→ {"text": "跟那些你甚至不知道是誰的存有一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

698. Yeah but the mantis be the mantis, there was a mantis and zeta aboard that craft, they use each other's ships.
→ {"text": "對，但螳螂族……螳螂族，那艘飛船上有螳螂族和齊塔，他們會共用彼此的飛船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

699. Okay. >>The experience was, ya know, these beings, I wake up in the middle of the night, and walk down the hallway and there's like a French door.
→ {"text": "好的。那次經驗是，你知道的，這些存有，我半夜醒來，走到走廊，那裡有扇法式門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. It goes in the back and there's a tall white zeta, if you will, standing there.
→ {"text": "門通向後面，有一個高大的白色齊塔，可以這麼說吧，站在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. And he says, hey let me in.
→ {"text": "他說：嘿，讓我進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

702. I said, oh, I ain't gonna let you in, man.
→ {"text": "我說：喔，我才不會讓你進來呢，老兄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

703. There's no way.
→ {"text": "門都沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

704. So it says, okay, we're gonna do this every night until you let me in.
→ {"text": "所以他說：好吧，我們每天晚上都會來做這件事，直到你讓我進去為止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. And so I pass out, wake up next night, same thing.
→ {"text": "然後我就昏過去了，隔天晚上醒來，又是一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

706. Let me in.
→ {"text": "讓我進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

707. Alright, I'll let you in.
→ {"text": "好吧，我讓你進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. I crack the door open, it sticks it's hand through, and I slam the door on his hand.
→ {"text": "我把門打開一條縫，他把手伸進來，然後我用門夾他的手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. It's fighting, and pulls away.
→ {"text": "他在掙扎，然後把手抽回去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. It's rubbing its hand.
→ {"text": "他在揉他的手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

711. It sits down.
→ {"text": "他坐下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

712. I sit down, we stare at each other, and he is it's okay, man, but we're gonna sit here and do this until you let me in.
→ {"text": "我也坐下來，我們互相瞪著對方，然後他說：好吧，老兄，但我們會一直坐在這裡做這件事，直到你讓我進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

713. And finally the third night, I let him in and, all right, here, let's do this.
→ {"text": "最後到了第三個晚上，我讓他進來了，好吧，來吧，我們做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

714. And he's like, all right, follow me.
→ {"text": "然後他說：好，跟我來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

715. I go up with him, and there's that.
→ {"text": "我跟著他上去，然後就看到那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

716. Triangle craft floating above me and it pulls me up into it.
→ {"text": "三角飛船漂浮在我上方，把我拉了進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

717. And next thing I know, he's standing in front of the view screen.
→ {"text": "接著我發現，他站在觀景螢幕前面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

718. It's like view screen.
→ {"text": "就像是觀景螢幕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

719. And he's - come here.

723. Okay?
→ {"text": "好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

724. So I walk up and we're over the valley, where I live, where I lived, the Salinas Valley and there's a, there's like Northern Lights, right?
→ {"text": "所以我走上前，我們在山谷上空，我住的地方，我當時住的沙利納斯山谷，然後有，有像極光一樣的東西，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

725. But red and orange, just like translucent energy, but it wasn't in the sky and it was on the ground.
→ {"text": "但是紅色和橙色的，就像半透明的能量，但它不在天空中，而是在地面上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

726. And I remember going, oh yeah, I'm just seeing the world end because I was listening to the, I think his name, oh, one of the remote viewers that talk about this kill shot of the sun.
→ {"text": "然後我記得我想：喔對，我看到世界末日了，因為我當時在聽，我想他的名字是，喔，某個遙視者談論太陽的致命一擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

733. That's not what this, what they showed me.
→ {"text": "不是那樣，不是他們給我看的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

734. It's this energetic wave that comes from the central black hole.
→ {"text": "是從中央黑洞來的這股能量波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

735. And it's more of a hug from the creator.
→ {"text": "而這更像是來自造物主的擁抱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

736. Yeah. >>The best way I can put it.
→ {"text": "對。這是我能想到的最好的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

737. Hopefully it snaps the minds of humanity up to be like, there's more to this universe than just these walls,
→ {"text": "希望它能讓人類的心智猛然覺醒，意識到這個宇宙不只是這些牆壁，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

738. And just humans.
→ {"text": "不只是人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

739. and the couch, there's more to it.
→ {"text": "和沙發，還有更多東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

740. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

741. And, but it goes, it even goes further than that too.
→ {"text": "而且，但這還不止於此，它還更深遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

742. How would I describe this?
→ {"text": "我該怎麼形容這個呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

743. Imagine yourself as you are now, right?
→ {"text": "想像一下現在的你，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

744. And you look forward, you look backwards, right?
→ {"text": "然後你往前看，往後看，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

745. If, imagine all these different strings, they come from your center, there's all these different strings that kind of go off in infinite amount of directions, right?
→ {"text": "想像所有這些不同的線，它們從你的中心出發，有所有這些不同的線向無限多個方向延伸出去，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

746. That is what that is, is represents at this point, there's an infinite amount of possibilities for me to do, right?
→ {"text": "這就是它所代表的意義，在這個點上，有無限多的可能性供我去做，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

747. An infinite amount of possibilities. Behind me is the same.
→ {"text": "無限多的可能性。我身後也是一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

748. There's an infinite amount of possibilities that got me here, right?
→ {"text": "有無限多的可能性讓我來到這裡，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

749. So an infinite amount of possibilities that got me here and an infinite amount of possibilities for where I'm gonna go.
→ {"text": "所以有無限多的可能性讓我來到這裡，也有無限多的可能性決定我要去哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

750. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

751. We experience these possibilities simultaneously.
→ {"text": "我們同時經驗著這些可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

752. The thing that my little spark is, is kinda like a little zipper that pulls all these experiences together.
→ {"text": "我的這個小火花，就像是一個小拉鍊，把所有這些經驗拉在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

753. The singularity if you will, pulls all these experiences together and then now my spark gets to choose which way I'm gonna go.
→ {"text": "可以說是奇點，把所有這些經驗拉在一起，然後現在我的火花可以選擇我要走哪條路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

754. Yeah. >>Of course it's hard for me to jump from, cuz this spark is experiencing this spectrum.
→ {"text": "對。當然我很難從這裡跳走，因為這個火花正在經驗這個光譜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

755. I can't just jump to this spectrum, I have to navigate through the bars.
→ {"text": "我不能直接跳到那個光譜，我必須穿過這些柵欄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

756. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

757. Okay, so but we split, we're constantly splitting.
→ {"text": "好的，所以我們在分裂，我們不斷在分裂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

758. And we're experiencing every possibility.
→ {"text": "而且我們正在經驗每一種可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

759. Now what happens when this happens over countless numbers of thousands of years.
→ {"text": "現在，當這種情況發生在無數個數千年之間，會發生什麼事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

760. Now if we go back to, everything's a fractal of itself.
→ {"text": "現在如果我們回到，一切都是自身的碎形。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

761. What happens in our universe as far as we know, when something gets too big for its britches, let's take a star for an example.
→ {"text": "在我們的宇宙中，就我們所知，當某個東西變得過於龐大，讓我們以恆星為例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

762. When a star gets too big, it collapses in on itself, right?
→ {"text": "當恆星變得太大時，它會向內坍縮，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

763. Becomes a supernova black hole, a white dwarf, whatever.
→ {"text": "變成超新星、黑洞、白矮星，不管是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

764. But it's becoming a new,it's becoming a new divine expression of creation.
→ {"text": "但它正在成為一個新的，它正在成為創造的新神聖表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

765. It wants to experience, oh, I'm too big.
→ {"text": "它想要體驗，喔，我太大了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

766. Let's experience something new.
→ {"text": "讓我們體驗一些新的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

767. So we have all these lines that go out and we've got, we've exhausted it.
→ {"text": "所以我們有所有這些向外延伸的線，而我們已經，我們已經耗盡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

768. On this planet, we've exhausted all the possibilities.
→ {"text": "在這個星球上，我們已經耗盡了所有的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

769. So now it's gotten too big.
→ {"text": "所以現在它變得太大了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

770. So it's like now our possibilities are collapsing in on themselves.
→ {"text": "所以現在就像我們的可能性正在向內坍縮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

771. It's just one big... >> The timelines. >>compression.
→ {"text": "就是一個大…… 時間線。壓縮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

772. Yeah, the timelines and everything.
→ {"text": "對，時間線和一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

773. It's a compression.
→ {"text": "這是一種壓縮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

774. So we're experiencing all these possible realities simultaneously.
→ {"text": "所以我們同時在經驗所有這些可能的實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

775. And now they're...
→ {"text": "而現在它們……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

776. Within the limitations of the third density.
→ {"text": "在第三密度的限制之內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

777. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

778. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

779. And now they're collapsing in on themselves and we become a new expression of divine creation.
→ {"text": "而現在它們正在向內坍縮，我們成為神聖創造的新表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

780. Fourth density consciousness.
→ {"text": "第四密度意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

781. And how do you want to experience that event is up to how you want to experience it.
→ {"text": "而你想要如何體驗那個事件，取決於你想要如何體驗它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

782. Gotcha.
→ {"text": "懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

783. If it's gonna be a world ending event, then that's how you're gonna experience your collapse.
→ {"text": "如果它會是一個世界末日事件，那麼這就是你體驗自己坍縮的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

784. You hear about the collapse of the economy, the collapse of society.
→ {"text": "你會聽到經濟的崩潰、社會的崩潰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

785. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

786. Collapse, collapse, collapse.
→ {"text": "崩潰、崩潰、崩潰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

787. So it's a collapse of possible possibility...
→ {"text": "所以這是可能性的坍縮……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

788. Of that those old paradigm ways of doing things.
→ {"text": "那些舊範式做事方式的坍縮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

789. Because we've exhausted the, we cannot continue to do things in that way.
→ {"text": "因為我們已經耗盡了，我們無法繼續以那種方式做事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

790. And somehow the trigger is this energetic wave from the black hole that's coming in now.
→ {"text": "而不知怎麼的，觸發點就是現在正在到來的這股來自黑洞的能量波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

791. That's what triggers the collapse.
→ {"text": "那就是觸發坍縮的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

792. It aligns right with all the other teachings and sayings, the harmonic convergence of '87.
→ {"text": "這與所有其他教導和說法完全一致，1987 年的和諧匯聚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

793. And yeah, there are so many potential people will ask me what's absolutely going to happen?
→ {"text": "而對，有很多人會問我：絕對會發生什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

794. There are so many possibilities.
→ {"text": "有太多的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

795. I'm just saying this a little different way, but kinda the same, of timelines, there are all those choices that, or potentials, that can happen depending on what humanity chooses.
→ {"text": "我只是用稍微不同的方式說這件事，但其實差不多，關於時間線，有所有那些選擇，或者說潛能，可能發生的事取決於人類選擇什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

796. Also collectively.
→ {"text": "也是集體的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

797. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

798. And but each soul gets to choose their journey, journey as well.
→ {"text": "而且每個靈魂也都能選擇自己的旅程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

799. For me, a very key message of what we term ascension is basically about humanity remembering that they are one with everything.
→ {"text": "對我來說，我們所說的揚升，其關鍵訊息基本上就是人類記起他們與萬物合一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

800. We are all one.
→ {"text": "我們都是一體的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

801. That we are cosmic citizens.
→ {"text": "我們是宇宙公民。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

802. And that expansion in consciousness and that on Earth that, that we need to come together in cooperation.
→ {"text": "而那意識的擴展，以及在地球上，我們需要在合作中團結起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

803. And to live from our hearts.
