538. Well, getting back to your guys' interactions.
→ {"text": "那麼，回到你們跟他們的互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. Do you have actual memories of being on the ships that you might be able to share and what those experiences-- and what entailed-- what's going on, or what happened.
→ {"text": "你們有實際記得在飛船上的經歷嗎?能分享一下那些體驗嗎——發生了什麼事，或是當時的狀況?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

540. Oh my.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

541. If you want to.
→ {"text": "如果你們願意的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

542. I do, but I'm trying to think of which one would be-- I'll give you two, two experiences that I would say are my most profound experiences ever.
→ {"text": "我願意，但我在想該分享哪一個——我會跟你們說兩個，兩個我認為是我這輩子最深刻的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. And I drew pictures of it.
→ {"text": "而且我畫了圖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. To recreate my experience, I'll let you check them out.
→ {"text": "為了重現我的體驗，我讓你們看一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

545. Oh, please.
→ {"text": "哦，請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

546. The one-- one of my most memorable was when I have an experience, I call it-- I come into consciousness or become aware of that I'm having the experience, 'cause you go to bed, and next thing you know, you're having an experience.
→ {"text": "其中一個——我最難忘的經歷之一，是當我有體驗時，我稱之為——我進入意識狀態，或意識到我正在經歷那個體驗，因為你就是上床睡覺，然後突然之間，你就在經歷某件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. So all of a sudden--
→ {"text": "所以突然之間——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

548. Like a lucid dream.
→ {"text": "就像清醒夢一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

549. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. But it's not-- it's not a dream.
→ {"text": "但它不是——它不是夢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. I can tell the difference between a dream and an experience because there's touch.
→ {"text": "我能分辨夢境和真實體驗的差別，因為有觸覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. There's texture.
→ {"text": "有質地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. There's smell.
→ {"text": "有氣味。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

554. There's taste, you know.
→ {"text": "有味道，你懂的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. It's just like-- you know, in dreams, you don't get-- we don't get this, you know?
→ {"text": "就像——你知道嗎，在夢裡，你不會有——我們不會有這些感覺，你懂吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. So I'm able to tell the difference between an actual experience and a dream.
→ {"text": "所以我能分辨真實體驗和夢境的差別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

557. And in this particular one, I came into awareness.
→ {"text": "在這次特別的體驗中，我進入了覺知狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. And I remember-- how do I start this?
→ {"text": "我記得——我該怎麼說起呢?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

559. Because it's so multidimensional.
→ {"text": "因為它非常多維度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. I remember being able to see 360 degrees around me.
→ {"text": "我記得我能看到周圍 360 度的景象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. I was smaller.
→ {"text": "我變小了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

562. I was probably about the size of a tennis ball.
→ {"text": "我大概只有網球那麼大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. And I was inside-- I remember seeing-- here's my perspective.
→ {"text": "而我在裡面——我記得看到——這是我的視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. I'm seeing hands like this and a being's face staring at me.
→ {"text": "我看到像這樣的手，還有一個存有的臉盯著我看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. And then I look around.
→ {"text": "然後我環顧四周。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. I can see around the being.
→ {"text": "我能看到那個存有周圍的景象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

567. And my body is in a chair like this, slumped over.
→ {"text": "我的身體就這樣癱坐在椅子上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. The top of my head was removed.
→ {"text": "我的頭頂被移開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. And you could see my brain with all the veins, and all the layers of-- the film layers.
→ {"text": "你可以看到我的大腦，有所有的血管，還有所有的層次——那些薄膜層。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. And there's three beings there rubbing their hands through my brain.
→ {"text": "有三個存有在那裡，把手伸進我的大腦裡撥弄著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. And so what I realized was what I was, they pulled my consciousness out of my body, and was holding my consciousness in my hand, which we all are just this little spark of divine creation.
→ {"text": "所以我意識到的是，我到底是什麼——他們把我的意識從身體裡抽出來，握在手中，而我們每個人其實都只是神聖創造的一點小火花。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

572. This is the 21 grams.
→ {"text": "這就是那 21 公克。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指靈魂的重量,傳說中靈魂離開身體時減少的 21 公克"}


## Speaker Group 171

573. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. That's exactly it.
→ {"text": "就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. And there's no-- when you're in that state of consciousness, when you're pulled out from your body, there's no fear.
→ {"text": "而且沒有——當你處於那種意識狀態時，當你被從身體裡拉出來時，沒有恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. There's just curiosity.
→ {"text": "只有好奇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. I remember thinking, wait.
→ {"text": "我記得我在想，等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. Where am I?
→ {"text": "我在哪裡?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. Wait.
→ {"text": "等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. Is that me?
→ {"text": "那是我嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. Yeah, that's me.
→ {"text": "對，那是我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. And then the being goes-- the being realized that I became aware.
→ {"text": "然後那個存有——那個存有意識到我醒來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. And it goes, oh, oh, oh, hey there.
→ {"text": "然後他說，哦、哦、哦，嘿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. Hey, why is a giraffe's neck so long?
→ {"text": "嘿，為什麼長頸鹿的脖子那麼長?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. And I said, I don't know.
→ {"text": "我說，我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. Why is a giraffe's neck so long?
→ {"text": "為什麼長頸鹿的脖子那麼長?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. And it says, because of its vertebrae.
→ {"text": "他說，因為牠的脊椎骨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "這是個冷笑話,因為答案等於沒說(脖子長當然是因為脊椎骨長)"}

588. [IMITATES LAUGH] And I remember just cracking up, right?
→ {"text": "【模仿笑聲】我記得我笑翻了，對吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. And I mean, I remember thinking, I can't believe that this being just made an attempt at this joke.
→ {"text": "我是說，我記得當時在想，我不敢相信這個存有居然試圖講這個笑話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. That's a terrible joke, but it's hilarious.
→ {"text": "這笑話糟透了，但超好笑的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. And my body-- I'm looking around, and my body goes... [SLOW LAUGH]
→ {"text": "而我的身體——我環顧四周，我的身體就……【緩慢笑聲】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

592. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. That's got to be so crazy.
→ {"text": "那一定超瘋狂的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

594. Human joke.
→ {"text": "人類笑話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

595. Tell me about it, right?
→ {"text": "可不是嗎，對吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. [LAUGHTER] You know, it just melted my brain.
→ {"text": "【笑聲】你知道嗎，這真的把我的腦袋融化了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. And this is before-- this is when my experiences were starting, so at that time, I wasn't quite really-- I was just, like, coming in, like-- so when I woke up the next-- all of a sudden, black.
→ {"text": "而這是在——這是我的體驗剛開始的時候，所以當時我還不太——我就像是，剛進入狀況，像是——所以當我隔天醒來時——突然之間，一片黑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

598. And I woke up, feel like I hit by a train.
→ {"text": "然後我醒來，感覺像被火車撞到一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. There's no marks on my head.
→ {"text": "我頭上沒有任何痕跡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

600. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. And did you ever get what they were doing to your brain?
→ {"text": "那你後來知道他們對你的大腦做了什麼嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

602. A little later, yeah.
→ {"text": "稍後知道了，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. But at that time, I had no idea.
→ {"text": "但當時我完全不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. It freaked me out.
→ {"text": "把我嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. And I was like, waking up back in my body, back in my self, going what the was that?
→ {"text": "我就像是，醒來回到我的身體裡，回到我自己，心想那到底是什麼鬼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. That's like saying, what the was that?
→ {"text": "就像在說，那到底是什麼鬼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. You know, it scared the crap out of me because I was getting sick at that time.
→ {"text": "你知道嗎，這把我嚇死了，因為我當時正在生病。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. At the beginning of my experience, I was 210 pounds.
→ {"text": "在我的體驗開始時，我有 210 磅重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

609. Went to 120 pounds.
→ {"text": "掉到 120 磅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. And the doctor said I was dying.
→ {"text": "醫生說我快死了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. And they didn't know why.
→ {"text": "他們不知道為什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

612. So at that time, I was thinking, oh god, what are they doing to me?
→ {"text": "所以當時我在想，天啊，他們對我做了什麼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

613. They're killing me.
→ {"text": "他們在殺我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. And this is bad.
→ {"text": "這太糟了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. That wasn't the case.
→ {"text": "但事實並非如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. So you know, I wake up the next day.
→ {"text": "所以你知道，我隔天醒來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. And I'm just freaking out.
→ {"text": "我整個嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. I had to go to work at 6 o'clock in the morning at a hardware store that I worked at.
→ {"text": "我必須早上六點去我工作的五金行上班。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. And I can't call in sick and say, hey I was abducted by aliens last night.
→ {"text": "我不能請病假說，嘿，我昨晚被外星人綁架了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. Can I not come in to work today?
→ {"text": "我今天可以不去上班嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. Yeah, so that was my most profound--
→ {"text": "對，所以那是我最深刻的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

622. Yeah, that's--
→ {"text": "對，那真是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

623. --experiences.
→ {"text": "——體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

624. I found out later they were just repairing the damage that was done to my brain through being diagnosed with ADD and having the anti-depressants my whole life.
→ {"text": "我後來才知道，他們只是在修復我大腦的損傷，那些損傷是因為我被診斷出注意力不足症，然後一輩子都在吃抗憂鬱藥物所造成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ADD = 注意力不足症"}

625. And they were just repairing the damage that was--
→ {"text": "他們只是在修復那些損傷——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

626. Wow, they're repairing the pharmaceutical damage.
→ {"text": "哇，他們在修復藥物造成的傷害。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

627. Correct.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

629. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

630. And I had a similar experience where they went into my brain as well to recalibrate, they told me, that they had to reset, and recalibrate some things after something I had gone through physically, with hitting my head.
→ {"text": "我也有類似的經歷，他們也進入我的大腦進行重新校準，他們告訴我，在我經歷了某些身體創傷——撞到頭之後，他們必須重置並重新校準一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. And so it's a really-- and I was awake.
→ {"text": "所以這真的很——而且我是清醒的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

632. I mean, I was very aware of it.
→ {"text": "我是說，我非常清楚地意識到這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

633. It's such a weird feeling because I could see my brain.
→ {"text": "那感覺非常奇怪，因為我能看到我的大腦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. And I knew what they were doing, so I was OK.
→ {"text": "而且我知道他們在做什麼，所以我還好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. But they had their hands in my brain and just shifting some things around.
→ {"text": "但他們把手伸進我的大腦裡，就這樣移動一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. And they said, it's all OK.
→ {"text": "他們說，一切都沒事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. And I really trusted that.
→ {"text": "我真的相信他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. And they actually levitated me above my bed several times when I was still getting into all this.
→ {"text": "而且當我還在適應這一切時，他們實際上好幾次把我懸浮在床上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. Because they came one night to recalibrate me.
→ {"text": "因為有一晚他們來為我重新校準。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

640. And I was like not as OK.
→ {"text": "而我當時並不是那麼好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

641. I mean, we've all been through our fear.
→ {"text": "我是說，我們都經歷過恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

642. Even though we're hybrids and that, we're like anybody else.
→ {"text": "即使我們是混種，我們也跟其他人一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

643. We've been through our stuff.
→ {"text": "我們也經歷過我們的困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. And so they showed up in my room.
→ {"text": "所以他們出現在我的房間裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. And I was in bed.
→ {"text": "我在床上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. And I started running for the door, thinking-- I couldn't open the door.
→ {"text": "我開始往門那邊跑，心想——我打不開門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. I couldn't.
→ {"text": "我打不開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. And they levitated me, like, five feet up over my bed.
→ {"text": "然後他們把我懸浮起來，大概離床五英尺高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

649. And I'm just, like, being levitated.
→ {"text": "我就這樣被懸浮著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. And they said, do you think you can calm down now?
→ {"text": "他們說，你現在能冷靜下來了嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

651. And I just was on the bed, paralyzed.
→ {"text": "然後我就在床上，動彈不得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. And then I was gone.
→ {"text": "然後我就消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

653. So the next night, they came again.
→ {"text": "所以隔天晚上，他們又來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. And I got up to run again.
→ {"text": "我又起身要跑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. And they said, are we going to go through this again?
→ {"text": "他們說，我們要再來一次嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. And I went, no.
→ {"text": "我說，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. And I turned around and went back into the bed.
→ {"text": "然後我轉身回到床上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. And then I was just gone again.
→ {"text": "然後我又消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. But we've had to work through our fear of it.
→ {"text": "但我們必須克服對它的恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. Oh, my gosh, I was being levitated.
→ {"text": "天啊，我被懸浮起來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. Are you kidding me?
→ {"text": "你在跟我開玩笑嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

662. Yeah, that's terrifying.
→ {"text": "對，那太可怕了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

663. I was terrified.
→ {"text": "我嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. And they said, this is what we're going to say to you.
→ {"text": "然後他們說，我們要跟你說這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. If a parent's child has had something go wrong and they need to be taken to the hospital to be administered to, and the child's kicking and screaming, saying, I don't want to go, but what is the parent going to do in the end?
→ {"text": "如果一個父母的孩子出了問題，需要被帶到醫院接受治療，而孩子又踢又叫，說我不想去，但父母最後會怎麼做?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. We're going to take the child to the hospital.
→ {"text": "我們還是會把孩子帶到醫院。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. And they said, that's basically what we need to do with you and to get some things-- your frequencies recalibrated in your brain.
→ {"text": "他們說，這基本上就是我們需要對你做的事，為了讓一些事情——你大腦裡的頻率重新校準。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. And so they reset me.
→ {"text": "所以他們重置了我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. And that made me feel better.
→ {"text": "這讓我感覺好多了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. And I knew they were loving, compassionate, and kind.
→ {"text": "而且我知道他們是有愛的、慈悲的、仁慈的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. It's that human response, even if you don't want to.
→ {"text": "這就是人類的反應，即使你不想這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. But after that, I have no trouble with experiences now.
→ {"text": "但在那之後，我現在對這些體驗完全不擔心了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. I'm just like, hey--
→ {"text": "我就像是，嘿——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

674. Love the experience.
→ {"text": "愛這些體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

675. Good to see you.
→ {"text": "很高興見到你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

676. And experiencing--
→ {"text": "而且體驗——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

677. Let's go.
→ {"text": "走吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

678. I crave them, yeah.
→ {"text": "我渴望這些體驗，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

679. I'm ready to visit the ship.
→ {"text": "我準備好去飛船了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

680. Let's go.
→ {"text": "走吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. But we all go through our fear experiences too before we fully know who we are.
→ {"text": "但在我們完全知道自己是誰之前，我們都要經歷恐懼的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

682. The thing is, as a human, we experience the traumas of--
→ {"text": "問題是，身為人類，我們經歷創傷——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

683. Oh, just--
→ {"text": "哦，就是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

684. Oh, my god, just this crazy-- Everyone I know is-- I think all of humanity has PTSD.
→ {"text": "天啊，就是這麼瘋狂——我認識的每個人都——我覺得全人類都有創傷後壓力症候群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "PTSD = 創傷後壓力症候群"}


## Speaker Group 194

685. Yeah, I mean, seriously.
→ {"text": "對，我是說，真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

686. I did.
→ {"text": "我有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

687. And now we're getting PTSD from the drugs we're taking for the PTSD.
→ {"text": "而現在我們又因為治療創傷後壓力症候群的藥物而得到創傷後壓力症候群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

688. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

689. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

690. Yeah, but it took me a while to process all of that.
→ {"text": "對，但我花了一段時間才處理完這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

691. I mean, the next day I was like-- you know.
→ {"text": "我是說，隔天我就像——你懂的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. But it's all a matter of perspective.
→ {"text": "但這完全是視角的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. I really want to say this, is that some people might be freaked out the rest of their life from that, saying they're evil.
→ {"text": "我真的想說的是，有些人可能會因為這種經歷而餘生都嚇壞了，說他們是邪惡的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

694. They levitated me.
→ {"text": "他們把我懸浮起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. They paralyzed me.
→ {"text": "他們讓我動彈不得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. They took me.
→ {"text": "他們帶走我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. Who knows what they did to me?
→ {"text": "誰知道他們對我做了什麼?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

698. That could be one perspective of the victim.
→ {"text": "這可能是受害者的一種視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. And I don't choose to be a victim.
→ {"text": "而我不選擇當受害者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. I'm a part of this.
→ {"text": "我是其中的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. My soul volunteered to do this.
