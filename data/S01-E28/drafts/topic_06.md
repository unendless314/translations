420. So speaking of the mission then, let's get into that.
→ {"text": "那麼說到使命的部分，我們來聊聊這個吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. What is the mission?
→ {"text": "使命是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. Why this contact?
→ {"text": "為什麼會有這些接觸？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. Why the hybridization?
→ {"text": "為什麼要混種化？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. Why-- what's going on?
→ {"text": "到底是怎麼回事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

425. It's really a multi-dimensional thing, right?
→ {"text": "這其實是個多維度的事情，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. So there's many, many layers and different aspects to why.
→ {"text": "所以「為什麼」有著許許多多的層次和不同面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. One of the reasons why, for me anyways, they had to do a little bit of the tweaking so that way, my consciousness could incarnate into this body, right?
→ {"text": "其中一個原因是，至少對我來說，他們必須做一點調整，這樣我的意識才能投生進這個身體，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. Now, that doesn't make me-- in all reality, it doesn't make me much different from me and you because when it happens, I have the same thing.
→ {"text": "不過這並不會讓我——事實上，這並不會讓我跟你我有什麼太大不同，因為當這件事發生時，我也經歷同樣的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. I forget.
→ {"text": "我會遺忘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. I don't have any memory of this.
→ {"text": "我對這些沒有任何記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. So what happens if, like, you want to understand what it is to be-- let's see-- an ant, for an example, right?
→ {"text": "所以如果你想理解當一隻——比如說——螞蟻是什麼感覺，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. Well, you would come and live the life of an ant, right?
→ {"text": "那麼，你就得來過一隻螞蟻的生活，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. You can't just like-- you can sit there and study them all you want.
→ {"text": "你不能只是——你可以坐在那裡研究牠們，研究多久都行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. But actually get to understand it is to incarnate as one.
→ {"text": "但要真正理解牠們，就是要投生成一隻螞蟻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

435. Sure.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

436. And it could have the exact same-- not as superpower ant.
→ {"text": "而且會有完全相同的——不是成為超能力螞蟻。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "略為口語化的破碎句，保留語氣"}

437. Sure, some things do bleed through, like some psychic things and whatnot.
→ {"text": "當然，有些東西確實會滲透過來，像是一些靈能之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. But as far as me, it's-- I didn't have the psychicness or any of that.
→ {"text": "但就我而言，我並沒有靈能或任何那類的能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. Well, I'm sure it was there.
→ {"text": "嗯，我相信它是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. I just didn't realize it.
→ {"text": "我只是沒意識到而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. But-- [LAUGHTER] But you know, to live a human experience, to go through the childhood, you know, and the harshness of this reality.
→ {"text": "但是——【笑聲】但你知道，要過人類的生活，要經歷童年，你知道的，還有這個實相的嚴酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. So that way, I can better understand what it is to be a human being, just so I can understand humanity so when they do come to introduce themselves to humanity, they can now figure out how can I do this without completely destroying this civilization.
→ {"text": "這樣我才能更好地理解身為人類是什麼感覺，才能理解人類，所以當他們真的來向人類介紹自己時，他們就能想出該怎麼做才不會完全摧毀這個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. So now, if you go back to the ant analogy here, imagine now you, as a person, looking at an ant colony, right?
→ {"text": "所以現在，如果我們回到螞蟻的比喻，想像一下你，身為一個人，看著一個螞蟻群落，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. And let's say someone came by and kicked the ant hill, right?
→ {"text": "假設有人經過，踢了蟻丘一腳，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. And now, we're coming down, looking at it.
→ {"text": "現在，我們過來往下看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. I mean, as a person, how do I make these ants not go crazy?
→ {"text": "我的意思是，身為一個人，我要怎麼讓這些螞蟻不要抓狂？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. You can't just take your finger, and you put your finger in the ant hill--
→ {"text": "你不能就這樣伸出手指，然後把手指放進蟻丘——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

448. They'll bite it.
→ {"text": "牠們會咬你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

449. They're going to go crazy, you know?
→ {"text": "牠們會抓狂的，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. So you just have to sit back and observe.
→ {"text": "所以你只能往後退，觀察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. And the only way we can-- the only way they can help the ants now is to go in as an ant and tell the ants, hey, guys, don't worry about the big dude up there.
→ {"text": "而我們唯一能做的——他們現在唯一能幫助螞蟻的方式，就是化身為一隻螞蟻進去，然後告訴螞蟻們：嘿，各位，別擔心上面那個大傢伙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Don't worry about it.
→ {"text": "別擔心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. There's no need to panic.
→ {"text": "不需要恐慌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

454. Just rebuild--
→ {"text": "只要重建——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

455. They're only here to help.
→ {"text": "他們只是來幫忙的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

456. Or the big dude up there just wasn't paying attention and kicked over the hill.
→ {"text": "或者上面那個大傢伙只是沒注意，不小心踢倒了蟻丘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

457. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

458. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. So we just gotta rebuild the hill.
→ {"text": "所以我們只需要重建蟻丘就好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

460. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. And so a lot of us come down to help so it's not so frightening.
→ {"text": "所以我們很多人降臨下來幫忙，好讓這一切不那麼可怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And I know it's frightening because I've been through the fear.
→ {"text": "而我知道這很可怕，因為我經歷過那種恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And that was part of my mission, if you will, to go through being ignorant, being-- I mean, I was go, George Bush, you know, at the time, and bomb Saddam.
→ {"text": "而這也是我使命的一部分，可以這麼說，要經歷無知的狀態，成為——我的意思是，我當時支持喬治·布希，你知道的，支持轟炸薩達姆。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "保留當時政治立場的描述"}

464. And I was, like, ignorant, just a typical American.
→ {"text": "我就是那樣無知，就是個典型的美國人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. You know, America, woo!
→ {"text": "你知道的，美國萬歲！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. You know?
→ {"text": "你懂嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

467. Nice.
→ {"text": "厲害。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

468. And then all of a sudden, it's like I said, a ET comes around.
→ {"text": "然後突然之間，就像我說的，一個外星存有出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. And I just-- it scared the daylights out of me.
→ {"text": "而我就是——把我嚇得魂飛魄散。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. And they didn't want-- they didn't like--
→ {"text": "而他們並不想——他們不喜歡——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

471. So you really did.
→ {"text": "所以你真的經歷了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. Most of us sort of have this-- slow, for me, I discovered spirituality and martial arts, and you know, kind of been digesting this stuff.
→ {"text": "我們大多數人都是有這種——緩慢的，對我來說，我接觸到靈性和武術，你知道的，一直在慢慢消化這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. So you went from George Bush to Mantis being.
→ {"text": "所以你從喬治·布希支持者變成了螳螂存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

474. Oh, my god, yeah, a Mantis being.
→ {"text": "我的天啊，對，一個螳螂存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

475. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. And it-- I mean, I believe that most of the human population is completely unaware of and ignorant to the reality of--
→ {"text": "而這——我的意思是，我相信大部分的人類完全不知道也不了解——的實相", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

477. Reality.
→ {"text": "實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

478. Of reality, exactly.
→ {"text": "實相，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

479. What we know reality is.
→ {"text": "我們所知道的實相是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

480. What reality is.
→ {"text": "實相是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

481. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

482. So I ended up becoming a fractal of what I believe what's to come.
→ {"text": "所以我最後成為了我所相信的未來的一個縮影。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. And that's contact with the beings.
→ {"text": "那就是與這些存有的接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. And so what's going to happen at first, when most of the population just has the truth smack him in the face-- you know, the same thing happened to me.
→ {"text": "所以一開始會發生的事情是，當大部分人被真相狠狠打臉時——你知道的，同樣的事情也發生在我身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. The truth smacked me in the face.
→ {"text": "真相狠狠打了我的臉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. So now that I have that experience, I'm able to tell people, it's OK, it's OK.
→ {"text": "所以現在我有了那個經驗，我能夠告訴人們，沒事的，沒事的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. You know, I've worked the steps.
→ {"text": "你知道的，我已經走過那些步驟了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. I've gone through the trials and tribulations.
→ {"text": "我已經經歷過那些考驗和磨難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

489. In a short amount of time it sounds like.
→ {"text": "聽起來在很短的時間內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

490. An extremely short amount of time.
→ {"text": "極短的時間內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

491. Huh.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. Congratulations.
→ {"text": "恭喜你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

493. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

494. You're here.
→ {"text": "你在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. You're alive.
→ {"text": "你還活著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

496. I'm alive.
→ {"text": "我還活著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. And you know, it's been a nightmare.
→ {"text": "而你知道，這一路像場惡夢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. I mean, if you want to get into how it started.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，如果你想談談這一切是怎麼開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. But you know, if you want to do your mission first.
→ {"text": "但你知道，如果你想先談你的使命的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

500. Well, I've been an animal communicator for 36 years professionally.
→ {"text": "嗯，我專業從事動物溝通師工作已經 36 年了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. And I've always been telepathic and psychic.
→ {"text": "而我一直都有心電感應的能力和靈能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. Earlier on, I had dreams that came true, and knew when someone was going to cross over, which was not fun to know sometimes.
→ {"text": "早期，我會做一些成真的夢，而且會知道某人何時會過世，這有時候知道了並不好玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

503. In the-- with the animals?
→ {"text": "是——動物嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. Or with people.
→ {"text": "還是人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

505. With humans because I worked with both people and the animals psychically.
→ {"text": "是人類，因為我用靈能同時為人類和動物服務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. And so it's been a rough road.
→ {"text": "所以這一路走來很艱辛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. And my abilities developed earlier on because I had a near-death experience at six years old.
→ {"text": "而我的能力很早就發展出來了，因為我在六歲時有過一次瀕死體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

508. So I went into all those realms and knew it and came back with that.
→ {"text": "所以我進入了那些所有領域，知道了那些事，然後帶著那些回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. But in terms of that, it unfolded for me in that-- I've been through some very tough stuff in my life, as most of us have, and had another near-death experience in my 20s.
→ {"text": "但就這方面來說，對我的展開是這樣的——我這輩子經歷過一些非常艱難的事情，就像我們大多數人一樣，而且在我二十多歲時又經歷了另一次瀕死體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. And that really set me on my path with all of this.
→ {"text": "而那真正讓我踏上了這一切的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. And so it really kicked me in super high gear into using telepathy.
→ {"text": "所以那真的讓我全速啟動，開始運用心電感應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. I was-- other things were going on psychically as well.
→ {"text": "我當時——其他靈能方面的事情也在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. So I chose to use those energies to communicate with animals and to be of service, to give the animals a voice so people could understand the animals.
→ {"text": "所以我選擇用這些能量與動物溝通，去服務他人，給動物一個聲音，讓人們能夠理解動物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. And then I was working psychically with people as well, doing psychic readings for people.
→ {"text": "然後我也用靈能為人們服務，為人們做靈性解讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. And then when I fully realized I had the ET frequencies and all of that, then I started opening and really unfolding.
→ {"text": "然後當我完全意識到我有外星存有的頻率和所有那些時，我就開始打開並真正展開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. Things started unfolding for me to get into that.
→ {"text": "事情開始展開，讓我進入那個領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. And so I see my mission as giving the message that we are all one and helping people to get in touch with who they are.
→ {"text": "所以我認為我的使命就是傳遞我們都是一體的訊息，並幫助人們接觸到真正的自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Because the star readings I do helps their star families show up.
→ {"text": "因為我做的星際起源解讀能幫助他們的星際家族顯現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. And I just get them connected and give messages and give them tone mantras to do that really connect.
→ {"text": "而我只是讓他們連結，並傳遞訊息，給他們音調咒語來真正建立連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. So I love doing that.
→ {"text": "所以我很喜歡做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. It's great fun.
→ {"text": "這非常有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. And also, I'm a certified hypnotherapist and work with experiencers to help them process their experiences because I've been through it all, I mean, really with positive experience with beings, not so positive experiences with beings.
→ {"text": "而且，我也是一位認證催眠治療師，與體驗者合作，幫助他們處理自己的經驗，因為我已經經歷過所有這一切，我的意思是，真的，有與存有們的正面經驗，也有不那麼正面的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. And I certainly understand the human experience pretty much from A to Z, I can say.
→ {"text": "而我可以說，我確實理解人類的經驗，從頭到尾都理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

524. It's a pretty wide spectrum.
→ {"text": "這是個相當廣泛的光譜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

525. It's been an interesting life.
→ {"text": "這一生很有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. And I'm glad I'm at where I am at and so grateful to be here and have many miracles.
→ {"text": "而我很高興我現在在這裡，非常感恩能在這裡，而且經歷了許多奇蹟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. I mean, I have had two NDEs.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我經歷過兩次瀕死體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. And another time, I almost died about 11 years ago.
→ {"text": "還有另一次，我在大約 11 年前差點死掉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. So it's been quite a walk.
→ {"text": "所以這一路走來相當不容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

530. Is that from an actual physical event and then--
→ {"text": "那是因為實際的物質事件，然後——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

531. Yeah, just some-- yeah.
→ {"text": "對，就是一些——對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

532. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

533. So I've had a lot of miracles in order to stay here and continue sharing.
→ {"text": "所以我經歷了許多奇蹟才能留在這裡並繼續分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. I love sharing with people and talking about all of this and about star beings and sharing about the different kinds of cultures of star beings and their languages and symbols.
→ {"text": "我熱愛與人們分享，談論所有這一切，談論星際存有，分享不同星際存有的文化、語言和符號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. And so I'm doing a lot of that now, light language and symbols with people.
→ {"text": "所以我現在做很多這方面的工作，與人們一起運用光之語和符號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. And that's-- I can't think of anything to do that would be more fun.
→ {"text": "而這——我想不出還有什麼事情會比這更有趣了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

537. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
