368. And now, of these two Americans, we meet.

369. And oh, not only are we two Americans, but we're from the same state or from the same town.
→ {"text": "而且，哦，我們不僅都是美國人，還來自同一個州、甚至同一個小鎮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. So we have this really, really unique connection that Russians wouldn't be able to understand.

371. This is the exact same feeling, you know.

381. Or is it more intuitive?
→ {"text": "還是比較像直覺式的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

382. It's more of a frequency.

383. If you think about it, they don't really talk in a language.

384. It's more of a frequency.
→ {"text": "更像是一種頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 111

392. Of the energy.

412. Harsh words meaning English being harsh words?
→ {"text": "粗糙的詞彙是指英語是粗糙的詞彙嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

413. Because the vibration of our language is a third dimensional language, so if you imagine, it would be like someone who listens to Mozart now having death metal played in their ear.
→ {"text": "因為我們語言的頻率是三維語言，所以你想像一下，就像一個平常聽莫札特的人，突然耳邊響起死亡金屬樂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
