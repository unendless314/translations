223. Would you have any idea of what dimension or density that the majority of these beings reside in?
→ {"text": "你知道這些存有大部分居住在什麼維度或密度嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

224. Well, you're asking about the Mantis.
→ {"text": "嗯，你是在問螳螂族的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

225. Yes, the Mantis being.
→ {"text": "對，螳螂存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

226. From my perspective-- and again, there's different species that are in different frequencies.
→ {"text": "從我的角度來看——再說一次，不同物種處於不同的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

227. Yeah.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

228. Those who I interact with, I would classify them more with the angelic realm definitely.
→ {"text": "我接觸的那些，我會將他們明確歸類為天使界域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. And when they appear to people sometimes, they will appear with the wings to not scare people.
→ {"text": "有時候當他們向人們顯現時，會帶著翅膀出現，以免嚇到人們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. And they're not truly wings.
→ {"text": "而那並不是真正的翅膀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. It's their energy around them.
→ {"text": "那是他們周圍的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. But that's how highly evolved they are.
→ {"text": "這就顯示出他們進化得有多高等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

233. So it's almost beyond physical form in a collective.
→ {"text": "所以他們幾乎超越了物質的形式，以集體的方式存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

234. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

236. The best way to describe it, it's like a drop of water in an ocean of consciousness is what it is really.
→ {"text": "最好的形容方式，就像是意識海洋中的一滴水，實際上就是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. And there is a singular consciousness amongst them.
→ {"text": "而他們之間有一種單一的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. But they do have a-- it's not a hive mind.
→ {"text": "但他們確實有一種——那不是蜂巢心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. It's a collective.
→ {"text": "是一種集體意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

240. A collective.
→ {"text": "集體意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

241. It's like an ocean of consciousness.
→ {"text": "就像是一片意識的海洋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

242. Yeah, we've explored-- in past episodes we've explored Peleiadian collectives, different densities and dimensions of the collectives.
→ {"text": "是啊，我們探討過——在過去的集數中，我們探討過昴宿星人的集體，集體意識的不同密度和維度。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Peleiadian 拼寫似乎是 Pleiadian 的誤拼"}

243. And it sort of seems that from seventh and beyond, individuals sort of lose their-- they don't lose it.
→ {"text": "而且似乎從第七密度以上，個體會失去他們的——他們並沒有失去它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. They still have their individual experiences and ideas.
→ {"text": "他們仍然有自己的個體經驗和想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. But then they start operating from a collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "但他們開始從集體意識的層面運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

246. Well, and there's no ego involved.
→ {"text": "嗯，而且不涉及小我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Humanity, we have the ego, and we need the ego here.
→ {"text": "人類，我們有小我，而且我們在這裡需要小我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. But they don't.
→ {"text": "但他們不需要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. It's a whole 'nother experience--
→ {"text": "那是完全不同的體驗——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

250. Yeah, it is a weight--
→ {"text": "是啊，那是一種負擔——", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "可能指小我是一種重擔"}


## Speaker Group 69

251. --without the ego, they understand, they know the oneness.
→ {"text": "——沒有小我，他們明白，他們知道合一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. We do too.
→ {"text": "我們也是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. You know, everyone really does.
→ {"text": "你知道的，每個人其實都知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. It's remembering.
→ {"text": "只是要記起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. But it's just there all the time.
→ {"text": "但它一直都在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. It's a oneness, the love, the harmony, the peace.
→ {"text": "那是合一、愛、和諧、平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

257. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. It's a curious-- you know, it's infinite curiosity is what it is.
→ {"text": "這是一種好奇——你知道的，這是無限的好奇心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. Because--
→ {"text": "因為——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

260. Curiosity on their behalf or--
→ {"text": "是他們的好奇心還是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

261. They-- they're just curious.
→ {"text": "他們——他們就是好奇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. And it gets into how the universe was created and why we're all curious.
→ {"text": "這牽涉到宇宙是如何被創造的，以及為什麼我們都充滿好奇心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

263. We're all curious.
→ {"text": "我們都充滿好奇心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

264. It's interesting.
→ {"text": "這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. The download I got-- and you mentioned angels.
→ {"text": "我收到的下載訊息——你提到了天使。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. So I sort of made the correlation.
→ {"text": "所以我就做了這個連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. So this-- the visitation I had was on the lunar eclipse.
→ {"text": "所以這個——我遇到的造訪是在月蝕的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

268. What perfect timing.
→ {"text": "多麼完美的時機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

269. Yeah, when was it, the end of September last year?
→ {"text": "是啊，那是什麼時候，去年九月底嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

270. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

272. And it went on for a couple hours.
→ {"text": "而且持續了好幾個小時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. And I was shaking and got a full on experience.
→ {"text": "我當時在顫抖，得到了完整的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. And I've never had-- I've been doing this kind of work and interviews and everything and ET realms for a long time, but I've never had a personal experience.
→ {"text": "而我從來沒有——我做這類工作、訪談、還有外星領域的事已經很久了，但我從來沒有過個人的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

275. That's wonderful.
→ {"text": "那太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

276. And I was sort of getting this download of the creation not of the universe but of the human experience.
→ {"text": "我當時接收到的下載訊息，是關於創造的，不是宇宙的創造，而是人類體驗的創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. And then I related-- so the Zetas came up, the Grays, and also, a lot of Reptilian stuff came up.
→ {"text": "然後我聯想到——所以網罟座出現了，小灰人，還有很多爬蟲人的事情也出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. And I sort of saw-- they were presenting to me telepathically images of-- and what I was I guess translating in my own-- with these images, having to translate, and feelings, and all sorts of stuff was happening.
→ {"text": "而我看到——他們以心電感應的方式向我呈現影像——而我當時用自己的方式在轉譯——這些影像，需要轉譯，還有感受，各種事情都在發生。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構複雜，保留了原文的斷續感"}

279. But I saw how Reptilians saw them as Angels.
→ {"text": "但我看到了爬蟲人如何將他們視為天使。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. Does that resonate?
→ {"text": "你有共鳴嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

281. Yeah, if you think about it, you know, you hear a lot of abduction experiences where the Mantis beings always playing an observer role.
→ {"text": "是啊，如果你想想看，你知道的，你會聽到很多綁架體驗，螳螂族存有總是扮演觀察者的角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. They work with every-- all the beings, all of them.
→ {"text": "他們與每一個——所有的存有，全部都合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. They don't like to-- they don't interfere with the other races so much, you know?
→ {"text": "他們不喜歡——他們不太干涉其他種族，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. They're just they're mostly to observe, to understand every aspect of creation.
→ {"text": "他們主要就是觀察，去理解創造的每一個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. And so a lot of the time, they're just there as observers.
→ {"text": "所以很多時候，他們就只是在那裡當觀察者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

286. Yeah, that's-- I got that there was a distress call from the Reptilians in a way that they wanted to evolve, I guess, out of their Reptilian archetypal structure.
→ {"text": "是啊，那個——我得到的訊息是爬蟲人發出了求救訊號，某種程度上他們想要進化，我猜，脫離他們爬蟲人的原型結構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. And in order to do so, they called upon the Mantis, just like we would pray to an Angel in that sense.
→ {"text": "為了做到這一點，他們召喚了螳螂族，就像我們會向天使祈禱那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. And then the Mantis beings came in.
→ {"text": "然後螳螂族存有就來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. And I guess that's how the human experience was formed, to help the evolution of this Reptilian consciousness.
→ {"text": "而我猜這就是人類體驗形成的方式，為了協助這個爬蟲人意識的進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

290. They also have-- I do know they also have-- they have symbiotic relationships with a lot of beings too because for an example, there's is a race of beings.
→ {"text": "他們也有——我確實知道他們也有——他們與很多存有都有共生關係，因為舉例來說，有一個存有種族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. They would look like a Gray.
→ {"text": "他們看起來像小灰人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. They look just like a Gray, except for the ones that I've seen there, they have a small head.
→ {"text": "他們看起來就像小灰人，只不過我看到的那些，他們的頭比較小。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. They're really short, like, three feet tall, wear a black jumpsuit type thing.
→ {"text": "他們真的很矮，大概三英尺高，穿著黑色連身衣之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. They have these lines on their faces that are just like wrinkles.
→ {"text": "他們臉上有這些線條，就像皺紋一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. And they were created so that way, the Mantis beings can interact with lower dimensions sometimes.
→ {"text": "而他們被創造出來，是為了讓螳螂族存有有時可以與較低的維度互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. A lot of times, when the Mantis work with me, these little Gray guys, who act as a barrier of-- because I've had an experience where I was eating.
→ {"text": "很多時候，當螳螂族與我合作時，這些小灰人會充當一種屏障——因為我曾經有過一次體驗，當時我在吃東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. My wife made some jalapeno-- bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers.
→ {"text": "我太太做了一些墨西哥辣椒——培根包裹的辣椒小點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. She put the toothpick into it.
→ {"text": "她把牙籤插進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. And I was just gobbling them down.
→ {"text": "而我就狼吞虎嚥地吃掉它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. And I accidentally swallowed a toothpick.
→ {"text": "結果我不小心吞下了一根牙籤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

301. Oh, no.
→ {"text": "哦，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

302. And so-- I was like, OK, well, it doesn't hurt me now.
→ {"text": "所以——我就想，好吧，現在還不會痛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. I had a little upset stomach, but I'm going to have to deal with this tomorrow.
→ {"text": "我有點胃不舒服，但我明天再來處理這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. It's like 12 o'clock at night.
→ {"text": "已經是晚上十二點了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. I mean, I'm really bad about going to the doctor when I'm supposed to.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我真的很不喜歡在該去看醫生的時候去看醫生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. But next thing I know, I feel-- my body starts stretching out.
→ {"text": "但接下來我知道的是，我感覺到——我的身體開始伸展開來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. And I'll see these little beings walk in and the Mantis being behind them.
→ {"text": "然後我看到這些小存有走進來，螳螂存有在他們後面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. The Mantis being says, you know, this is going to feel weird.
→ {"text": "螳螂存有說，你知道的，這會感覺很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. And the little guy puts his hand in my stomach, and it goes into my stomach.
→ {"text": "然後那個小傢伙把他的手放進我的胃裡，它就進到我的胃裡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. If you've ever a hand go into your stomach, it's the weirdest feeling ever.
→ {"text": "如果你曾經有手進到你的胃裡，那是有史以來最怪的感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. So I snapped out of it, out of my paralysis.
→ {"text": "所以我突然清醒過來，擺脫了我的癱瘓狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. And I grabbed the being by the head.
→ {"text": "然後我抓住了那個存有的頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. And I had my thumb in it's mouth, you know?
→ {"text": "而我的拇指在它的嘴裡，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. And it's chewing on my thumb.
→ {"text": "而它在咀嚼我的拇指。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. I could feel it's little gums, and it's saliva, and it's soft skin.
→ {"text": "我可以感覺到它的小牙齦、它的唾液、還有它柔軟的皮膚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. And the Mantis being just waves it's hand over me.
→ {"text": "而螳螂存有就在我身上揮了揮手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. And the next thing I know, I'm having a dream where I'm chasing butterflies.
→ {"text": "接下來我知道的是，我在做一個夢，夢裡我在追逐蝴蝶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

318. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

319. So the Mantis being, they've evolved to the point where their minds can manipulate matter.
→ {"text": "所以螳螂存有，他們已經進化到他們的心智可以操控物質的程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. So let's take this pillow--
→ {"text": "所以讓我們以這個枕頭為例——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

321. Levitate.
→ {"text": "懸浮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

322. Let's take this pillow for an example, right?
→ {"text": "讓我們以這個枕頭為例，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. They have the ability to make the electrons and atoms in this pillow move to match their frequency.
→ {"text": "他們有能力讓這個枕頭裡的電子和原子移動，以配合他們的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. And so they can just move through it.
→ {"text": "所以他們就可以直接穿過它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. So it's all-- they're just masters of the universe.
→ {"text": "所以這一切——他們就是宇宙的大師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. So they don't even really need technology.
→ {"text": "所以他們甚至根本不需要科技。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

327. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

328. And the work that they do with the Reptilians is-- like, they need this, and helping them evolve and just to observe everything.
→ {"text": "而他們與爬蟲人所做的工作是——就像，他們需要這個，協助他們進化，以及單純地觀察一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

329. So did you get the toothpick out?
→ {"text": "所以你把牙籤弄出來了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

330. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. It was out.
→ {"text": "它出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. It did get out.
→ {"text": "確實出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. That was fine.
→ {"text": "那就沒事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. But what a weird feeling, having a hand digging in your stomach.
→ {"text": "但那真是一種奇怪的感覺，有一隻手在你的胃裡挖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. Oh, weird.
→ {"text": "哦，真怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
