102. OK, well, speaking of Mantis beings, I've had sort of a personal experience recently with them.
→ {"text": "好，說到螳螂族存有，我最近剛好有過一次與他們的親身體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. And it's interesting because I haven't-- during all these interviews I do with different ET collectives and individuals, you know, you hear about the Zeta Reticuli, the Pleiades, the Arcturus and even Reptilians.
→ {"text": "很有意思的是，在我訪談過的各種外星集體與個體中，你會聽到網罟座、昴宿星、大角星，甚至爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. But the Mantis hadn't really been in my radar.
→ {"text": "但螳螂族卻不太在我的視野範圍內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. And then I had this experience with this Mantis energy.
→ {"text": "然後我就體驗到了這股螳螂族的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. That's all I can say, you know.
→ {"text": "我只能這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. I identified it as the Mantis because I had seen-- in this world, you read and it pops up every now and then.
→ {"text": "我之所以認出那是螳螂族，是因為在這個領域裡讀資料時，偶爾會看到他們被提及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. But it hasn't been really explored and discussed.
→ {"text": "但從來沒有被真正深入探討過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. So I'd really like to sort of get your viewpoints on what are the Mantis beings.
→ {"text": "所以我很想聽聽你們的看法，螳螂族存有到底是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. What do they-- why are they interacting with humans in this way?
→ {"text": "他們為什麼會以這種方式與人類互動?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. And sort of just your personal take on that energy.
→ {"text": "還有你們對那股能量的個人感受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

112. I've noticed that too when I was starting to do my research on the subject, trying to figure out what was going on with me.
→ {"text": "我當初開始研究這個主題、試著搞清楚自己發生了什麼事時，也注意到了這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. I noticed that there is not a lot of information out there about the Mantis beings at all.
→ {"text": "我發現關於螳螂族存有的資訊真的非常少。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. You know, there is that the Mantis beings created the Gray race, you know.
→ {"text": "你知道，有一種說法是螳螂族存有創造了小灰人這個種族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. But--
→ {"text": "但是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

116. I didn't hear that.
→ {"text": "我沒聽過這個說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. But that resonates now with the download that I got.
→ {"text": "但這跟我接收到的訊息有所共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. So thank you for sharing.
→ {"text": "謝謝你的分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

119. So what I understand from the Mantis beings is that, there's many praying mantis insects running around, different species, different looks, different-- and it's the same out there.
→ {"text": "關於螳螂族存有，我的理解是，地球上有各種不同種類的螳螂昆蟲到處跑來跑去，不同的物種、不同的外觀——在宇宙中也是一樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. But from what I understand is that they were here at the very beginning.
→ {"text": "但就我的理解，他們從一開始就在了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. You know, they were, like, one of the first aspects of creation in the universe, of physical creation.
→ {"text": "他們可以說是宇宙中最早被創造出來的面向之一，是物質創造的最初形式之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. If you think everything is kind of like a fractal, right, of the whole, you know, here on Earth, if you think of Earth as far as humanity knows how evolution went, you first have your bacterial life and then more complex forms.
→ {"text": "如果你把一切想像成整體的某種碎形結構，就拿地球來說，以人類所知的演化歷程來看，一開始是細菌生命，然後是更複雜的形式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. And then finally, you get into the insects, and then the amphibians and the reptiles, right?
→ {"text": "然後才出現昆蟲、兩棲類、爬蟲類，對吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Because the conditions are harsh.
→ {"text": "因為環境條件很嚴苛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. So you need that exoskeleton first.
→ {"text": "所以你需要先有外骨骼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. So I believe-- and that's where you're more negative Mantis being comes from.
→ {"text": "所以我相信——那些比較負面的螳螂族存有就是來自那個階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. It's just-- the universe is just created.
→ {"text": "宇宙才剛剛被創造出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. And it's chaos.
→ {"text": "一片混沌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. It's--
→ {"text": "而且——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

130. Survival of the fittest.
→ {"text": "適者生存。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

131. --radioactive.
→ {"text": "充滿輻射。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. It's survival of the fittest, you know, so I believe that's where your negative Mantis comes from.
→ {"text": "適者生存，所以我相信那些負面的螳螂族就是源自那個時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. Then they evolve to the next stage, where now, they're not so negative, you know?
→ {"text": "然後他們進化到下一個階段，這時候就不那麼負面了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. And then evolve to the next stage, to the next stage, and to the next stage.
→ {"text": "然後一階段接一階段地不斷進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. But since there they've been evolving for countless billions of years, they exist on every single level simultaneously because as we know it, time is more circular than it is linear, as we experience it.
→ {"text": "但由於他們已經進化了數十億年，他們同時存在於每一個層次上，因為我們知道，時間其實更像是循環的，而不是我們所體驗到的線性流動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. So they exist just on every level simultaneously.
→ {"text": "所以他們同時存在於每一個層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. The ones that we interact with, they've evolved beyond their exoskeleton.
→ {"text": "我們所接觸的那些螳螂族，已經進化到超越外骨骼的階段了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. So they don't have the harder shell anymore.
→ {"text": "他們不再有堅硬的外殼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. And they're extremely benevolent and extremely loving.
→ {"text": "而且他們極度慈悲、極度有愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. The reason why they're here interacting with Earth, these are creator beings.
→ {"text": "他們之所以會與地球互動，是因為他們是創造者存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. If you imagine, they're so evolved that just one of their consciousness has the ability to be aware of everyone's conscious-- every living things' conscious on the planet.
→ {"text": "你可以想像，他們已經進化到只要一個意識體，就有能力覺察到這個星球上每個生命體的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. It can literally encompass an entire galaxy, whereas we can only experience and comprehend these walls around us.
→ {"text": "他們的意識可以涵蓋整個銀河系，而我們只能體驗和理解周圍這些牆壁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. Because I can only see and perceive what's around me.
→ {"text": "因為我只能看見和感知我身邊的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. They have the ability to perceive galaxies, you know.
→ {"text": "而他們有能力感知整個星系。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. So they're just here.
→ {"text": "所以他們就在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. I think they're just here mostly to observe but just to help.
→ {"text": "我覺得他們在這裡主要是觀察，但也是來幫忙的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. And alls they want to do is help humanity evolve.
→ {"text": "他們所想做的就是幫助人類進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And they also want to help create new divine expressions of creation.
→ {"text": "他們也想幫助創造新的神聖創造表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. So that's pretty much why they're here.
→ {"text": "所以這大概就是他們為什麼會在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

150. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. Jacquelin, you want to piggyback off of that?
→ {"text": "潔克琳，妳想補充什麼嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

152. Yeah, I've had a lot of interaction with the Mantis beings.
→ {"text": "是的，我跟螳螂族存有有很多互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. And when they come and talk to me-- and also, I do star origin readings for people.
→ {"text": "當他們來跟我說話時——而且我也會為人們做星際起源解讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. So a lot of the times-- well, a number of times, those people will be Mantis.
→ {"text": "所以很多時候——嗯，有好幾次，那些人會是螳螂族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. So I get to have the interaction with different types of Mantis beings.
→ {"text": "所以我有機會跟不同類型的螳螂族存有互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. And then I'm clairvoyant so they show me where they're from.
→ {"text": "而且我是靈視者，所以他們會讓我看見他們來自哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. And actually, I go there from that frequency, I'll call it.
→ {"text": "事實上，我會透過那個頻率去到那裡，我是這麼稱呼的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. And what they have shared with me is-- I agree in that they are very, very highly-- one of the most-- I believe, one of the most highly evolved cultures, and that they did certainly have a hand in creating, and creation, in creating the universe as we know it.
→ {"text": "他們與我分享的是——我同意他們是非常非常高度——我相信是最高度進化的文明之一，而且他們確實參與了創造，參與了我們所知的這個宇宙的創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. And some other races do as well.
→ {"text": "當然也有其他種族參與了創造。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. But the Mantis, they are very highly evolved beings, incredible healers.
→ {"text": "但螳螂族，他們是非常高度進化的存有，是不可思議的療癒者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. And they're very playful.
→ {"text": "而且他們非常愛玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. They love to laugh and have fun.
→ {"text": "他們喜歡笑、喜歡開心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. So they show up at my house all the time.
→ {"text": "所以他們常常出現在我家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. And I-- they like to dance.
→ {"text": "而且我——他們喜歡跳舞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. It sounds silly, but they like to do movements.
→ {"text": "聽起來有點傻，但他們喜歡做一些動作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. And one morning I was actually laying in bed.
→ {"text": "有一天早上，我其實還躺在床上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. And eight of them showed up in my bedroom.
→ {"text": "然後八個螳螂族出現在我的臥室裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. This was very calming for me.
→ {"text": "這對我來說非常平靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. And I go, good morning.
→ {"text": "然後我說，早安。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. And they said, we would love for you to get up and move with us, or some people might say dance.
→ {"text": "他們說，我們希望妳起床跟我們一起動起來，或者有些人會說是跳舞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. And that sounds kind of silly.
→ {"text": "這聽起來有點傻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. But they have--
→ {"text": "但他們——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

174. A little more than exercise.
→ {"text": "可不只是運動而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

175. Any being that has evolved understands play, the concept of play and joy and laughter.
→ {"text": "任何已經進化的存有都懂得玩耍，懂得玩樂、喜悅與歡笑的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. And I said, oh, I don't want to, but I will.
→ {"text": "然後我說，喔，我不想，但我會照做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

177. [LAUGHS] Talk about getting dragged out of bed in the morning.
→ {"text": "【笑聲】真的是早上被拖下床啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

178. I was.
→ {"text": "我真的是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. I was dragged out.
→ {"text": "我被拖下床了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

180. Could they at least make you coffee?
→ {"text": "他們至少能給妳泡杯咖啡吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

181. I was complaining.
→ {"text": "我當時在抱怨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. And so I got out of bed, OK.
→ {"text": "所以我起床了，好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. And I started moving.
→ {"text": "然後我開始動起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. And my whole neck snapped.
→ {"text": "然後我整個脖子喀嚓一聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. My whole spinal column aligned, and my whole neck snapped.
→ {"text": "我整條脊椎對齊了，整個脖子喀嚓一聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. And they had aligned my whole spinal column and neck just like that.
→ {"text": "他們就這樣讓我整條脊椎和脖子都對齊了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

187. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

188. And so I thanked them for that.
→ {"text": "所以我感謝了他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

189. So like a cosmic chiropractic appointment.
→ {"text": "所以就像一次宇宙整脊療程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

190. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

191. And so they interact.
→ {"text": "所以他們會互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. And they come to me, and I draw a lot of the symbols they give me to share with others.
→ {"text": "他們會來找我，而我會畫出很多他們給我的符號，與他人分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. And actually, yes-- so I have interactions with them often.
→ {"text": "事實上，是的——我常常跟他們互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. And even though they're very high creators, and where they come from, where I have visited, they just of course all telepathically communicate, because they're energy.
→ {"text": "儘管他們是非常高階的創造者，而在他們來自的地方，也就是我曾造訪過的地方，他們當然全都是透過心電感應溝通，因為他們就是能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. And they have showed a little about their culture with me.
→ {"text": "而他們向我展示了一些關於他們文化的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. And there's a temple that I've been to at least six times.
→ {"text": "有一座殿堂我至少去過六次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. That's just-- it's like a crystalline temple that's a spiral.
→ {"text": "那就是——像是一座螺旋狀的水晶殿堂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. And they've taken me through, showing this to me.
→ {"text": "他們帶我穿過，向我展示這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. And I've been through the spiral.
→ {"text": "我走過了那個螺旋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. And earlier on, what the Mantis beings did was invite other cultures, other races to come that they felt were ready to come and engage with being a part of a-- it's not really a ritual but with experiencing this crystalline temple where they would go through the spiral.
→ {"text": "在更早的時期，螳螂族存有會邀請他們認為已經準備好的其他文明、其他種族前來，參與——這其實不算是儀式，而是體驗這座水晶殿堂，他們會走過那個螺旋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And it would actually help their DNA to evolve.
→ {"text": "這實際上會幫助他們的 DNA 進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

202. So the actual physical structure of the temple was like a spiral form.
→ {"text": "所以這座殿堂實際的物質結構就是螺旋形的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

203. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. It's-- and it's not density like here.
→ {"text": "那不是像這裡這樣的密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. It's more of an etheric, crystalline frequency.
→ {"text": "更像是一種乙太的、水晶般的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. It's just incredibly beautiful.
→ {"text": "真的美得不可思議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. So I have a very high respect.
→ {"text": "所以我對他們非常尊敬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. But yet, they're very playful and can be very silly and give you information that's just amazing.
→ {"text": "但同時，他們又非常愛玩，可以很傻氣，而且會給你超棒的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. On this New Year's Eve-- I was sharing with Rob that eight of them showed up at my house.
→ {"text": "在這個新年前夕——我跟羅伯分享過，有八個螳螂族出現在我家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. There was a white Mantis being, so there's different species.
→ {"text": "有一個白色的螳螂族存有，所以他們有不同的種類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. Some show up to me as being a neon purple, blue green.
→ {"text": "有些在我面前顯現為霓虹紫色、藍綠色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. There's brown.
→ {"text": "有棕色的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. There's all these different species.
→ {"text": "有各式各樣不同的種類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. So they all showed up.
→ {"text": "所以他們全都出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. And they were around me most of the day.
→ {"text": "他們在我身邊待了大半天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. And I understood they were preparing me to write down this DNA code from them, which I did.
→ {"text": "我明白他們在準備讓我寫下來自他們的 DNA 編碼，而我也照做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. And after I wrote it down, I shook-- my body shook for half an hour because it was such high frequency.
→ {"text": "寫下來之後，我顫抖——我的身體顫抖了半小時，因為那頻率實在太高了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. And I thanked them because I was so moved that I could have the opportunity to allow that, to just sit and come through.
→ {"text": "我感謝他們，因為我太感動了，能有機會允許那一切發生，只是坐著讓它流淌而過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. And actually, it was on the screen when I had given my talk.
→ {"text": "而且事實上，當我演講時，那個畫面就在螢幕上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

220. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "喔，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

221. And actually-- yeah.
→ {"text": "而且事實上——是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. So-- but they're very loving, kind, compassionate fun, fun, fun beings.
→ {"text": "所以——他們是非常有愛、善良、慈悲、有趣、有趣、有趣的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
