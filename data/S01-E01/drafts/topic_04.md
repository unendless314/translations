## Speaker Group 44

161. So right quick, before we introduce the Pleiadians, have you had any physical contact in the light sense?
→ {"text": "那麼在我們介紹昴宿星人之前，先快速問一下，你有過任何物質層面的接觸嗎?在光的意義上?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. I mean, have you seen these lights?
→ {"text": "我的意思是，你看過這些光嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Have you had experiences in that level?
→ {"text": "你在那個層面有過體驗嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

164. With them, my strength is as a clairsentient, so I feel a lot of things in my body.
→ {"text": "對他們而言，我的強項是作為感知者，所以我能在身體中感受到很多東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. I occasionally will see things, as a clairvoyant, literally seeing lights, and auric fields, and that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "我偶爾會以靈視者的身份看見東西，實際看到光、氣場之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. More of what I see in the clairvoyant sense is with my inner eye.
→ {"text": "我在靈視意義上看到的更多是透過我的內在之眼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

167. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. So like eyes closed and just--
→ {"text": "所以像是閉上眼睛，然後就——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

169. Yeah, what I would see in my mind's eye.
→ {"text": "對，就是我在心識之眼中看到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

170. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

171. So when I do see them, they're usually blue, blue light.
→ {"text": "所以當我真的看到他們時，他們通常是藍色的，藍光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. Sometimes they have geometric forms.
→ {"text": "有時候他們會呈現幾何形態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. Sometimes triangles.
→ {"text": "有時是三角形。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

174. Hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. And so let me clarify, so you can see the geometric forms and the lights, but you feel a-- almost like a human presence or something like that?
→ {"text": "那讓我釐清一下，所以你能看到幾何形態和光，但你感受到的是——幾乎像是一種人的存在，或類似的東西?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. How could you describe it?
→ {"text": "你會怎麼描述它?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

177. I feel a frequency.
→ {"text": "我感覺到一種頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

178. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

179. And yet, you could say it's like a human presence.
→ {"text": "但你也可以說這就像是人的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

180. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

181. It's like, well, let's see, how can I--
→ {"text": "這就像是，嗯，讓我想想，我該怎麼——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

182. Like I know my cameraman here is standing here.
→ {"text": "就像我知道這裡的攝影師站在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. Is that--
→ {"text": "這樣——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

184. Yes.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

185. Is that a good analogy?
→ {"text": "這是個好的類比嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

186. So you know what his energy feels like.
→ {"text": "所以你知道他的能量感覺起來是什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

187. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

188. And you wouldn't necessarily have to turn around just to know that that person is standing--
→ {"text": "而且你不一定要回頭，就能知道那個人站在——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

189. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

190. --behind you.
→ {"text": "——你身後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. And they often describe it as it's like hearing somebody's footsteps coming down the hall.
→ {"text": "他們常常形容這就像是聽到某人的腳步聲從走廊傳來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. After a while, once you begin to know what that person's energy is like, what their patterns are like, you know who it is by the sound of--
→ {"text": "過了一陣子，一旦你開始了解那個人的能量是什麼樣子，他們的模式是什麼樣子，你就能從聲音認出那是誰——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

193. Of the footsteps.
→ {"text": "從腳步聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

194. --the footsteps,
→ {"text": "——腳步聲，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

195. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

196. --what the gait's like.
→ {"text": "——步態是什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. So it's kind of the same thing with them.
→ {"text": "所以對他們來說也是類似的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. I know it's them when they show up.
→ {"text": "當他們出現時，我知道是他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. Sometimes they show up with other people.
→ {"text": "有時候他們會和其他存有一起出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. And I can feel them, but I know that they brought other people along because the frequency's different.
→ {"text": "我能感覺到他們，但我知道他們帶了其他存有來，因為頻率不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And sometimes they're making an introduction, so they're beings that I haven't worked with before.
→ {"text": "有時他們是在做介紹，所以是我之前沒有合作過的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

202. And so when we say people, we're talking about other light beings?
→ {"text": "所以當我們說存有的時候，我們是在談論其他光之存有嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

203. Sometimes they're light beings.
→ {"text": "有時候他們是光之存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. Sometimes they're physical.
→ {"text": "有時候他們是物質的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. Sometimes they're fifth dimensional, sixth dimensional, seventh dimensional.
→ {"text": "有時是第五維度、第六維度、第七維度的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And they do have bodies.
→ {"text": "他們確實有身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. They're not as dense as ours, but they do have physical form.
→ {"text": "他們的身體不像我們的這麼稠密，但他們確實有物質的形體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

208. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

209. And I do work with a variety of beings.
→ {"text": "我確實與各式各樣的存有一起工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. The Sirians that I work with, they're physicals.
→ {"text": "我合作的天狼星人，他們是物質的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. They're fifth dimensional.
→ {"text": "他們是第五維度的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. But I don't necessarily work with them in a conscious way where they're standing physically in front of me.
→ {"text": "但我不一定是以有意識的方式與他們工作，就是那種他們實際站在我面前的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. It's more telepathic communication that I have with them, at least in my waking hours.
→ {"text": "更多是心電感應的溝通，至少在我清醒的時候是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

214. And have you had physical contact then with other beings, non-light beings, body--
→ {"text": "那你有和其他存有有過物質接觸嗎，非光之存有，有身體的——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

215. Yes. >> OK.
→ {"text": "有的。>> 好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

216. Yes. So--
→ {"text": "有的。所以——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

217. Sirians?
→ {"text": "天狼星人?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. Or--
→ {"text": "還是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

219. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. Different beings.
→ {"text": "不同的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. Some of them are insectoids.
→ {"text": "其中有些是昆蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

222. Oh, interesting.
→ {"text": "哦，有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

223. And then the Zetas as well.
→ {"text": "還有網罟座人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

224. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

225. And those are my physical experiences.
→ {"text": "這些就是我的物質接觸經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. And another group who I just recently had an introduction to, I don't have all the bits and pieces as to who they are, exactly, but they're kind of a cross between the insectoids and what we would traditionally call the grays.
→ {"text": "還有另一個群體，我最近才剛被介紹認識，我還沒有掌握他們到底是誰的所有細節，但他們有點像是昆蟲人和我們傳統上稱為灰人之間的混合體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. They look different.
→ {"text": "他們看起來不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. And it's not the same species.
→ {"text": "而且不是同一個物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. But they've shown up for me.
→ {"text": "但他們已經在我面前出現過了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

230. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. Do you find once you've opened yourself up to, let's say, this channeling experience back in the '90s-- was it '94 you said?
→ {"text": "你有沒有發現，一旦你向這個通靈體驗敞開自己——就是回到90年代——你說是94年嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

232. When I started, it was in '94.
→ {"text": "我開始的時候，是在94年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. And I had kind of my breakthrough in '95.
→ {"text": "然後我在95年有了突破。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

234. Do you think that has opened the door to other being experiences?
→ {"text": "你認為這打開了通往其他存有體驗的大門嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. Or do you think we're all getting these experiences and we're just not tuned into it?
→ {"text": "還是你認為我們都在經歷這些體驗，只是我們沒有調頻進去?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

236. Well, both.
→ {"text": "嗯，兩者都是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. I think we're all connected to our guides.
→ {"text": "我認為我們都與我們的指導靈連結著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. We've got two guides that are with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, who are helping us.
→ {"text": "我們有兩位指導靈每天24小時、每週7天與我們同在，在幫助我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And then we've got our solicited friends--
→ {"text": "然後我們還有我們召喚來的朋友——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

240. Everybody?
→ {"text": "每個人?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

241. Everybody.
→ {"text": "每個人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

242. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "哦，好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

243. And I laugh because people think that channeling is just something that a few people do.
→ {"text": "我會笑，因為人們以為通靈只是少數人做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. But everybody does it.
→ {"text": "但其實每個人都會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. And to me, it's like being an interpreter.
→ {"text": "對我來說，這就像是當個翻譯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. I recognize frequency and I translate it into a recognizable form, whether that's writing or whether it's speaking.
→ {"text": "我辨識頻率，然後把它轉譯成可識別的形式，不管是書寫還是口說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. But I think any form of creative expression can be a form of channeling.
→ {"text": "但我認為任何形式的創意表達都可以是一種通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. And my own experiences with beings, I think, started much younger.
→ {"text": "而我自己與存有們的體驗，我認為開始得更早。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. I think it started in childhood.
→ {"text": "我認為是從童年就開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

250. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

251. But I didn't really have an awareness, a conscious awareness of that until I started opening up in my early 20s.
→ {"text": "但我並沒有真正意識到，沒有有意識地覺察到這一點，直到我在二十歲出頭開始敞開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. And I started having some past-life experiences.
→ {"text": "然後我開始有一些前世體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. And at the time, I didn't really understand that's what was going on.
→ {"text": "當時我並不真正理解那是怎麼回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. I was accessing some of that information.
→ {"text": "我正在接取那些資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. So once I made conscious contact, then some of the things that had happened earlier in my life made a lot more sense.
→ {"text": "所以一旦我建立了有意識的接觸，那麼我生命早期發生的一些事情就變得更有意義了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. I understood, oh, that's what that was.
→ {"text": "我明白了，哦，原來那就是那回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

257. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. So you think if we all could tap into this, then this channeling experience, or our guides, humanity would be a little less hectic or frantic maybe?
→ {"text": "所以你認為如果我們都能接通這個，那麼這個通靈體驗，或者我們的指導靈，人類會不會就比較不那麼忙亂或慌張了?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

259. I think so.
→ {"text": "我覺得是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

260. Or more because now there's so much more out there that we're not aware of.
→ {"text": "還是會更多，因為現在外面有這麼多我們不知道的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. How about in your life-- I'm sure this could go on into a much deeper conversation which, hopefully, we can have later-- but quickly, by opening yourself up to this channeling experiences, has it been a positive influence in your life?
→ {"text": "那在你的生活中呢——我確信這可以延伸成一場更深入的對話，希望我們之後可以聊——但快速問一下，向這些通靈體驗敞開自己，對你的生活是正面的影響嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

262. Oh, definitely.
→ {"text": "哦，絕對是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

263. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

264. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. I can't imagine not doing it.
→ {"text": "我無法想像不做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. To me, it's normal.
→ {"text": "對我來說，這是正常的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

268. Got you.
→ {"text": "了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

269. And I always say it's going to be the new normal--
→ {"text": "而且我總是說這將會成為新常態——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

270. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

271. --because it's just expanding the connection that's already there.
→ {"text": "——因為這只是在擴展已經存在的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. We're never disconnected from anyone or anything.
→ {"text": "我們從來沒有與任何人或任何事物斷開連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. So it's just kind of opening up to what's already around us and using what's available to us, the tools.
→ {"text": "所以這只是向已經在我們周圍的東西敞開，並使用我們可以使用的工具。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. And I think the guides are going to get into it-- and I'm already hearing they are-- but part of it's understanding why we're here in 3D, the purpose of 3D, the playground.
→ {"text": "而且我認為指導靈會深入探討這個——我已經聽到他們在說了——但其中一部分是理解我們為什麼在三維空間，三維的目的，這個遊樂場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. And its opening back up to other potentials and other games that we can also participate in.
→ {"text": "以及重新敞開通往其他潛能和其他我們也可以參與的遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

276. Excellent.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. Well, with that said, can we introduce the Pleiadians?
→ {"text": "那麼，說到這裡，我們可以介紹昴宿星人了嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

278. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

279. And can we start asking some of those questions?
→ {"text": "那我們可以開始問那些問題了嗎?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

280. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

281. Excellent.
→ {"text": "太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
