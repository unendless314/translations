## Speaker Group 1

1. So I started channeling 20 years ago, it's crazy when I think that it's been 20 years.
→ {"text": "我從二十年前開始通靈，想到已經過了二十年，真的很瘋狂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. And probably about eight or nine months after I started channeling.
→ {"text": "大約在我開始通靈後八、九個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. I started getting information from this group called the Pleiadian Collective and they're 9th dimensional beings.
→ {"text": "我開始從一個叫做昴宿星集體的團體接收到訊息，他們是第九維度的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. They do not have physical form.
→ {"text": "他們沒有物質的形體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. They are beings of light and rather incarnating to a planetary body.
→ {"text": "他們是光之存有，不會投生到行星體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. They actually align with a stellar body.
→ {"text": "他們實際上是與恆星體對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. So they align with Alcyone the central sun and the Pleiades system.
→ {"text": "所以他們對齊的是昂宿六——昴宿星團的中心太陽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. And they are a little different than the other beings that I work with because I actually do work with a lot of different beings.
→ {"text": "他們和我合作的其他存有有點不同，因為我確實和很多不同的存有一起工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. I work with beings from Lyra, from Sirius, and Zetas.
→ {"text": "我與來自天琴座、天狼星、還有網罟座人的存有們一起工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Let's see,  Arcturians...so I do work with a number of beings but the Pleiadians always come through first and foremost and sometimes these other beings will show up and they may show up today and they will blend their energy with the Pleiadians.
→ {"text": "還有⋯⋯大角星人，我與許多存有一起工作，但昴宿星人總是最先出現、最主要的，有時這些其他存有也會出現——他們今天可能也會出現——並將他們的能量與昴宿星人融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. So you might notice that the energy shifts a little bit because these beings have come in and they always take point because it's somewhat easier for them to receive the... ...for you to receive the information from the Pleiadians.
→ {"text": "所以你可能會注意到能量有些微的轉變，因為這些存有進來了，而他們總是由昴宿星人帶頭，因為這樣會比較容易⋯⋯讓你們接收來自昴宿星人的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. They have such heart-based energy.
→ {"text": "他們有著如此以心為本的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. And they're also a little different because they work with tone and sound.
→ {"text": "而且他們也有點不同，因為他們透過音調與聲音工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. So that's why they're dialect is different than my own.
→ {"text": "所以這就是為什麼他們的語調和我自己的不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. It's not any one particular dialect.
→ {"text": "這不是任何一種特定的語調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. It's just tones and sounds that resonate with you at a cellular level.
→ {"text": "只是一些在細胞層次與你共鳴的音調與聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. So over the course of the next several days, they'll continue working with you and in addition to getting the information it's as if you're getting a healing as well, so you want to make sure you drink plenty of water.
→ {"text": "所以在接下來的幾天裡，他們會繼續與你們工作，而且除了獲得訊息之外，就好像你也同時在接受療癒一樣，所以記得要多喝水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. Just help move the energy through the body.
→ {"text": "幫助能量在身體中流動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. Ah yes hello dears. This is the 9th dimensional Pleiadian Collective and it is a pleasure and an honor to have the opportunity to connect with you all. because you're going through a phase right now where it is vital and in in your development that you become more and more aware of the subtle frequencies around you and as you become better able to perceive these subtle frequencies.
→ {"text": "啊，是的，親愛的們，你們好。我們是第九維度昴宿星集體，能有機會與你們所有人連結是我們的榮幸與喜悅。因為你們現在正經歷一個階段，在這個階段中，對你們的發展來說至關重要的是，你們要越來越覺察到周圍微妙的頻率，而當你們越能感知這些微妙的頻率時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. It makes life a lot easier for you because you are learning how to operate more from a state of being which will then guide you to your doing state and if you're not conscious of the subtle frequencies, you can often miss those breadcrumbs that the universe is providing you to take steps in a divinely guided way to get you on your path of higher service.
→ {"text": "這會讓你們的生活變得容易許多，因為你們正在學習如何更多地從存在的狀態運作，這將引導你們進入行動的狀態，而如果你們對微妙的頻率沒有覺知，你們常常會錯過宇宙提供給你們的那些麵包屑——那些以神聖引導的方式邁出步伐、讓你們走上更高服務之路的指引。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Also know that we are working with all of you energetically and you can connect with us at any time.
→ {"text": "同時也要知道，我們在能量上與你們所有人一起工作，你們隨時都可以與我們連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. You don't need Wendy.
→ {"text": "你們不需要溫蒂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. All you have to do is put yourself in your heart center.
→ {"text": "你們只需要將自己置於心輪中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. Think of something that makes you smile.
→ {"text": "想著某件讓你微笑的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. Ask for assistance and we will do our best to put the information in your field until you get it or you no longer want it.
→ {"text": "請求協助，我們會盡力將訊息放入你們的場域中，直到你們接收到，或者不再需要它為止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. We are helping you to elevate your frequency.
→ {"text": "我們正在協助你們提升你們的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. The one thing that we always do any time that we work with you, we work with harmonics at the very beginning, in our opening greeting and we actually do an attunement with you.
→ {"text": "有一件事是我們每次與你們工作時都會做的，就是在一開始、在我們的開場問候中運用諧波，我們實際上會與你們進行一次調頻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. We don't really talk about this a lot, but we help you to alter your vibrational field and help you to realign anything that maybe misaligned or not in in alignment with your true heart's desires.
→ {"text": "我們不常談論這件事，但我們協助你們改變你們的振動場，幫助你們重新對齊任何可能失衡的地方，或者與你們真正的內心渴望不一致的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. So your own guides are here feeding us information and what you need we will say there are no silly questions.
→ {"text": "所以你們自己的指導靈正在這裡向我們提供訊息，告訴我們你們需要什麼，我們要說的是，沒有愚蠢的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. So just know that your curiosity your fearlessness is appreciated by many.
→ {"text": "所以請知道，你們的好奇心、你們的無畏，受到許多存有的讚賞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. So we'll go ahead and dive in and see where you'd like to begin.
→ {"text": "所以我們現在就開始深入，看看你們想從哪裡開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. How may we best be of service to you today?
→ {"text": "今天我們如何能最好地為你們服務呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
