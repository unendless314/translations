174. From your time of evolution, if you can remember this or have records of this in your era, what was, in relative years-- earth years, your linear evolution from beginnings of fourth density to where you are now?
→ {"text": "從你們的演化時期來看，如果你能記得這些、或在你們那個時代有這方面的記錄，以相對年份來說——地球年份——你們從第四密度的開端到現在的線性演化，經歷了多長時間？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

175. Well, the-- our-- looking at it linearly, we went through very similar type of evolution that you are going through now, however, we would say that our challenges, as a species, were different than yours.
→ {"text": "嗯，那個——我們的——從線性角度來看，我們經歷了與你們現在正在經歷的非常相似的演化類型，然而，我們會說作為一個物種，我們的挑戰與你們的不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. So for us, a lot of our challenges had to do with self-forgiveness, guilt, things that we were holding on to as a young species that we then had to learn how to transcend.
→ {"text": "所以對我們來說，我們的許多挑戰都與自我寬恕、罪疚感有關，這些是我們作為年輕物種時緊抓不放的東西，然後我們必須學習如何超越它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. And for a very, very long period of time, those challenges for my species really stopped our evolution and almost destroyed us as a species because when you keep putting-- pushing down the emotional things that need to be explored, you can-- well, our species created a plague, so to speak.
→ {"text": "而在非常非常長的一段時間裡，這些挑戰真正地阻止了我們物種的演化，幾乎將我們作為一個物種摧毀了，因為當你持續把——把需要探索的情緒層面的東西壓抑下去時，你可以——嗯，可以說我們物種創造出了一場瘟疫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

178. A plague, oh, wow.
→ {"text": "一場瘟疫，哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

179. Plague, yes.
→ {"text": "瘟疫，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Similar to what you might call an immune plague where a disease within our immune systems was destroying us and we had no idea what it was.
→ {"text": "類似於你們可能稱之為免疫瘟疫的東西，我們免疫系統內的疾病正在摧毀我們，而我們完全不知道那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. And we had to use our connections with, you might call them the angels, or the guardians of our species, the guides of our species-- we had to connect with them to find out what it was.
→ {"text": "而我們必須運用我們與——你們可能稱他們為天使，或我們物種的守護者、我們物種的指導靈的連結——我們必須與他們連結才能找出那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. And what we found out was that our pattern, as a species, was that we were refusing to look at and integrate what you call the shadow.
→ {"text": "而我們發現的是，我們物種的模式是我們拒絕去看見並整合你們所稱的陰影。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

183. OK. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "好的。哦，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

184. So we were keeping that separation.
→ {"text": "所以我們一直維持著那種分離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. And once we could learn to integrate the shadow and the light within us, this was a significant nexus point in our fourth density evolution-- third fourth density evolution.
→ {"text": "而一旦我們能夠學會整合我們內在的陰影與光明，這就成為我們第四密度演化中的一個重要關鍵節點——第三第四密度演化。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "third fourth density evolution 可能是口誤或指涉從第三密度轉入第四密度的過渡演化"}

186. Once we were able to make that integration, then the plague healed itself and our consciousness began evolving.
→ {"text": "一旦我們能夠完成那個整合，瘟疫就自我療癒了，我們的意識也開始演化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

187. Into fourth density.
→ {"text": "進入第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

188. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

189. And was that a long time ago?
→ {"text": "那是很久以前的事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. Or time wise, in a linear sense, are you able to put a time stamp on it?
→ {"text": "或者在時間上，從線性意義來說，你能夠為它標註時間點嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

191. Oh, it's very difficult because, as you know, timelines don't line up.
→ {"text": "哦，這非常困難，因為如你所知，時間線並不對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

192. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

193. But it was long enough ago-- if we were to pinpoint a time on your world, it would have been before late, late dinosaur time.
→ {"text": "但那是相當久以前的事了——如果要在你們世界標定時間點，那會是在恐龍時代晚期之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

194. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. So we're talking thousands of years.
→ {"text": "所以我們說的是數千年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

196. Millions.
→ {"text": "數百萬年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

197. Millions of years.
→ {"text": "數百萬年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

198. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

199. In fourth density, right now, since that evolution to it.
→ {"text": "在第四密度中，現在，自從演化到那裡以來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

200. Again, the timelines don't line up.
→ {"text": "再說一次，時間線並不對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

201. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. Yeah, I understand.
→ {"text": "是的，我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

204. It's very-- it's really impossible to answer.
→ {"text": "這非常——這真的無法回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. The evolution-- generally speaking, the evolution of a physical species does take a very, very long time.
→ {"text": "演化——一般來說，物質物種的演化確實需要非常非常長的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. Now, it depends on the species.
→ {"text": "現在，這取決於物種本身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. It depends on the genetic work that's been done on the species.
→ {"text": "這取決於該物種上已經完成的基因工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. It depends on what they're holding on to, what they're willing to let go of.
→ {"text": "這取決於他們緊抓著什麼、願意放下什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. So everyone's process is different.
→ {"text": "所以每個人的過程都不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

210. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. Through these interactions, I've learned that we all create our own realities.
→ {"text": "通過這些互動，我學到我們都在創造自己的實相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. Is it possible for an individual to go into a timeline where the collective evolution of the species is accelerated, if the individual is willing to do that work, so to say.
→ {"text": "一個個體是否有可能進入一條時間線，在那裡物種的集體演化被加速了，如果該個體願意做那個工作，可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. And then-- and not bypass the collective, but go into a timeline where that collective evolution is super fast?
→ {"text": "然後——而不是繞過集體，而是進入一條該集體演化超級快速的時間線？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

214. Well, that's really the only way to change timelines.
→ {"text": "嗯，那實際上是改變時間線的唯一方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. It's not-- as you said, it's not a matter of bypassing, it's more a matter of resonance.
→ {"text": "這不是——如你所說，這不是繞過的問題，更多是共振的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

216. Right, OK.
→ {"text": "對，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

217. So we've given-- we believe you've heard it on tape, we've given a little bit of what we call the quantum map, which talks about how the reality stream or the time stream is very similar to like the blinking of eyes.
→ {"text": "所以我們已經給過——我們相信你在錄音中聽過，我們給出了一點我們稱之為量子地圖的東西，它談論實相流或時間流如何非常類似於眼睛的眨眼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. You don't notice your eyes are blinking all day.
→ {"text": "你不會注意到你的眼睛整天都在眨動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

219. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

220. But that is how the physical-- the physical universe continues to express itself is through bursts.
→ {"text": "但那就是物質——物質宇宙持續表達自己的方式，是透過爆發。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. And each time-- it's like an in breath and an out breath.
→ {"text": "而每一次——就像一次吸氣和一次呼氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. So each time there is an in breath, which is like the blinking of an eye, you realign with a new frequency structure.
→ {"text": "所以每次有一次吸氣，就像眼睛的一次眨動，你就與一個新的頻率結構重新對齊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. And that's how time-- that's how you, in a sense, jump timelines.
→ {"text": "而那就是時間——在某種意義上，那就是你如何跳躍時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. We do have to say, though, that the ego cannot direct this at all.
→ {"text": "不過我們必須說，小我完全無法主導這個過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

225. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

226. So.
→ {"text": "所以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

227. So, so it's a release of the ego in order to do that.
→ {"text": "所以，所以要做到那一點，必須釋放小我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

228. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

229. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. So it's not-- and, consciously, there's almost-- it's almost-- you can't-- almost can't do it consciously because of--
→ {"text": "所以這不是——而且，有意識地，幾乎——幾乎是——你不能——幾乎不能有意識地做到這一點，因為——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

231. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

232. --the ego is part of this conscious mental mind--
→ {"text": "——小我是這個有意識心智層面的一部分——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

233. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

234. --where we have-- where we're trying to guide, where we're trying to steer the ship.
→ {"text": "——我們有——我們試圖引導、我們試圖駕駛這艘船的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

235. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

236. And you have to sort of let go of the steering wheel to get there. >> Exactly.
→ {"text": "而你必須某種程度上放開方向盤才能到達那裡。沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. The ego has-- it has very significant needs.
→ {"text": "小我有——它有非常重要的需求。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

238. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

239. And it will always, let's say, default to those needs--
→ {"text": "而它總是會，可以說，優先回應那些需求——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

240. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

241. --before it will default to the evolution of consciousness.
→ {"text": "——而不是優先回應意識的演化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

242. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

243. Because then it dies, so to speak.
→ {"text": "因為那樣它就會死亡，可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

245. It's almost like going to the mountain and doing the hard training.
→ {"text": "這幾乎就像上山去進行艱苦的修煉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. And, then, you know, after all the hard training, you realize that, you know, to get to this enlightened state, there's no training necessary.
→ {"text": "然後，你知道，在所有艱苦的修煉之後，你意識到，你知道，要達到這個開悟的狀態，根本不需要修煉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

247. Exactly, my dear.
→ {"text": "沒錯，親愛的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

249. Excellent.
→ {"text": "太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
