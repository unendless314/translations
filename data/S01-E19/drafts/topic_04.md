174. From your time of evolution, if you can remember this or have records of this in your era, what was, in relative years-- earth years, your linear evolution from beginnings of fourth density to where you are now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

175. Well, the-- our-- looking at it linearly, we went through very similar type of evolution that you are going through now, however, we would say that our challenges, as a species, were different than yours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. So for us, a lot of our challenges had to do with self-forgiveness, guilt, things that we were holding on to as a young species that we then had to learn how to transcend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. And for a very, very long period of time, those challenges for my species really stopped our evolution and almost destroyed us as a species because when you keep putting-- pushing down the emotional things that need to be explored, you can-- well, our species created a plague, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

178. A plague, oh, wow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

179. Plague, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Similar to what you might call an immune plague where a disease within our immune systems was destroying us and we had no idea what it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. And we had to use our connections with, you might call them the angels, or the guardians of our species, the guides of our species-- we had to connect with them to find out what it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. And what we found out was that our pattern, as a species, was that we were refusing to look at and integrate what you call the shadow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

183. OK. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

184. So we were keeping that separation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. And once we could learn to integrate the shadow and the light within us, this was a significant nexus point in our fourth density evolution-- third fourth density evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. Once we were able to make that integration, then the plague healed itself and our consciousness began evolving.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

187. Into fourth density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

188. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

189. And was that a long time ago?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Or time wise, in a linear sense, are you able to put a time stamp on it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

191. Oh, it's very difficult because, as you know, timelines don't line up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

192. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

193. But it was long enough ago-- if we were to pinpoint a time on your world, it would have been before late, late dinosaur time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

194. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. So we're talking thousands of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

196. Millions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

197. Millions of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

198. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

199. In fourth density, right now, since that evolution to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

200. Again, the timelines don't line up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

201. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Yeah, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

204. It's very-- it's really impossible to answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. The evolution-- generally speaking, the evolution of a physical species does take a very, very long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. Now, it depends on the species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. It depends on the genetic work that's been done on the species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. It depends on what they're holding on to, what they're willing to let go of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. So everyone's process is different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

210. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Through these interactions, I've learned that we all create our own realities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. Is it possible for an individual to go into a timeline where the collective evolution of the species is accelerated, if the individual is willing to do that work, so to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. And then-- and not bypass the collective, but go into a timeline where that collective evolution is super fast?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

214. Well, that's really the only way to change timelines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. It's not-- as you said, it's not a matter of bypassing, it's more a matter of resonance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

216. Right, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

217. So we've given-- we believe you've heard it on tape, we've given a little bit of what we call the quantum map, which talks about how the reality stream or the time stream is very similar to like the blinking of eyes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. You don't notice your eyes are blinking all day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

219. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

220. But that is how the physical-- the physical universe continues to express itself is through bursts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. And each time-- it's like an in breath and an out breath.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. So each time there is an in breath, which is like the blinking of an eye, you realign with a new frequency structure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. And that's how time-- that's how you, in a sense, jump timelines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. We do have to say, though, that the ego cannot direct this at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

225. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

226. So.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

227. So, so it's a release of the ego in order to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

228. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

229. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. So it's not-- and, consciously, there's almost-- it's almost-- you can't-- almost can't do it consciously because of--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

231. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

232. --the ego is part of this conscious mental mind--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

233. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

234. --where we have-- where we're trying to guide, where we're trying to steer the ship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

235. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

236. And you have to sort of let go of the steering wheel to get there. >> Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. The ego has-- it has very significant needs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

238. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

239. And it will always, let's say, default to those needs--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

240. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

241. --before it will default to the evolution of consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

242. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

243. Because then it dies, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

245. It's almost like going to the mountain and doing the hard training.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. And, then, you know, after all the hard training, you realize that, you know, to get to this enlightened state, there's no training necessary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

247. Exactly, my dear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

249. Excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
