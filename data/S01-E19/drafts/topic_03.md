90. So, you know, I've heard that our plant and animal kingdom are second density consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

91. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. As we are moving into fourth density, and we're sort of in that blending of the rainbow phase, I would say early phase, where are our animals-- are they blending into the third density?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

93. Ah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. There are two ways to look at this idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. One is a linear way and one is a holographic way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

97. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

98. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. So if you are to look at it from the perspective of linearity, which is what humans are more familiar with--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

100. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

101. --then what you would see is that the other species and the other consciousness around you is moving also.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. So from the linear perspective, you're going to find that the species on your world that you might consider the higher second density species, such as the primates, and certain bird species, et cetera, they are, too, making a transition to third density, which means, then, the development of ego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. So you're starting to see even in dogs and certain animals more symptoms of ego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. Ego, of course, not meaning a negative thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Ego is simply a mechanism that grounds you in the experience of separation for a higher purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

106. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

107. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. So in that sense, then, that's the linear--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

109. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

110. --perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. Now, if you were to look at the holographic principle of this idea, we're going-- again, we have to speak in metaphors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

112. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

113. We're going to ask you to imagine seven rooms that nest inside each other like boxes-- like those Japanese boxes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. Yes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

115. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

117. And the bigger box that contains the smaller boxes would be more representative of seventh density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

118. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

119. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. So from the holographic perspective, you exist in all of those boxes, thus in all of the densities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. And it's simply a matter of perspective about the you that is choosing to notice the experience it's having at any given time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. But it is all simultaneous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. So in that sense, there's no movement, linearly--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

124. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

125. --from one density to another.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. It's a complete expression, a complete experience on all levels, simultaneously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

127. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. I saw-- would that relate to platonic solids or geometrical shapes--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

129. Exactly, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

130. --as well?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. There's a great video I just saw online-- maybe I'll post it, here, in this video-- where all of these platonic solids were inside each other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

132. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

133. And they sort of pull them apart.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

134. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. The platonic solids are a wonderful metaphor for the density energy and also for the evolution of consciousness as it moves from separation back into integration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. There is one workshop we do where we actually equate each of the densities to different platonic solids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

137. Oh, perfect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

139. It's the same idea, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

140. Oh, excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And would that mean, then, our first density minerals and, you know, rocks and these sorts of-- is water, I guess, consider a first density being?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

142. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

144. Would-- would that sort of move into the second density, then, and start having sentient consciousness?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

145. Well, the thing about first density-- again, we're-- we're challenged by the two perspectives, linear and holographic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

146. Right, I guess what I'm saying is in a linear sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

147. In a linear sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

148. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

149. In a linear sense, we have to say that the first density, consciousness, is a little bit different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

150. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

151. Because the first density consciousness, being the first manifestation into the reality of separation, is the building blocks of creation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. So it's your periodic table of the elements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

153. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

154. It's all those-- that stuff of creation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

155. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

156. Now, the higher forms, then, like high first density would be the mineral kingdom, as an example.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

157. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

159. And--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

160. Oh, OK, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. So-- >> Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

162. So just like with our-- for, like, you guys being on a higher end of the fourth density spectrum-- so you still have physical bodies like us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. The craft that you probably fly around in-- and where we're just now entering that phase, but we're still in that fourth density classification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

165. So it's a spectrum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

166. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

167. It's an entire spectrum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. But the difference you're gonna see-- because you humans are now entering the fourth density beginnings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

169. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

170. And we're toward the end.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. The biggest difference you're going to see between the two of us is what we call the egoic anchor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

172. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

173. So ours is not as heavy, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
