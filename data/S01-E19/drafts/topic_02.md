## Speaker Group 7

27. First, I'd like to sort of ask... ...what density do you reside in?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

28. We are within what you would call the higher levels of fourth density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

29. Oh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

30. So we still have physical bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

31. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

32. But we know that our planet and our people is making-- on our way to making the transition to no longer having bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

33. So-- so almost-- well, fifth-- my understanding-- and I could be wrong-- but fifth-- fifth, sixth density would be more losing the body sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. But on the fourth density as well?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

35. In the scale that we use, which is seven densities--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

36. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

37. --the fourth density is the last density in which physicality is expressed as a separate body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

38. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

39. As you begin moving into fifth density, then you become more plasmic in nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

40. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

41. So you could kind of say light beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

42. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

43. But as you go farther and farther, deeper and deeper into fifth density, then it becomes less individualized and you start moving more toward collective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

44. Would-- are dream states be a fifth density reality?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. What density would you classify the dreams in?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

46. Well, this is a metaphor that we've used in the past for another project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. We're going to resurrect it here because it's very useful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

48. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

49. If you consider the idea of a golden lake to be your state of oneness in complete integration, the state of sleep is the time when, in a sense, you revisit, or reconnect, with that state of oneness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. So we wouldn't say that it is necessarily a separate density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. The dream state is another expression of consciousness as you are reconnecting with your true nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

52. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. So it's not even-- it's almost in its own classification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

54. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

55. Sort of like angelic realms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. Well, angelic realms I've heard are borderline somewhere around seventh-- sixth, seventh, eighth density sort of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. But is that-- do they have a classification?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

58. Well, based on what you're saying, it seems we're using different scales.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

59. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. Yes. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

61. So obviously, the answers are going to be a little bit confusing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. For us, it's a seven density scale.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

63. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

64. So we consider the angelic realm to be more sixth density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

65. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. This is good because I-- you know, having, again, this scale or base to ask questions from and sort of go back and forth, it helps the audience sort of put the pieces of the puzzle together, formulate their own ideas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

68. Yes. >> Because a lot of the same-- sometimes, we use same terminologies, but, like we just noticed, that it might be just slightly a little bit different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

69. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. If we will-- if we can say just a little bit more about density, just to give a broader perspective--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

71. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

72. --for those who are listening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. The best way to describe our version of the communications about density is to liken it to the idea of a rainbow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. So when you have the original white light that then passes through a prism and becomes a rainbow, those seven light frequencies that you see are kind of representative of the idea of the densities of consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. But if you look at them very closely, a rainbow for instance--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

76. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

77. --there's not a sharp division between each one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

78. Right. >> There's a gradation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

79. Correct, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

80. So consciousness, thus, moves from its original state of oneness through the fragmentation and through series of different types of expression.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. The densest being third density, which is where humanity is leaving from, because it's egoic based.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

82. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

83. And then, you begin moving out of that ego-based reality and back into the collective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

84. I've also-- wonderful analogy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. I've also-- most of the analogies I've heard it's sort of related to the chakra system, which, again, is related to the rainbow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. So it's--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

87. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

88. It sort of goes full circle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

89. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
