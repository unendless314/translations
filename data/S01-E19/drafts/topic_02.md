## Speaker Group 7

27. First, I'd like to sort of ask... ...what density do you reside in?
→ {"text": "首先，我想問一下……你處於哪個密度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

28. We are within what you would call the higher levels of fourth density.
→ {"text": "我們處於你們所說的第四密度的較高層級。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

29. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

30. So we still have physical bodies.
→ {"text": "所以你們仍然有物質身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

31. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

32. But we know that our planet and our people is making-- on our way to making the transition to no longer having bodies.
→ {"text": "但我們知道，我們的星球和我們的族人正在進行——正在朝著不再擁有肉身的轉變邁進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

33. So-- so almost-- well, fifth-- my understanding-- and I could be wrong-- but fifth-- fifth, sixth density would be more losing the body sense.
→ {"text": "所以——所以幾乎——嗯，第五——我的理解——我可能是錯的——但第五、第五、第六密度會更多地失去肉身感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. But on the fourth density as well?
→ {"text": "但第四密度也是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

35. In the scale that we use, which is seven densities--
→ {"text": "在我們使用的量表中，也就是七密度量表——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

36. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

37. --the fourth density is the last density in which physicality is expressed as a separate body.
→ {"text": "——第四密度是最後一個以獨立肉身表達物質性的密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

38. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

39. As you begin moving into fifth density, then you become more plasmic in nature.
→ {"text": "當你開始進入第五密度時，你在本質上會變得更加電漿態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

40. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

41. So you could kind of say light beings.
→ {"text": "所以你可以說是光之存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

42. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

43. But as you go farther and farther, deeper and deeper into fifth density, then it becomes less individualized and you start moving more toward collective.
→ {"text": "但當你越走越遠，越來越深入第五密度時，個體性就會變得越來越弱，你開始朝向集體移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

44. Would-- are dream states be a fifth density reality?
→ {"text": "那麼——夢境狀態是第五密度實相嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. What density would you classify the dreams in?
→ {"text": "你會把夢境歸類在哪個密度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

46. Well, this is a metaphor that we've used in the past for another project.
→ {"text": "嗯，這是我們過去在另一個項目中使用過的比喻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. We're going to resurrect it here because it's very useful.
→ {"text": "我們要在這裡重新使用它，因為它非常有用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

48. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

49. If you consider the idea of a golden lake to be your state of oneness in complete integration, the state of sleep is the time when, in a sense, you revisit, or reconnect, with that state of oneness.
→ {"text": "如果你把金色湖泊的概念視為你在完全整合中的合一狀態，那麼睡眠狀態就是你在某種意義上重訪或重新連結那個合一狀態的時刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. So we wouldn't say that it is necessarily a separate density.
→ {"text": "所以我們不會說它必然是一個獨立的密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. The dream state is another expression of consciousness as you are reconnecting with your true nature.
→ {"text": "夢境狀態是意識的另一種表達，當你重新連結你的真實本質時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

52. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. So it's not even-- it's almost in its own classification.
→ {"text": "所以它甚至不是——它幾乎是在自己的分類中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

54. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

55. Sort of like angelic realms.
→ {"text": "有點像天使界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. Well, angelic realms I've heard are borderline somewhere around seventh-- sixth, seventh, eighth density sort of thing.
→ {"text": "嗯，我聽說天使界的邊界大約在第七——第六、第七、第八密度之類的地方。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文提到 seventh, sixth, seventh, eighth，語序稍顯混亂，保留原意"}

57. But is that-- do they have a classification?
→ {"text": "但那是——他們有分類嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

58. Well, based on what you're saying, it seems we're using different scales.
→ {"text": "嗯，根據你所說的，看來我們使用的是不同的量表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

59. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. Yes. OK.
→ {"text": "是的。好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

61. So obviously, the answers are going to be a little bit confusing.
→ {"text": "所以顯然，答案會有點令人困惑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. For us, it's a seven density scale.
→ {"text": "對我們來說，這是一個七密度量表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

63. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

64. So we consider the angelic realm to be more sixth density.
→ {"text": "所以我們認為天使界更接近第六密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

65. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. All right.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. This is good because I-- you know, having, again, this scale or base to ask questions from and sort of go back and forth, it helps the audience sort of put the pieces of the puzzle together, formulate their own ideas.
→ {"text": "這很好，因為我——你知道，再次擁有這個量表或基礎來提問，然後來回討論，這有助於觀眾把拼圖的碎片拼湊起來，形成他們自己的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

68. Yes. >> Because a lot of the same-- sometimes, we use same terminologies, but, like we just noticed, that it might be just slightly a little bit different.
→ {"text": "是的。因為很多相同的——有時候，我們使用相同的術語，但就像我們剛才注意到的，它可能只是稍微有一點不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

69. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. If we will-- if we can say just a little bit more about density, just to give a broader perspective--
→ {"text": "如果我們可以——如果我們能再多說一點關於密度的內容，只是為了提供更廣闊的視角——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

71. Yes.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

72. --for those who are listening.
→ {"text": "——給那些正在聆聽的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. The best way to describe our version of the communications about density is to liken it to the idea of a rainbow.
→ {"text": "描述我們關於密度的溝通版本的最好方式，就是把它比喻成彩虹的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. So when you have the original white light that then passes through a prism and becomes a rainbow, those seven light frequencies that you see are kind of representative of the idea of the densities of consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以當你有原始的白光，然後它通過稜鏡變成彩虹，你看到的那七種光頻率，某種程度上代表了意識密度的概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. But if you look at them very closely, a rainbow for instance--
→ {"text": "但如果你非常仔細地觀察它們，比如彩虹——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

76. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

77. --there's not a sharp division between each one.
→ {"text": "——它們之間沒有明確的分界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

78. Right. >> There's a gradation.
→ {"text": "對。有一個漸變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

79. Correct, yeah.
→ {"text": "沒錯，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

80. So consciousness, thus, moves from its original state of oneness through the fragmentation and through series of different types of expression.
→ {"text": "因此，意識從它原始的合一狀態，透過碎裂化，經歷一系列不同類型的表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. The densest being third density, which is where humanity is leaving from, because it's egoic based.
→ {"text": "最密集的是第三密度，這是人類正在離開的地方，因為它是以小我為基礎的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

82. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

83. And then, you begin moving out of that ego-based reality and back into the collective.
→ {"text": "然後，你開始從那個以小我為基礎的實相中移出，回到集體之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

84. I've also-- wonderful analogy.
→ {"text": "我也——很棒的比喻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. I've also-- most of the analogies I've heard it's sort of related to the chakra system, which, again, is related to the rainbow.
→ {"text": "我也——我聽到的大多數比喻都與脈輪系統有關，而脈輪系統又與彩虹有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. So it's--
→ {"text": "所以它——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

87. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

88. It sort of goes full circle.
→ {"text": "它算是兜了一個完整的圈子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

89. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
