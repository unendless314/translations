585. Now I've heard different stories on the Zeta race is, I've heard in one scenario that the Zeta's have died off, that they, you know, they created the hybrid races, they couldn't continue to reproduce so they eventually died off.
→ {"text": "現在我聽到關於網罟座灰人種族有不同的說法，我聽過一種情境是網罟座灰人已經滅絕了，他們創造了混種族群，但他們自己無法繼續繁殖，所以最終滅絕了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. And I've heard other stories now that the Zetas are continuing their evolution because of their interaction with humans, they've actually activated their emotional bodies and are thriving quite well.
→ {"text": "而我也聽到另一種說法是，網罟座灰人因為與人類的互動，正在繼續演化，他們實際上啟動了他們的情緒體，並且發展得相當好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. And I don't know if they're back to reproducing, but at least they're on that path.
→ {"text": "我不知道他們是否恢復了繁殖能力，但至少他們在那條道路上了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. And I'm assuming there's two different timelines that these are happening?
→ {"text": "而我猜想這是發生在兩條不同的時間線上？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. How does this work?
→ {"text": "這是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. Well, as with any species, if there is an aspect of the species that refuses to change, that portion of it will die off.
→ {"text": "嗯，就像任何物種一樣，如果物種的某個面向拒絕改變，那麼那部分就會滅亡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 351

591. Okay.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 352

592. Alright?
→ {"text": "對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. But, as we were talking about before, regarding the three eras of most of the physical species that you're connected with, the Zetas also have their three eras.
→ {"text": "但就像我們之前談到的，大多數與你們連結的物質物種都會經歷三個時代，網罟座灰人也有他們的三個時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. So the first era was the era of their species crisis, and when they weren't able to reproduce and the emotional body was cut off etc.
→ {"text": "所以第一個時代是他們的物種危機時代，當時他們無法繁殖，情緒體被切斷了，諸如此類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. The second era started to take place as the interactions with humans began, and all through the interaction period, for their species, it meant the reintegration with the emotional body through the work with humans.
→ {"text": "第二個時代開始於他們與人類的互動展開之時，在整個互動期間，對他們的物種而言，這意味著透過與人類的合作，重新整合情緒體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. But also through the creation of the hybrid species because... And you know the whole story, the drama about learning to nurture them and things such as that.
→ {"text": "但也透過創造混種族群，因為……你知道整個故事，關於學習如何養育他們之類的種種過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 353

597. Right, yes.
→ {"text": "對，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 354

598. And all of those challenges they had in the second era helped their integration process.
→ {"text": "而他們在第二個時代遇到的所有挑戰，都幫助了他們的整合過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. Then the third era Zeta, we would call the awakened ones.
→ {"text": "接下來第三個時代的網罟座灰人，我們會稱之為覺醒者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. Mmm hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. So this is a very, very high level Zeta consciousness that... then talking about parallel timelines, in the 80's and the 90's, very few people on Earth were tapping into that third level Zeta consciousness, because people were still processing the more polarized victim consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以這是一種非常、非常高階的網罟座灰人意識……然後談到平行時間線，在 1980 與 1990 年代，地球上很少有人能連結到那第三層級的網罟座灰人意識，因為人們當時仍在處理更極化的受害者意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 355

602. Correct.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 356

603. But we would say really beginning five to ten years ago on Earth, your... many of you are now starting to tap into the third era Zeta consciousness when they have awakened.
→ {"text": "但我們會說，真正從地球上大約五到十年前開始，你們……你們許多人現在開始連結到第三時代的網罟座灰人意識，當他們已經覺醒的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. So their emotional bodies, mental bodies, all of that, came into alignment and integration.  And they've become like an elder race that is very... acting very much as mentors for younger species now....
→ {"text": "所以他們的情緒體、心智體，所有這些，都進入了校準與整合。而他們已經成為了一個長者種族，非常……現在非常像是年輕物種的導師……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. Wow, how does that all work?
→ {"text": "哇，這一切是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. I guess, to put it in a, in a linear... And again,  this is our linear minds trying to figure this out, because we have very advanced future versions of the Essassani and Bashar coming in and talking to us; the Yahyel, we have other channelers bringing in different beings from the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "我想，用線性的方式來說……而且這又是我們的線性心智試圖理解這件事，因為我們有非常先進的未來版本的艾莎莎尼和巴夏前來與我們對話；亞耶爾，我們也有其他通靈者帶來來自亞耶爾文明的不同存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. And I'm assuming that they look up to the Zeta, that third tier of the Zetas that we were just talking about. >>Yes.
→ {"text": "而我猜想他們敬仰網罟座灰人，我們剛才說的第三層級的網罟座灰人。是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 357

608. That they're interacting with them on that level. >>Yes, like grandfathers. >>Right grandfathers, because I'm sure their vibrational frequency is at that higher level, so they're ... in their reality, in their timeline, they still exist.
→ {"text": "他們在那個層級與他們互動。是的，就像祖父一樣。對，祖父，因為我確信他們的振動頻率在那個更高的層級，所以他們……在他們的實相中，在他們的時間線中，他們依然存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

609. Yes.  They didn't die off.  >>Yes.  >>And yet we're humans in this level and, you know we're... how does that interaction... I don't know...
→ {"text": "是的。他們並沒有滅絕。是的。然而我們是在這個層級的人類，而且，你知道我們……這種互動是如何……我不知道……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. Could you go into depth a little bit about that?
→ {"text": "你能稍微深入談一下這個嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 358

611. My goodness, we're not sure exactly, because there's so many tangents we could go off at.
→ {"text": "天啊，我們不太確定具體怎麼說，因為有太多可以延伸的方向了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

612. Is there a specific curiosity and we can start there?
→ {"text": "有沒有特定的好奇點，我們可以從那裡開始？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 359

613. I... The... It's... It has to do with time and the sense that we have these different aspects of the Yahyel and the Essassani, and even the Zetas, coming back at this particular time, that version of them.  Why not...
→ {"text": "我……這個……這……這跟時間有關，以及我們有這些亞耶爾、艾莎莎尼，甚至網罟座灰人的不同面向，在這個特定時刻回來，那個版本的他們。為什麼不是……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. And even the version of yourself, why not an earlier version of, of the Pleiadean...
→ {"text": "甚至包括你自己的版本，為什麼不是更早期的昴宿星人版本……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 360

615. Ah, all right.  >>And then we, and then we have higher density, dimensional collectives of the Pleiadians also visiting us.
→ {"text": "啊，好的。然後我們，然後我們也有更高密度、維度集體的昴宿星人來拜訪我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 361

616. Yes, well, it's back to what we were talking about earlier regarding frequency compatibility.  >>Okay.  >>And also what you're calling in to push you to move to another level.
→ {"text": "是的，嗯，這又回到我們之前談到的關於頻率相容性的問題。好的。還有你們呼喚什麼來推動你們進入另一個層級。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 362

617. Okay, I see.  >>So you have, you have one aspect that is the challenge aspect that pushes you, and you have another aspect that is more of a mentorship level.  >>I see.
→ {"text": "好，我明白了。所以你們有一個面向是挑戰面向，推動你們前進，而你們也有另一個面向更像是導師層級。我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 363

618. Okay, so for instance, you on your world, you have some UFO lore, if you wish to call it that, from the 60's or 70's - the Billy Meier Pleiadian contacts?  >>Oh yes, yeah. >>Alright, and so sometimes people ask "Sasha, do you know Semjase?" Okay.  Well from my perspective, my time, she is a past figure.  >>Okay.  >>Long, long gone.  >>Right.  >>Not in physical body any more, but in your time stream in the 70's you were pulling
→ {"text": "好，所以舉例來說，你們在你們的世界上，有一些不明飛行物傳說，如果你想這麼稱呼的話，來自 1960 或 1970 年代——比利·麥爾的昴宿星接觸？哦是的，對。好的，所以有時人們會問「莎夏，你認識瑟姆雅榭嗎？」好。嗯，從我的視角、我的時間來看，她是一個過去的人物。好的。很久很久以前的了。對。已經不再擁有物質身體了，但在你們 1970 年代的時間流中，你們正在拉入", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. in those Pleiadian contacts because that's what you needed.
→ {"text": "那些昴宿星接觸，因為那是你們需要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 364

620. I see.  >>Now you're pulling in different types of Pleiadian contacts because that's what you need as well .  So the Essassani, the Essassani especially, and the hybrid species are playing a very important role that has to do with alchemy.  What do we mean by that?  Well the idea of alchemy is the bringing together of two seemingly conflicting ideas that create a response when they come
→ {"text": "我明白了。現在你們正在拉入不同類型的昴宿星接觸，因為那也是你們需要的。所以艾莎莎尼，特別是艾莎莎尼，還有混種族群，正在扮演一個非常重要的角色，這與煉金術有關。我們這是什麼意思呢？嗯，煉金術的概念是將兩個看似衝突的想法結合在一起，當它們相遇時創造出一種回應", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. together to create a third idea.  >>Right.
→ {"text": "以創造出第三個想法。對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 365

622. And this is, let's say, energy dynamics 101 in terms of species evolution.  So whenever you get to a planet that is moving from 3rd to 4th density, they are going to have to integrate the mental and emotional bodies, and they do so through a form of alchemy.  So the Essassani, in a sense, are the alchemists or the representations of successful alchemy.  >>Okay.  >>And you see it at a... through
→ {"text": "而這可以說是物種演化方面的能量動力學 101 課程。所以每當你遇到一個正在從第三密度移向第四密度的星球，他們將必須整合心智體與情緒體，而他們透過某種形式的煉金術來做到這一點。所以艾莎莎尼，在某種意義上，是煉金術士，或是成功煉金術的代表。好的。而你看到這在一種……透過", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. the combination of Zeta and human, but also through what they actually integrated, which is the mental and emotional bodies.  >>I've heard Bashar speak that the Essassani are closely related to the Sirius energy.
→ {"text": "網罟座灰人與人類的結合，但也透過他們實際整合的東西，也就是心智體與情緒體。我聽過巴夏說艾莎莎尼與天狼星能量密切相關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 366

624. Yes. ...in terms of Bashar, you will find that the flow of energy for the Essassani evolution moves toward a higher non-physical Sirian vibration for its future selves.  So you find that a lot of... there's a lot of future incarnations that move from the Essassani to the Sirian.
→ {"text": "是的。……就巴夏而言，你會發現艾莎莎尼演化的能量流動，為其未來的自己，朝向更高的非物質天狼星頻率移動。所以你會發現很多……有很多未來化身從艾莎莎尼移向天狼星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

625. And we would call that third era Sirian beings, again, the awakened ones.  >>I see.  And humanity, it seems like we're in a crossroads right now, because we have so many directions we can go with our evolution.
→ {"text": "而我們會稱那為第三時代的天狼星存有，再次強調，是覺醒者。我明白了。而人類，似乎我們現在正處於一個十字路口，因為我們的演化有很多方向可以走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 367

626. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 368

627. We can go towards the Sirian direction of evolution; we can go towards the Pleiadian direction; we can even go towards the Draconian... >>Yes  >>...way of evolution, and in specific time lines we are doing it all simultaneously.  >>Exactly, yes.
→ {"text": "我們可以朝向天狼星方向的演化；我們可以朝向昴宿星方向；我們甚至可以朝向天龍座……是的……演化的方式，而在特定的時間線中，我們同時在做所有這些。完全正確，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 369

628. Okay.  And its really up to us individually to see which one we want to be a part of.
→ {"text": "好的。而這真的取決於我們個人，看我們想要成為哪一個的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 370

629. So we go back then to what we were talking about a few moments ago, about...
→ {"text": "所以我們回到剛才談論的話題，關於……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. Because the ego cannot control the trajectory, all you have is the current moment.  So in the current moment your trajectory becomes clear.
→ {"text": "因為小我無法控制軌跡，你所擁有的只有當下這一刻。所以在當下這一刻，你的軌跡變得清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. So this is some work Lyssa, Germane and myself have been doing with those, with using the Galactic cards to help bring the focus with people to what is happening for them in this moment now?
→ {"text": "所以這是 Lyssa、Germane 和我自己一直在做的一些工作，使用銀河卡片來幫助人們將焦點帶到此刻正在為他們發生的事情上？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Lyssa 與 Germane 保留英文，應為人名或實體名稱；Galactic cards 譯為「銀河卡片」"}

632. And lets say it's an emotional pattern that's more anchored in past Pleiadian, or an emotional pattern that's more anchored in past Zeta, then these become icons almost or, or archetypal stories that can help you move through in this moment now whatever your challenge is, and it ripples through time in both directions.  Because ultimately...
→ {"text": "而比方說，如果那是一個更錨定於過去昴宿星人的情緒模式，或一個更錨定於過去網罟座灰人的情緒模式，那麼這些幾乎就成為圖標，或者說，原型故事，可以幫助你在此刻穿越你的任何挑戰，並且它會向兩個方向在時間中漣漪擴散。因為最終……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

633. Again, going back to the seven rooms, seven concentric circles, you are the one and your fragments are inside the one, so you're never really outside of anything and everything is you anyway.
→ {"text": "再次，回到七個房間、七個同心圓的概念，你就是那個一，而你的碎片都在那個一之內，所以你從來不真正處於任何事物之外，而一切無論如何都是你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
