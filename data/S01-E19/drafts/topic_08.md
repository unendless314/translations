585. Now I've heard different stories on the Zeta race is, I've heard in one scenario that the Zeta's have died off, that they, you know, they created the hybrid races, they couldn't continue to reproduce so they eventually died off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. And I've heard other stories now that the Zetas are continuing their evolution because of their interaction with humans, they've actually activated their emotional bodies and are thriving quite well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. And I don't know if they're back to reproducing, but at least they're on that path.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. And I'm assuming there's two different timelines that these are happening?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. How does this work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. Well, as with any species, if there is an aspect of the species that refuses to change, that portion of it will die off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 351

591. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 352

592. Alright?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. But, as we were talking about before, regarding the three eras of most of the physical species that you're connected with, the Zetas also have their three eras.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. So the first era was the era of their species crisis, and when they weren't able to reproduce and the emotional body was cut off etc.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. The second era started to take place as the interactions with humans began, and all through the interaction period, for their species, it meant the reintegration with the emotional body through the work with humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. But also through the creation of the hybrid species because... And you know the whole story, the drama about learning to nurture them and things such as that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 353

597. Right, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 354

598. And all of those challenges they had in the second era helped their integration process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. Then the third era Zeta, we would call the awakened ones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. Mmm hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. So this is a very, very high level Zeta consciousness that... then talking about parallel timelines, in the 80's and the 90's, very few people on Earth were tapping into that third level Zeta consciousness, because people were still processing the more polarized victim consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 355

602. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 356

603. But we would say really beginning five to ten years ago on Earth, your... many of you are now starting to tap into the third era Zeta consciousness when they have awakened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. So their emotional bodies, mental bodies, all of that, came into alignment and integration.  And they've become like an elder race that is very... acting very much as mentors for younger species now....
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. Wow, how does that all work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. I guess, to put it in a, in a linear... And again,  this is our linear minds trying to figure this out, because we have very advanced future versions of the Essassani and Bashar coming in and talking to us; the Yahyel, we have other channelers bringing in different beings from the Yahyel civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. And I'm assuming that they look up to the Zeta, that third tier of the Zetas that we were just talking about. >>Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 357

608. That they're interacting with them on that level. >>Yes, like grandfathers. >>Right grandfathers, because I'm sure their vibrational frequency is at that higher level, so they're ... in their reality, in their timeline, they still exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. Yes.  They didn't die off.  >>Yes.  >>And yet we're humans in this level and, you know we're... how does that interaction... I don't know...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. Could you go into depth a little bit about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 358

611. My goodness, we're not sure exactly, because there's so many tangents we could go off at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. Is there a specific curiosity and we can start there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 359

613. I... The... It's... It has to do with time and the sense that we have these different aspects of the Yahyel and the Essassani, and even the Zetas, coming back at this particular time, that version of them.  Why not...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. And even the version of yourself, why not an earlier version of, of the Pleiadean...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 360

615. Ah, all right.  >>And then we, and then we have higher density, dimensional collectives of the Pleiadians also visiting us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 361

616. Yes, well, it's back to what we were talking about earlier regarding frequency compatibility.  >>Okay.  >>And also what you're calling in to push you to move to another level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 362

617. Okay, I see.  >>So you have, you have one aspect that is the challenge aspect that pushes you, and you have another aspect that is more of a mentorship level.  >>I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 363

618. Okay, so for instance, you on your world, you have some UFO lore, if you wish to call it that, from the 60's or 70's - the Billy Meier Pleiadian contacts?  >>Oh yes, yeah. >>Alright, and so sometimes people ask "Sasha, do you know Semjase?" Okay.  Well from my perspective, my time, she is a past figure.  >>Okay.  >>Long, long gone.  >>Right.  >>Not in physical body any more, but in your time stream in the 70's you were pulling
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. in those Pleiadian contacts because that's what you needed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 364

620. I see.  >>Now you're pulling in different types of Pleiadian contacts because that's what you need as well .  So the Essassani, the Essassani especially, and the hybrid species are playing a very important role that has to do with alchemy.  What do we mean by that?  Well the idea of alchemy is the bringing together of two seemingly conflicting ideas that create a response when they come
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. together to create a third idea.  >>Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 365

622. And this is, let's say, energy dynamics 101 in terms of species evolution.  So whenever you get to a planet that is moving from 3rd to 4th density, they are going to have to integrate the mental and emotional bodies, and they do so through a form of alchemy.  So the Essassani, in a sense, are the alchemists or the representations of successful alchemy.  >>Okay.  >>And you see it at a... through
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. the combination of Zeta and human, but also through what they actually integrated, which is the mental and emotional bodies.  >>I've heard Bashar speak that the Essassani are closely related to the Sirius energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 366

624. Yes. ...in terms of Bashar, you will find that the flow of energy for the Essassani evolution moves toward a higher non-physical Sirian vibration for its future selves.  So you find that a lot of... there's a lot of future incarnations that move from the Essassani to the Sirian.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. And we would call that third era Sirian beings, again, the awakened ones.  >>I see.  And humanity, it seems like we're in a crossroads right now, because we have so many directions we can go with our evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 367

626. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 368

627. We can go towards the Sirian direction of evolution; we can go towards the Pleiadian direction; we can even go towards the Draconian... >>Yes  >>...way of evolution, and in specific time lines we are doing it all simultaneously.  >>Exactly, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 369

628. Okay.  And its really up to us individually to see which one we want to be a part of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 370

629. So we go back then to what we were talking about a few moments ago, about...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. Because the ego cannot control the trajectory, all you have is the current moment.  So in the current moment your trajectory becomes clear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. So this is some work Lyssa, Germane and myself have been doing with those, with using the Galactic cards to help bring the focus with people to what is happening for them in this moment now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. And lets say it's an emotional pattern that's more anchored in past Pleiadian, or an emotional pattern that's more anchored in past Zeta, then these become icons almost or, or archetypal stories that can help you move through in this moment now whatever your challenge is, and it ripples through time in both directions.  Because ultimately...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. Again, going back to the seven rooms, seven concentric circles, you are the one and your fragments are inside the one, so you're never really outside of anything and everything is you anyway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
