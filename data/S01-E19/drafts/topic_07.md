492. Exactly. we're having this conversation with Lisa and Ron, earlier, about the-- we call it the Mandela Effect, is the internet terminology for what seems to be, from one perspective, a shifting of timelines.
→ {"text": "沒錯。我們稍早和 Lisa 與 Ron 聊到這個話題——我們稱之為曼德拉效應，這是網路上對於某種現象的稱呼，從一個視角來看，似乎是時間線在轉換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

493. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

494. And it's almost now been labeled.
→ {"text": "而且現在它幾乎被貼上了標籤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. Now, we have a collective name for it.

## Speaker Group 295

497. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

498. And we're going back and reviewing movies and tangible, physical things, that the way we remembered them, they weren't that way before.
→ {"text": "而且我們回頭去檢視電影和其他實質、物質的東西，我們記得的樣子，它們以前並不是那樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 299

501. It is the you-- as we were just talking about a moment ago, time is more fluid.

→ {"text": "當你扎根於——可以這麼說——第三密度時，時間感覺起來、也被感知為更加固定的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. But now you're moving more into a fluid sense of time.

505. And that means, then, that you are-- again, it's a metaphor.

506. It's the limit of the language.
→ {"text": "這是語言的限制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

## Speaker Group 303

508. You are spending more time in the quantum state of consciousness where all possibilities exist.
→ {"text": "你們正花更多時間處在意識的量子狀態中，在那裡所有可能性都存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

509. Right.

## Speaker Group 307

512. You are able to shift the timelines much more rapidly.

513. But in the past when you did it, you didn't remember the previous one.
→ {"text": "但在過去當你們這麼做時，你們不記得之前那條時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. But now, as you are spending more time in the quantum, you're becoming more familiar and comfortable with that energy, that you're starting to remember the other parallels.
→ {"text": "但現在，由於你們花更多時間處在量子狀態中，你們對那種能量變得更加熟悉和自在，你們開始記得其他平行時間線了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. Not in a schizophrenic way, but in a way that's meant to just tell-- that's meant to just show you--
→ {"text": "不是以精神分裂的方式，而是以一種意在告訴你們——意在向你們展示——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

517. --look how fluid you are becoming, you are unlocking.
→ {"text": "——看你們變得多麼流動，你們正在解鎖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

518. And that's where the excitement-- you know, this is-- >> Yes.
→ {"text": "而這就是令人興奮之處——你知道，這是——是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. So now, you're beginning to see that the future-- you've always seen the future as fluid, but now, you're seeing the past as fluid, too.
→ {"text": "所以現在，你們開始看到未來——你們一直把未來視為流動的，但現在，你們也看到過去同樣是流動的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

520. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. And-- and we can rewrite the story if we want to.

## Speaker Group 317

528. Ah, yes.
→ {"text": "啊，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 318

532. I can absolutely see that.
→ {"text": "我完全看得出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. So we want to rewrite the story, but we can't really rewrite the story.

## Speaker Group 323

→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

543. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. So the only thing, then, that you have in the now is your experience of the now.
→ {"text": "所以，在當下你們唯一擁有的，就是你們對當下的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

545. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

546. So therefore, what you are really rewriting is your experience of the now--
→ {"text": "因此，你們真正在改寫的，是你們對當下的體驗——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

547. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "——而這真正關乎的，是你們對當下的詮釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

549. And that, depending on that interpretation, will set us on a specific vibrational frequency.
→ {"text": "而根據那個詮釋，會將我們設定在特定的振動頻率上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

550. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

551. And then, depending on that vibrational frequency, we see the past rewrite itself.
→ {"text": "然後，根據那個振動頻率，我們就會看到過去改寫它自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

552. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. So if your interpretation of the now is one of victimization--
→ {"text": "所以如果你對當下的詮釋是一種受害——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

554. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 336

557. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

558. And if you are at a vibrational frequency of non-victimization, empowerment, then, you're going to be going on the ships and donating your stuff instead of actually being taken against your will.
→ {"text": "而如果你處在非受害、賦權的振動頻率，那麼，你就會登上飛船並捐贈你的東西，而不是真的被違背意願地帶走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

559. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. And even-- getting out-- getting out of the ET stuff-- even we're talking about, is your boss picking on you at work?
→ {"text": "而且甚至——跳脫出——跳脫出外星人的話題——我們甚至在談論，你的老闆在工作時找你麻煩嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

561. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "所以我們甚至在談論人類層面的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

563. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. And then, shifting that perspective, shifting that now moment, now all of a sudden your boss is not picking on you, but got a greater plan or, you know, something, some other story.
→ {"text": "然後，轉換那個視角，轉換那個當下時刻，現在突然之間你的老闆不是在找你麻煩，而是有個更大的計畫，或者，你知道，某種其他的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

566. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

567. And this brings in the whole other aspect of the emotional body because the ego, the insidious ego-- we say that with love because the ego is simply a neutral mechanism.
→ {"text": "而這帶入了情緒體的整個另一面向，因為小我，陰險的小我——我們帶著愛這麼說，因為小我只是個中性的機制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. But the insidious ego will continue its dialogue with you that will tell you, well, if you're not shifting this now, you're not very spiritual.
→ {"text": "但陰險的小我會繼續與你對話，告訴你，好吧，如果你現在沒有轉換這個，你就不夠靈性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. You're bad.
→ {"text": "你很糟糕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. You're failing.
→ {"text": "你失敗了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. And that that just further entrenches--
→ {"text": "而這只會進一步鞏固——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

572. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 344

573. --the anchor of the ego.
→ {"text": "——小我的錨點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 345

574. So it's just a big lesson of allowance and acceptance.
→ {"text": "所以這只是個關於允許和接納的大課題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 346

575. Exactly.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. Exactly.

578. And not the knee jerk reactions.

581. And that's the key to your freedom.
