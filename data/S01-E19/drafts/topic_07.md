## Speaker Group 292

492. Exactly. we're having this conversation with Lisa and Ron, earlier, about the-- we call it the Mandela Effect, is the internet terminology for what seems to be, from one perspective, a shifting of timelines.

## Speaker Group 293

493. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

494. And it's almost now been labeled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Now, we have a collective name for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. And we're seeing pieces in our history shifting from the way we remember it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

497. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

498. And we're going back and reviewing movies and tangible, physical things, that the way we remembered them, they weren't that way before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

499. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

500. Is this the actual shifting of timelines?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

501. It is the you-- as we were just talking about a moment ago, time is more fluid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

502. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

503. When you are rooted, let's say, in third density, time feels and is perceived as being more fixed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. But now you're moving more into a fluid sense of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. And that means, then, that you are-- again, it's a metaphor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. It's the limit of the language.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

507. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

508. You are spending more time in the quantum state of consciousness where all possibilities exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

509. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

510. And you are, thus, able to-- remember, we were talking about the blinking in and out, or the in and out breath.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

511. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

512. You are able to shift the timelines much more rapidly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. But in the past when you did it, you didn't remember the previous one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. But now, as you are spending more time in the quantum, you're becoming more familiar and comfortable with that energy, that you're starting to remember the other parallels.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. Not in a schizophrenic way, but in a way that's meant to just tell-- that's meant to just show you--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

516. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

517. --look how fluid you are becoming, you are unlocking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

518. And that's where the excitement-- you know, this is-- >> Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. So now, you're beginning to see that the future-- you've always seen the future as fluid, but now, you're seeing the past as fluid, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

520. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. And-- and we can rewrite the story if we want to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 312

522. Yes, but the ego can never rewrite anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

523. Ah, the ego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

525. Yes, yes, ah, the ego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 315

526. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

527. This is where people who do manifestation work get stuck.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

528. Ah, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 318

529. Because the ego takes over the show.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 319

530. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. I can see that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I can absolutely see that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. So we want to rewrite the story, but we can't really rewrite the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. We just have to-- we can't rewrite the past story, but we can rewrite the now story with our choices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 320

535. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. You can rewrite the now story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. Now, when we talk about now, we're talking about now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 321

538. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 322

539. And now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. And now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. We're not talking about one second from now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 323

542. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

543. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. So the only thing, then, that you have in the now is your experience of the now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

545. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

546. So therefore, what you are really rewriting is your experience of the now--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

547. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

548. --which really has to do with your interpretation of the now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

549. And that, depending on that interpretation, will set us on a specific vibrational frequency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

550. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

551. And then, depending on that vibrational frequency, we see the past rewrite itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

552. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. So if your interpretation of the now is one of victimization--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

554. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 334

555. --guess what you're going to get.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 335

556. We're going to get a past history of Zetas abducting you every night against your will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 336

557. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

558. And if you are at a vibrational frequency of non-victimization, empowerment, then, you're going to be going on the ships and donating your stuff instead of actually being taken against your will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

559. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. And even-- getting out-- getting out of the ET stuff-- even we're talking about, is your boss picking on you at work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

561. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 340

562. So we're even talking about the human stuff here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

563. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. And then, shifting that perspective, shifting that now moment, now all of a sudden your boss is not picking on you, but got a greater plan or, you know, something, some other story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

566. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. And this brings in the whole other aspect of the emotional body because the ego, the insidious ego-- we say that with love because the ego is simply a neutral mechanism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. But the insidious ego will continue its dialogue with you that will tell you, well, if you're not shifting this now, you're not very spiritual.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. You're bad.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. You're failing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. And that that just further entrenches--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

572. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 344

573. --the anchor of the ego.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 345

574. So it's just a big lesson of allowance and acceptance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 346

575. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 347

577. And just being, really.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. And not the knee jerk reactions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 348

579. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. And watching yourself so that you can see your habits and patterns.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. And that's the key to your freedom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. And by embracing those emotions when they come, as opposed to pushing them away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 349

583. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 350

584. Ok.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
