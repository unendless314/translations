## Speaker Group 148

250. So it-- I kind of want to go back to the Pleiades and your star system now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. We have this definition of the Pleiades--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

252. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

253. --of, you know, the-- is it the Six Sisters?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. Seven Sisters?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

255. Seven Sisters, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

256. Seven Sisters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. And there's obviously-- because if you look through a micros-- or a telescope, you can see a lot more stars than just the seven stars that we see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

258. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

259. We-- we realize we did take a tangent off into something else from what you were asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. Basically speaking, we're actually going to jump back and answer part of this question and the other question that you had before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Basically speaking, the beings that you know of as Pleiadians are not indigenous to the area that you know of as Pleiades.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

263. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

264. So we have, basically, two genetic lines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. One comes from the ancient Lyra.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

266. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

267. And one comes from the ancient Lyra combined with Earth genetics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. That's another story, perhaps for another time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. So there's two different lines that eventually colonized in the area that you know of as Pleiades.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. So not really the Seven Sisters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. However, in the ancient days, when my people would visit your people on Earth, and we would be asked where are we from, well, if we pointed to those seven stars--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

272. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

273. --in that direction, they got the point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

274. I see. now the idea of humanity being a mixture well of course, it's no surprise to you that you know that there is a genetic connection between us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

275. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

276. And it comes from many, many different sources, some of which is the Lyran-- the original Lyran template DNA and Pleiadians evolving from that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. And then, also, working with the genetics on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. But we find this idea of simply looking at it genetically to be extremely limiting because nobody is indigenous to anywhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. You are originally one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

280. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

281. So again, we have to use metaphor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

282. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

283. If you take holographic film-- and the nature of holographic film is that if we were to take a picture of an apple and then cut up the film in tiny pieces, each tiny little piece would have the complete image of the apple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. And it doesn't matter how small you cut those pieces.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

285. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

286. So consciousness is fractal in that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

288. And therefore, no matter if you are a lowly human, so to speak, on Earth, here, at this time, you are fractally and holographically every other piece as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

289. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

290. So in that sense, then, the question is difficult to answer because our default setting is not linear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

291. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

292. And yet language is linear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

293. So you mean the Pleiadian-- where you are in your evolution--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

294. Yes. >> --is not linear, correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

295. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

296. And in our human system, our human OS, is sort of in a linear sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

297. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

298. So we're trying to match those.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

299. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. But you're really shifting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. My understanding is that the Pleiadian is a very feminine energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. Is that correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. Or is it very balanced, in that sense?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. I always perceived, or felt, more feminine energy, archetypal energy, related to the Pleiadian energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

306. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. Well, what you're going to find with-- again, not a simple answer to the question-- what you're going to find with my species, as well as many of the other core species in your galactic family, is that there's generally three eras of development.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. The first era is more of the infant species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. And it is in that first era where the issues, let's say, of each species that need to be healed, come up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. And then the second era tends to be the healing period when the integration starts, the healing happens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. The third era, which is, of course, the mature era, is when awakening, as a species, happens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. So my species, particularly, is felt as feminine in all three eras, which is really interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. And it's kind of rare because many of the other species are more felt masculine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

315. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

316. But the reason we are felt more feminine in all three eras is because as follows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. First era, we already told you that the tendency for my species was to not want to look at the shadow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. So we were kind of floating around in the spiritual bubble.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

319. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

320. All right, which is actually an unbalanced feminine energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

321. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

322. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. Then, when you go to the second era, and the integration happens, integration, or the act of integration, by its very nature is feminine because it's inclusive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. So all of that integration was creating a movement inward, which is a very feminine energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. And then, of course, in the third era, which is the awakened era, you have a species that is very balanced male female energy that is in an awakened state.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. And to a separated consciousness on Earth, that state feels very feminine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

327. So that's why I-- we're-- you know, myself and other people get that feeling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

328. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. And-- and this is going into some other races, but I was told that-- my understanding is that the Anunnaki were a hybrid race of Pleiadian and Draconian energies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. Is that-- do you see it from that perspective?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

331. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. We're going to be a little bit of a rebel, here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

333. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

334. Because the word Anunnaki in your Sumerian language, as far as we understand the definition, means those who have come down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

335. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

336. So Anunnaki is meaning, basically, those who came from the heavens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

337. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

338. So they were not one species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

339. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

340. They were many.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

341. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. That-- well, that clears up a lot of stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. A lot of questions I had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

345. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

346. So that-- that is interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. You know, we were trying to figure out why-- where did the Anunnaki get all this DNA the old story of enslaving-- making humans for slaves--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

348. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

349. --for mining gold.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

350. And that was only one particular family that did that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

351. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

352. But as you know, they're the ones that get the bad rap, yes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

353. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

355. The rotten apple spoils the bunch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

356. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
