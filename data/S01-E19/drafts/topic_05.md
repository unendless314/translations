## Speaker Group 148

250. So it-- I kind of want to go back to the Pleiades and your star system now.
→ {"text": "所以那個——我想現在回到昴宿星團和你們的星系上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. We have this definition of the Pleiades--
→ {"text": "我們對昴宿星團有這樣的定義——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

252. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

253. --of, you know, the-- is it the Six Sisters?
→ {"text": "——就是，你知道的，那個——是六姊妹嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Seven Sisters?
→ {"text": "七姊妹？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

255. Seven Sisters, yes.
→ {"text": "七姊妹，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

256. Seven Sisters.
→ {"text": "七姊妹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. And there's obviously-- because if you look through a micros-- or a telescope, you can see a lot more stars than just the seven stars that we see.
→ {"text": "而且很明顯——因為如果你透過顯微——或是望遠鏡來看，你可以看到比我們看到的七顆星更多的星星。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

258. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

259. We-- we realize we did take a tangent off into something else from what you were asking.
→ {"text": "我們——我們意識到我們確實從你所問的問題岔開到別的事情上了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Basically speaking, we're actually going to jump back and answer part of this question and the other question that you had before.
→ {"text": "基本上來說，我們實際上要跳回去回答這個問題的一部分以及你之前的另一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Basically speaking, the beings that you know of as Pleiadians are not indigenous to the area that you know of as Pleiades.
→ {"text": "基本上來說，你們所知的昴宿星人並非你們所知的昴宿星團那個區域的原住民。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

263. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

264. So we have, basically, two genetic lines.
→ {"text": "所以我們基本上有兩條基因線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. One comes from the ancient Lyra.
→ {"text": "一條來自古老的天琴座。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

266. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

267. And one comes from the ancient Lyra combined with Earth genetics.
→ {"text": "而另一條來自古老的天琴座結合地球基因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. That's another story, perhaps for another time.
→ {"text": "那是另一個故事了，也許留待下次再說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. So there's two different lines that eventually colonized in the area that you know of as Pleiades.
→ {"text": "所以有兩條不同的基因線最終在你們所知的昴宿星團那個區域殖民。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. So not really the Seven Sisters.
→ {"text": "所以不真的是七姊妹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. However, in the ancient days, when my people would visit your people on Earth, and we would be asked where are we from, well, if we pointed to those seven stars--
→ {"text": "然而，在古代，當我的族人拜訪你們地球上的人時，當我們被問到我們來自哪裡時，嗯，如果我們指向那七顆星——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

272. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

273. --in that direction, they got the point.
→ {"text": "——指向那個方向，他們就明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

274. I see. now the idea of humanity being a mixture well of course, it's no surprise to you that you know that there is a genetic connection between us.
→ {"text": "我懂了。現在關於人類是一個混合體的想法，嗯，當然，你知道我們之間存在基因連結對你來說並不意外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

275. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

276. And it comes from many, many different sources, some of which is the Lyran-- the original Lyran template DNA and Pleiadians evolving from that.
→ {"text": "而且它來自許多許多不同的來源，其中一些是天琴座的——原始的天琴座模板 DNA，以及從中演化出來的昴宿星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. And then, also, working with the genetics on Earth.
→ {"text": "然後，同樣地，還與地球上的基因一起作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. But we find this idea of simply looking at it genetically to be extremely limiting because nobody is indigenous to anywhere.
→ {"text": "但我們發現單純從基因角度來看待這件事極為侷限，因為沒有人是任何地方的原住民。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. You are originally one.
→ {"text": "你們原本就是一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

280. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

281. So again, we have to use metaphor.
→ {"text": "所以再次，我們必須使用比喻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

282. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

283. If you take holographic film-- and the nature of holographic film is that if we were to take a picture of an apple and then cut up the film in tiny pieces, each tiny little piece would have the complete image of the apple.
→ {"text": "如果你拿全息底片——而全息底片的本質是，如果我們拍一張蘋果的照片，然後把底片切成小片，每一個小小的碎片都會有完整的蘋果影像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. And it doesn't matter how small you cut those pieces.
→ {"text": "而且不管你把這些碎片切得多小都沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

285. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

286. So consciousness is fractal in that way.
→ {"text": "所以意識就是以那種方式呈碎形的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

288. And therefore, no matter if you are a lowly human, so to speak, on Earth, here, at this time, you are fractally and holographically every other piece as well.
→ {"text": "因此，不管你是否是一個，可以說，卑微的人類，在地球上，在這裡，在此時，你也同樣在碎形和全息上是其他每一個部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

289. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

290. So in that sense, then, the question is difficult to answer because our default setting is not linear.
→ {"text": "所以在那個意義上，這個問題很難回答，因為我們的預設狀態不是線性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

291. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

292. And yet language is linear.
→ {"text": "然而語言是線性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

293. So you mean the Pleiadian-- where you are in your evolution--
→ {"text": "所以你的意思是昴宿星人——你們在演化中所處的位置——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

294. Yes. >> --is not linear, correct?
→ {"text": "是的。——不是線性的，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

295. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

296. And in our human system, our human OS, is sort of in a linear sense.
→ {"text": "而在我們人類的系統中，我們人類的作業系統，在某種意義上是線性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

297. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

298. So we're trying to match those.
→ {"text": "所以我們試著讓這兩者對接。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

299. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. But you're really shifting.
→ {"text": "但你們確實正在轉變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. My understanding is that the Pleiadian is a very feminine energy.
→ {"text": "我的理解是昴宿星人是一種非常陰性的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. Is that correct?
→ {"text": "這樣說對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. Or is it very balanced, in that sense?
→ {"text": "還是說在那個意義上是非常平衡的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. I always perceived, or felt, more feminine energy, archetypal energy, related to the Pleiadian energy.
→ {"text": "我總是感知到，或感覺到，更多的陰性能量、原型能量，與昴宿星能量有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

306. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. Well, what you're going to find with-- again, not a simple answer to the question-- what you're going to find with my species, as well as many of the other core species in your galactic family, is that there's generally three eras of development.
→ {"text": "嗯，你會發現——再次強調，這個問題沒有簡單的答案——你會發現我的物種，以及你們銀河家族中許多其他核心物種，通常都有三個發展時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. The first era is more of the infant species.
→ {"text": "第一個時代更像是嬰兒期的物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. And it is in that first era where the issues, let's say, of each species that need to be healed, come up.
→ {"text": "而正是在第一個時代，可以說，每個物種需要療癒的課題會浮現出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. And then the second era tends to be the healing period when the integration starts, the healing happens.
→ {"text": "然後第二個時代往往是療癒期，當整合開始時，療癒發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. The third era, which is, of course, the mature era, is when awakening, as a species, happens.
→ {"text": "第三個時代，當然就是成熟期，是當作為一個物種的覺醒發生時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. So my species, particularly, is felt as feminine in all three eras, which is really interesting.
→ {"text": "所以我的物種，特別地，在所有三個時代都被感受為陰性的，這真的很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. And it's kind of rare because many of the other species are more felt masculine.
→ {"text": "而這有點罕見，因為許多其他物種更多被感受為陽性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

315. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

316. But the reason we are felt more feminine in all three eras is because as follows.
→ {"text": "但我們在所有三個時代都被感受為更陰性的原因如下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. First era, we already told you that the tendency for my species was to not want to look at the shadow.
→ {"text": "第一個時代，我們已經告訴你，我的物種的傾向是不想去看見陰影。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. So we were kind of floating around in the spiritual bubble.
→ {"text": "所以我們有點漂浮在靈性泡泡裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

319. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

320. All right, which is actually an unbalanced feminine energy.
→ {"text": "好的，這實際上是一種不平衡的陰性能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

321. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯-嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

322. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. Then, when you go to the second era, and the integration happens, integration, or the act of integration, by its very nature is feminine because it's inclusive.
→ {"text": "然後，當你進入第二個時代，整合發生時，整合，或者說整合的行為，就其本質而言是陰性的，因為它具有包容性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. So all of that integration was creating a movement inward, which is a very feminine energy.
→ {"text": "所以所有那些整合都在創造一種向內的運動，這是一種非常陰性的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. And then, of course, in the third era, which is the awakened era, you have a species that is very balanced male female energy that is in an awakened state.
→ {"text": "然後，當然，在第三個時代，也就是覺醒時代，你有一個非常平衡陰陽能量且處於覺醒狀態的物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. And to a separated consciousness on Earth, that state feels very feminine.
→ {"text": "而對地球上的分離意識來說，那個狀態感覺非常陰性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

327. So that's why I-- we're-- you know, myself and other people get that feeling.
→ {"text": "所以這就是為什麼我——我們——你知道，我自己和其他人會有那種感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

328. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And-- and this is going into some other races, but I was told that-- my understanding is that the Anunnaki were a hybrid race of Pleiadian and Draconian energies.
→ {"text": "而且——這又涉及到其他一些種族了，但我被告知——我的理解是阿努納奇是昴宿星和天龍座能量的混種族群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. Is that-- do you see it from that perspective?
→ {"text": "那個——你是從那個角度看的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

331. No.
→ {"text": "不是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. We're going to be a little bit of a rebel, here.
→ {"text": "我們在這裡要稍微當個叛逆者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

333. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

334. Because the word Anunnaki in your Sumerian language, as far as we understand the definition, means those who have come down.
→ {"text": "因為阿努納奇這個詞在你們的蘇美爾語中，就我們對這個定義的理解而言，意思是那些已經降臨的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

335. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

336. So Anunnaki is meaning, basically, those who came from the heavens.
→ {"text": "所以阿努納奇的意思，基本上就是那些從天而降者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

337. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

338. So they were not one species.
→ {"text": "所以他們不是單一物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

339. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

340. They were many.
→ {"text": "他們是許多物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

341. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "哦，好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. That-- well, that clears up a lot of stuff.
→ {"text": "那個——嗯，那澄清了很多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. A lot of questions I had.
→ {"text": "我的很多疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

345. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

346. So that-- that is interesting.
→ {"text": "所以那個——那很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. You know, we were trying to figure out why-- where did the Anunnaki get all this DNA the old story of enslaving-- making humans for slaves--
→ {"text": "你知道，我們一直試圖搞清楚為什麼——阿努納奇從哪裡得到所有這些 DNA，那個關於奴役的老故事——製造人類當奴隸——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

348. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

349. --for mining gold.
→ {"text": "——為了挖掘黃金。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

350. And that was only one particular family that did that.
→ {"text": "而那只是一個特定的家族做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

351. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

352. But as you know, they're the ones that get the bad rap, yes?
→ {"text": "但如你所知，他們就是那些背負惡名的，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

353. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

355. The rotten apple spoils the bunch.
→ {"text": "一顆爛蘋果壞了一整籃。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

356. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
