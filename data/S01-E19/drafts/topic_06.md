357. So speaking of DNA and when that race of beings, or that family, took all these various DNAs from different star systems and created the human structure, um, how did that work in the beginning?
→ {"text": "所以說到 DNA，當那個存有種族，或說那個家族，從不同的星系取得各種不同的 DNA 並創造出人類結構時，嗯，那在一開始是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Or was there this-- again, this-- there had to be an agreement of sorts, otherwise it wouldn't have happened.
→ {"text": "或者說，是有那個——我是說，這個——一定有某種協議存在，否則這件事不會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

359. Of course, there's always an agreement.
→ {"text": "當然，總是有協議存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

360. Yeah.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

361. However, again, we have to say that-- we have to look at it from a non-human perspective.
→ {"text": "然而，我們還是必須說——我們必須從非人類的視角來看待這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. Now, you're quite familiar with other channeled information and such talking about, basically, if something is happening, or something is arising, there must be a higher purpose.
→ {"text": "現在，你對其他通靈訊息和諸如此類的說法相當熟悉，基本上就是說，如果有什麼事正在發生，或是有什麼事正在浮現，那一定有更高的目的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. And that is not, in any way, meant to be a cop out.
→ {"text": "而這絕對不是在用任何方式逃避問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. It's simply the way the universe works.
→ {"text": "這就只是宇宙運作的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

366. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

367. There is no mistakes--
→ {"text": "在創造中沒有錯誤——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

368. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

369. --in creation.
→ {"text": "——在創造中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. Now, in those ancient days, we have to say that your Earth, or your solar system, could be likened to what you call the wild, wild west.
→ {"text": "現在，在那些遠古的日子裡，我們必須說你們的地球，或者說你們的太陽系，可以比擬為你們所說的「蠻荒西部」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

371. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. Feels like that today, still, but--
→ {"text": "今天感覺仍然是那樣，但是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

373. Well, yes, it is.
→ {"text": "嗯，是的，是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. It is.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. But it's a little bit more colonized now.
→ {"text": "但現在稍微更開化一些了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

376. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

377. So it was an isolated place.
→ {"text": "所以那是個孤立的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. And because of that isolation, a lot went on, that was very fragmented with groups, one group having one agenda, one group having another agenda and conflicts and things such as that.
→ {"text": "而且因為那種孤立狀態，發生了很多事，各個族群之間非常分裂，一個族群有一個議程，另一個族群又有另一個議程，還有衝突等等這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. All because these forefathers of yours were a very young species.
→ {"text": "這一切都是因為你們的這些祖先是非常年輕的物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. This doesn't happen with older species.
→ {"text": "這種事不會發生在更古老的物種身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. Only with younger ones.
→ {"text": "只會發生在年輕的物種身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

382. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. So you sort of answered the question earlier, that, yes, there was some sort of higher purpose.
→ {"text": "所以你剛才某種程度上回答了這個問題，也就是說，是的，確實有某種更高的目的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. And therefore, these other races sort of lend their DNA for this higher purpose.
→ {"text": "因此，這些其他種族某種程度上為了這個更高的目的而貢獻了他們的 DNA。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

385. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

386. It wasn't stolen or taken and put-- you know, I'm going to go drug the Arcturian and then grab some DNA or some mojo--
→ {"text": "那不是被偷走或被奪取然後放進去的——你知道，不是說我要去給大角星人下藥然後抓一些 DNA 或什麼魔力——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

387. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. That makes a wonderful science fiction movie.
→ {"text": "那可以拍成一部很棒的科幻電影。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

389. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

390. But it's not quite the way things work.
→ {"text": "但事情的運作方式並不完全是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

391. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

392. One of the things that we've said to many people, sometimes, that ask questions about this is that from the perspective outside of the Earth, or from a fourth density perspective, let's say, this idea of the sharing of DNA and the shaping of cultures using DNA is actually a very natural process.
→ {"text": "我們有時候對許多詢問這個問題的人說的其中一件事是，從地球之外的視角來看，或者說從第四密度的視角來看，這個分享 DNA 以及利用 DNA 來塑造文明的概念，實際上是個非常自然的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. It's kind of like pollination--
→ {"text": "這有點像授粉——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

394. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

395. --on your world.
→ {"text": "——在你們的世界上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. And when you look at it-- when you remove the victim-perpetrator idea--
→ {"text": "而且當你看待這件事時——當你移除受害者-加害者概念時——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

397. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

398. --which is really only applicable in a very polarized third density reality, then the whole paradigm changes, actually.
→ {"text": "——而這其實只適用於非常極化的第三密度實相，那麼整個範式實際上就改變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

399. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

400. But the question, then, is why?
→ {"text": "但問題是，那為什麼呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. Why do people have these experiences of being a victim and things such as that.
→ {"text": "為什麼人們會有這些成為受害者的經驗以及諸如此類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

402. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

403. Why do those buttons get pushed?
→ {"text": "為什麼這些按鈕會被按下？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. Well, when you are a third-density species, in a sense, you can say there are many passages, spiritual passages, that you have to go through in order to evolve your consciousness on the way to fourth density.
→ {"text": "嗯，當你是第三密度物種時，在某種意義上，你可以說有很多通道，靈性通道，你必須通過這些通道才能在通往第四密度的路上進化你的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. One of those passages has to do with the healing of the clinging to the idea of victim and perpetrator.
→ {"text": "其中一個通道與療癒對受害者與加害者概念的執著有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. And many civilizations get stuck there for millennia.
→ {"text": "而許多文明在那裡卡住了數千年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. And so when you have-- well, we're bringing in another tangent, here.
→ {"text": "所以當你有——嗯，我們又在這裡帶入另一個話題了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

408. No, that's fine.
→ {"text": "不，沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

409. But when you have the situation with the Zetas and the so-called abductions, it triggered the same issues humanity has been playing out for so many thousands of years, but this time from space.
→ {"text": "但是當你有網罟座灰人和所謂的綁架這種情況時，它觸發了人類已經上演了幾千年的相同議題，但這一次是來自太空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. Are there victims?
→ {"text": "有受害者嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. Are there perpetrators?
→ {"text": "有加害者嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. And on the individual level of those who were claiming abduction, the reason it's happening is because they have to pass through that gate in order to shift their consciousness and integrate the polarity within themselves.
→ {"text": "而在那些聲稱被綁架的人的個人層面上，這件事發生的原因是因為他們必須通過那道門，才能轉變他們的意識並整合他們內在的極性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. And then, on a collective level, it happens on a collective level, as well, that changing of the paradigm.
→ {"text": "然後，在集體層面上，在集體層面上也發生了這個範式的改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. And therefore, a passage into fourth density can be made, or one of the steps of the passage.
→ {"text": "因此，可以進入第四密度的通道，或是通道的其中一個步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

415. So without the Zeta abduction, temporary detainment, experience, then, we wouldn't even have the opportunity to heal that wound to move into fourth density.
→ {"text": "所以如果沒有網罟座灰人的綁架、暫時拘留的經驗，那麼我們甚至不會有機會療癒那個創傷以進入第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

416. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. Or you would have re-created something else.
→ {"text": "或者你們會重新創造其他東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

418. Some other scenario.
→ {"text": "某個其他情境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

419. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

420. Yeah, we would have.
→ {"text": "是啊，我們會的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. But at least we got to have it in that way so we could connect to our cosmic family.
→ {"text": "但至少我們以那種方式擁有它，這樣我們就可以連結到我們的宇宙家族。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

422. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

423. As opposed to, you know, making another story on Earth.
→ {"text": "而不是，你知道，在地球上製造另一個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

424. Yes, because in the Orion civilization, they didn't create that-- the healing of that through the ET contact.
→ {"text": "是的，因為在獵戶座文明中，他們並沒有創造那個——透過外星接觸來療癒那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. They created it through a domineering empire.
→ {"text": "他們是透過一個專制的帝國來創造它的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

426. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. And that was the Orion Wars?
→ {"text": "那就是獵戶座戰爭？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

428. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

429. Was-- was the Pleiadian-- your society involved in those wars?
→ {"text": "昴宿星——你們的社會有參與那些戰爭嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

430. Shamefully, yes.
→ {"text": "慚愧地說，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. We're making a joke.
→ {"text": "我們在開玩笑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

432. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

433. Now, again, those conflicts lasted for a very, very long time.
→ {"text": "現在，那些衝突持續了非常、非常長的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. So there was a period of time, when my species was very young, that our mindset was kind of like a teenager in your human counting.
→ {"text": "所以有一段時間，當我的物種非常年輕的時候，我們的心態有點像你們人類算法中的青少年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. You know, gung ho, do this, jump in without thinking of the consequences.
→ {"text": "你知道，就是那種非常熱血的，做這個，跳進去而不考慮後果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

436. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

437. And so we did that.
→ {"text": "所以我們就那樣做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. And as you say in your vernacular, got our asses kicked.
→ {"text": "而且用你們的俗語來說，被踢了屁股。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. And that brought up the issues of the guilt and all that kind of stuff that we had to work on as a species in order to make our shift.
→ {"text": "而且那引發了罪疚感的議題以及所有我們物種必須處理的東西，才能進行轉變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. So in that way, there's nothing extraneous.
→ {"text": "所以在那種意義上，沒有什麼是多餘的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

441. So now, obviously, that period of time is over and, hopefully, the Orion-- and we say now.
→ {"text": "所以現在，很明顯，那段時間已經結束了，而且，希望獵戶座——而我們說現在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. And obviously time-- and I guess, you know, I'm just-- where you are with your evolution, you've cleared that up.
→ {"text": "而且很明顯時間——我想，你知道，我只是——在你們演化的位置上，你們已經清理了那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. You've been through that.
→ {"text": "你們已經經歷過那個了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. You've had this-- we have the story of the Orion Wars to tell to-- so we can keep-- you heal--
→ {"text": "你們已經有了這個——我們有獵戶座戰爭的故事可以講給——所以我們可以持續——你們療癒——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

445. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

446. --some future generations.
→ {"text": "——一些未來的世代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. Because hey, we've been there, we've done that.
→ {"text": "因為嘿，我們去過那裡，我們做過那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 261

448. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. And there are some residuals finishing up on your world, as well.
→ {"text": "而且在你們的世界上也有一些殘留正在收尾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

450. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. With the Orion Wars.
→ {"text": "關於獵戶座戰爭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

452. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

453. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. And because again-- so I've-- you know, I've heard this analogy that everything that's happening on Earth is sort of-- the micro and the macro, so--
→ {"text": "而且因為又——所以我——你知道，我聽過這個類比，就是地球上發生的一切都有點像是——微觀和宏觀，所以——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

455. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

456. --you know, if we go back just 20 years maybe in our timeline, then the Orion Wars are still happening kind of in a way, depending on which timeline we're in, I guess.
→ {"text": "——你知道，如果我們在時間線上回溯也許只是 20 年，那麼獵戶座戰爭在某種程度上仍然在發生，我想，取決於我們在哪條時間線上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

457. It really depends on what you are connecting with, energetically.
→ {"text": "這真的取決於你在能量上連結到什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

458. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. And so that-- instead of looking at it from a linear sense, the vibrational frequency of where we're at, if we're vibrating at that frequency, then, yes, the Orion Wars are still happening.
→ {"text": "所以那個——與其從線性的角度來看待它，我們所處位置的振動頻率，如果我們正在以那個頻率振動，那麼，是的，獵戶座戰爭仍然在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

460. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

461. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

462. For instance, people in your world who live in the Middle East, who are embroiled in extreme polarity and extreme control--
→ {"text": "例如，你們世界上住在中東的人，那些陷入極端極性和極端控制之中的人——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

463. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

464. --are directly connecting, still, to that era of Orion.
→ {"text": "——仍然在直接連結到獵戶座的那個時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

465. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

466. Whereas, perhaps, you, in your daily life, are not.
→ {"text": "而也許你，在你的日常生活中，則沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

467. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. So instead of seeing time linearly in that sense, it's just more of a vibrational frequency.
→ {"text": "所以與其在那種意義上線性地看待時間，它更多的只是一個振動頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

470. Yes, and it's very fluid.
→ {"text": "是的，而且它非常流動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

471. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. And that-- so we can sort of see time in our daily lives, too.
→ {"text": "而且那個——所以我們在日常生活中也可以某種程度上看到時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. And if we can see everything as a vibrational frequency, then, maybe we can get through, navigate through this frequency soup, I like to call it, a little bit easier.
→ {"text": "而且如果我們可以把一切都視為振動頻率，那麼，也許我們就可以更容易地通過、穿越這個我喜歡稱之為頻率湯的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

474. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. You're in a very-- as you well know, you're in a very interesting time right now, because in a sense you have one foot in third density, one foot in fourth.
→ {"text": "你們正處於一個非常——如你所知，你們現在正處於一個非常有趣的時期，因為在某種意義上你們一腳踩在第三密度，一腳踩在第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. You're taking the foot out of third density.
→ {"text": "你們正在把腳從第三密度抽出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

477. But because it's a spectrum, and there's a gradation as the energy changes, you're still going to have challenges with the old way of doing things as the new structures are arising.
→ {"text": "但因為這是個光譜，而且隨著能量改變會有漸變，在新結構升起的同時，你們仍然會面對舊的做事方式帶來的挑戰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

478. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

479. So this is really the most tenuous time and also the most challenging one.
→ {"text": "所以這真的是最脆弱的時期，也是最具挑戰性的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

480. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. But also the most--
→ {"text": "但也是最——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

482. Exciting.
→ {"text": "令人興奮的時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

483. --exciting because the shift, the daily shifts, are happening at such an exponential rate that we really can take notice.
→ {"text": "——令人興奮，因為這個轉變，日常的轉變，正在以指數級的速度發生，我們真的可以注意到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

484. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

485. And see these changes.
→ {"text": "而且看到這些變化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

486. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

487. And that's exciting.
→ {"text": "而那是令人興奮的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

488. Exactly, yes.
→ {"text": "正是如此，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

489. Exciting.
→ {"text": "令人興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

490. And it's exciting for us to watch, too.
→ {"text": "而且對我們來說，觀看這一切也是令人興奮的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

491. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
