## Speaker Group 212

357. So speaking of DNA and when that race of beings, or that family, took all these various DNAs from different star systems and created the human structure, um, how did that work in the beginning?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Or was there this-- again, this-- there had to be an agreement of sorts, otherwise it wouldn't have happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

359. Of course, there's always an agreement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

360. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

361. However, again, we have to say that-- we have to look at it from a non-human perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. Now, you're quite familiar with other channeled information and such talking about, basically, if something is happening, or something is arising, there must be a higher purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. And that is not, in any way, meant to be a cop out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. It's simply the way the universe works.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

366. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

367. There is no mistakes--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

368. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

369. --in creation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. Now, in those ancient days, we have to say that your Earth, or your solar system, could be likened to what you call the wild, wild west.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

371. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Feels like that today, still, but--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

373. Well, yes, it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. It is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. But it's a little bit more colonized now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

376. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

377. So it was an isolated place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. And because of that isolation, a lot went on, that was very fragmented with groups, one group having one agenda, one group having another agenda and conflicts and things such as that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. All because these forefathers of yours were a very young species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. This doesn't happen with older species.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. Only with younger ones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

382. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. So you sort of answered the question earlier, that, yes, there was some sort of higher purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. And therefore, these other races sort of lend their DNA for this higher purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

385. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

386. It wasn't stolen or taken and put-- you know, I'm going to go drug the Arcturian and then grab some DNA or some mojo--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

387. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. That makes a wonderful science fiction movie.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

389. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

390. But it's not quite the way things work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

391. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

392. One of the things that we've said to many people, sometimes, that ask questions about this is that from the perspective outside of the Earth, or from a fourth density perspective, let's say, this idea of the sharing of DNA and the shaping of cultures using DNA is actually a very natural process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. It's kind of like pollination--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

394. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

395. --on your world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. And when you look at it-- when you remove the victim-perpetrator idea--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

397. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

398. --which is really only applicable in a very polarized third density reality, then the whole paradigm changes, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

399. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

400. But the question, then, is why?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. Why do people have these experiences of being a victim and things such as that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

402. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

403. Why do those buttons get pushed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. Well, when you are a third-density species, in a sense, you can say there are many passages, spiritual passages, that you have to go through in order to evolve your consciousness on the way to fourth density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. One of those passages has to do with the healing of the clinging to the idea of victim and perpetrator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. And many civilizations get stuck there for millennia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. And so when you have-- well, we're bringing in another tangent, here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

408. No, that's fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

409. But when you have the situation with the Zetas and the so-called abductions, it triggered the same issues humanity has been playing out for so many thousands of years, but this time from space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Are there victims?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. Are there perpetrators?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. And on the individual level of those who were claiming abduction, the reason it's happening is because they have to pass through that gate in order to shift their consciousness and integrate the polarity within themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. And then, on a collective level, it happens on a collective level, as well, that changing of the paradigm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. And therefore, a passage into fourth density can be made, or one of the steps of the passage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

415. So without the Zeta abduction, temporary detainment, experience, then, we wouldn't even have the opportunity to heal that wound to move into fourth density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

416. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. Or you would have re-created something else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

418. Some other scenario.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

419. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

420. Yeah, we would have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. But at least we got to have it in that way so we could connect to our cosmic family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

422. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

423. As opposed to, you know, making another story on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

424. Yes, because in the Orion civilization, they didn't create that-- the healing of that through the ET contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. They created it through a domineering empire.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

426. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. And that was the Orion Wars?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

428. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

429. Was-- was the Pleiadian-- your society involved in those wars?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

430. Shamefully, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. We're making a joke.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

432. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

433. Now, again, those conflicts lasted for a very, very long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. So there was a period of time, when my species was very young, that our mindset was kind of like a teenager in your human counting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. You know, gung ho, do this, jump in without thinking of the consequences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

436. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

437. And so we did that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. And as you say in your vernacular, got our asses kicked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. And that brought up the issues of the guilt and all that kind of stuff that we had to work on as a species in order to make our shift.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. So in that way, there's nothing extraneous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

441. So now, obviously, that period of time is over and, hopefully, the Orion-- and we say now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. And obviously time-- and I guess, you know, I'm just-- where you are with your evolution, you've cleared that up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. You've been through that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. You've had this-- we have the story of the Orion Wars to tell to-- so we can keep-- you heal--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

445. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

446. --some future generations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Because hey, we've been there, we've done that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 261

448. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. And there are some residuals finishing up on your world, as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

450. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. With the Orion Wars.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

452. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

453. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. And because again-- so I've-- you know, I've heard this analogy that everything that's happening on Earth is sort of-- the micro and the macro, so--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

455. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

456. --you know, if we go back just 20 years maybe in our timeline, then the Orion Wars are still happening kind of in a way, depending on which timeline we're in, I guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

457. It really depends on what you are connecting with, energetically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

458. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. And so that-- instead of looking at it from a linear sense, the vibrational frequency of where we're at, if we're vibrating at that frequency, then, yes, the Orion Wars are still happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

460. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

461. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

462. For instance, people in your world who live in the Middle East, who are embroiled in extreme polarity and extreme control--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

463. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

464. --are directly connecting, still, to that era of Orion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

465. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

466. Whereas, perhaps, you, in your daily life, are not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

467. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. So instead of seeing time linearly in that sense, it's just more of a vibrational frequency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

470. Yes, and it's very fluid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

471. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. And that-- so we can sort of see time in our daily lives, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. And if we can see everything as a vibrational frequency, then, maybe we can get through, navigate through this frequency soup, I like to call it, a little bit easier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

474. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. You're in a very-- as you well know, you're in a very interesting time right now, because in a sense you have one foot in third density, one foot in fourth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. You're taking the foot out of third density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. But because it's a spectrum, and there's a gradation as the energy changes, you're still going to have challenges with the old way of doing things as the new structures are arising.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

478. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

479. So this is really the most tenuous time and also the most challenging one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

480. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. But also the most--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

482. Exciting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

483. --exciting because the shift, the daily shifts, are happening at such an exponential rate that we really can take notice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

484. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

485. And see these changes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

486. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

487. And that's exciting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

488. Exactly, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

489. Exciting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

490. And it's exciting for us to watch, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

491. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
