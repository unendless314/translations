So the Essassani, the Essassani especially, and the hybrid species are playing a very important role that has to do with alchemy.  What do we mean by that?  Well the idea of alchemy is the bringing together of two seemingly conflicting ideas that create a response when they come

  source_text: And this is, let's say, energy dynamics 101 in terms of species evolution.  So whenever you get to a planet that is moving from 3rd to 4th density, they are going to have to integrate the mental and emotional bodies, and they do so through a form of alchemy.  So the Essassani, in a sense, are the alchemists or the representations of successful alchemy.  >>Okay.  >>And you see it at a... through
