69. If beings of higher intelligence are here... ...what is their purpose?

73. So I thought to myself, why not ask the aliens directly?

75. Well, sort of...

76. Nora.

77. Reuben.

78. Here we are, thank you for doing this second time, sort of.  We've been filming you on and off here.

79. Um.
→ {"text": "嗯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. Can you describe to me the process of what do you do and what kind of energies do you tap into and then hopefully we can tap into them today?
→ {"text": "你能向我描述一下你做什麼的過程，以及你接入了什麼樣的能量嗎？然後希望我們今天也能接入這些能量？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Sure. So I do what's called direct voice channeling.
→ {"text": "當然。所以我做的是所謂的直接聲音通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. I also translate, so there are two different versions of channeling work.
→ {"text": "我也做翻譯，所以有兩種不同版本的通靈工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. Translation is, I listen and receive and then tell you in my own voice the information I'm getting and what I hear and often do that when I work privately in one-on-one sessions I'll do some translation work and I'll use my own voice and they've expressed the importance of us, all of us, accessing information in a variety of ways.
→ {"text": "翻譯是，我聆聽和接收，然後用我自己的聲音告訴你我得到的資訊以及我聽到的內容。我經常在私下一對一的療癒時這樣做，我會做一些翻譯工作，使用我自己的聲音。他們表達了我們所有人以各種方式獲取資訊的重要性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. So that's one of the ways I access information, but then I also direct voice channel.
→ {"text": "所以這是我獲取資訊的方式之一，但我也進行直接聲音通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. So direct voice channel means I raise my personal vibration to a point where I can connect up with beings who exist in a higher dimension, another vibration, another frequency. They interact with me telepathically, move through me energetically, I allow them to alter my vocal cords, speak directly through me.
→ {"text": "所以直接聲音通靈意味著我提升我的個人振動到一個點，在那裡我可以與存在於更高維度、另一個振動、另一個頻率的存有連結。他們以心電感應的方式與我互動，在能量上穿過我，我允許他們改變我的聲帶，直接透過我說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
