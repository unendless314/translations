62. Ever wonder if there's intelligent life elsewhere in the universe?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

64. My name is Reuben Langdon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. And on March 29th, 2007, in the middle of the day, I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. Coincidentally, I was working on the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. And ever since then I've been on a quest...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so... ...are they here with us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. If beings of higher intelligence are here... ...what is their purpose?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. Why don't they make themselves more known?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. Why the secrecy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. I've asked these questions to many experts, yet, each seems to have a different theory.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. So I thought to myself, why not ask the aliens directly?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. So that's what I set out to do!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. Well, sort of...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. Nora.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. Reuben.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. Here we are, thank you for doing this second time, sort of.  We've been filming you on and off here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. Um.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. Can you describe to me the process of what do you do and what kind of energies do you tap into and then hopefully we can tap into them today?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Sure. So I do what's called direct voice channeling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. I also translate, so there are two different versions of channeling work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Translation is, I listen and receive and then tell you in my own voice the information I'm getting and what I hear and often do that when I work privately in one-on-one sessions I'll do some translation work and I'll use my own voice and they've expressed the importance of us, all of us, accessing information in a variety of ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. So that's one of the ways I access information, but then I also direct voice channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. So direct voice channel means I raise my personal vibration to a point where I can connect up with beings who exist in a higher dimension, another vibration, another frequency. They interact with me telepathically, move through me energetically, I allow them to alter my vocal cords, speak directly through me.
