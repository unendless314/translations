## Speaker Group 1

122. Zoe, you're now part of the movie, officially.

123. So this is Zoe. Zoe is an elf and a unicorn. We like to call Zoe the Alphacorn because she brings through the elfin and the unicorn energies strongly in our space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. We have a couple of cats, one is bringing through the fairy vibration and the other Pleiadian frequency and vibration. Animals, they are definitely helping us here on so many levels. We've had Zoe now for just a little over a year and she has brought with her such an amazing transmission of unconditional love and fun and play, our entire reality has shifted with her presence.

125. I've noticed that with animals, if humans could operate on an animal level in so many ways that you know where we... it's like they do something and we're mad at them but then they're in the doghouse so to say, but two minutes later they're: oh I didn't do anything, or I forgive you or whatever. You know they can't, even if you are physically angry with them or something, they'll you know:
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. it's okay, the ultimate show of how to forgive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. Yes. And also how to be present.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. They're extremely in the moment, they don't tie their moments together in the way that we do and they also don't filter out the information that our mental bodies filter out. Coming back to, back around to that -- thank you, Zoe -- so I'm aware that Zoey and Izzy and Ursula the Smurf, our cats, are always interacting with the beings that are present in our space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. I see them watching the beings and seeing things that I can't access in the moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Excellent. Well thanks guys, let us know if something pops in here, maybe we'll catch it on film.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Well, I guess the last question before we move in is: when you were trying to find labels I guess, or if you weren't even trying but did they present themselves and say I am such and such, I am Pleiadian Collective, I am Calliandra. Is that how it happened or were you able to... how did that come to you, for each? So initially it wasn't that easy. Okay yeah, that's what I figured,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. I knew there'd be a story to this. With the Pleiadians it was easy. Immediately I recognized that the transmission from the Pleiadians as a Pleiadian transmission.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. I recognized it in my body, in a visceral way. It was very clear to me that's who I was in contact with, and I'd been aware of the Pleiadian energy so my mental body had already accepted the truth of the Pleiadian Collective and their work with us here on Earth. So when they made direct contact with me, my mental body didn't freak out and try to screen out that piece of information, it
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. was clear to me. Now many of the other beings that I've worked with, it's taken me some time to kind of work my way into discerning who it was I was connecting with. Now when I say time, I mean perhaps a matter of minutes or hours, yes. It's never been longer than that and that's just I guess part of my operating system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. Calliandra, for instance, when she first made herself known to me, I felt a new being link up with me -- I was preparing for radio interview that night -- I could feel this really wonderful playful presence, and immediately I knew it to be fairy. So again Nora had accepted fairies, that was easy, ah I know this vibration to be fairy. So I asked for a name and I got the name initially Calliana. So I was
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. playing with Calliana, I was like okay, and I thought no, that's not quite right, and then I got Calliandra -- got it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. As soon as I heard, felt, that's really predominantly how I access information when I'm not in the semi-conscious direct voice channeling state, ok? So when Nora is conscious and awake, and when I choose to seek out information as Nora, meaning information I can't just read from a book or you know, I feel it and I hear it. I hear the words. I see it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. I see it sometimes like words on the paper. I see the story. Very occasionally I access more of my clairvoyant abilities, meaning I will see an image, I'll see some light, I'll see a story playing out in my mind's eye. So I felt, heard, the name Calliandra and thought okay her name is Calliandra. And then I had to go outside and ground myself because I was working with a new vibration, a new
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. frequency and I found it actually really powerful and intense to work with a fifth dimensional being. So I was used to working with these very, very high vibrations and high frequencies which were in some ways easier to work with because it's so... well, any of you listening right now, if you just take a breath, you can tune into that light high, high vibration. Imagine it's
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. like interacting with a cloud, yes, gentle easy, right. Calliandra was like interacting with a sledgehammer, her energy was so powerful because she has more density to her vibration as a fifth dimensional being. So I had to go outside and stand on the ground. And then I came in and sat in front of my computer and I thought I'm gonna look up the word Calliandra and see what I find, because I
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. like to also, if I can, back up my other dimensional information with third dimensional information and I googled the word Calliandra, and it's a plant called Fairy Duster and I'd not ever heard that word before and it was such a moment of validation for me, which was great. I was gonna go on the radio that night and introduce a new being, so how wonderful that I got that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. So the information you got was Calliandra the fairy and then the validation was caught under the name...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. So that took me a couple of hours to answer that question and discerning frequencies and vibrations. Sometimes when I'm working with a client and someone who's passed, connects up with me, you know sometimes I'll feel immediately like oh this is their mother whose passed. And that's work that I don't do a lot of but I do do it occasionally when it's necessary. They will present themselves
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. to me and then typically I'll just ask them questions of the client you know where's your mother is usually how I'll start, as opposed to I've made contact with your mother, because that can be startling for somebody who's lost...
