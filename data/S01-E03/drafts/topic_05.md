## Speaker Group 1

122. Zoe, you're now part of the movie, officially.
→ {"text": "佐伊（Zoe），你現在正式成為電影的一部分了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "首次出現寵物名使用中英對照"}

123. So this is Zoe. Zoe is an elf and a unicorn. We like to call Zoe the Alphacorn because she brings through the elfin and the unicorn energies strongly in our space.
→ {"text": "這就是佐伊。佐伊是精靈也是獨角獸。我們喜歡稱她為精靈獨角獸（Alphacorn），因為她在我們的空間中強烈地帶來精靈與獨角獸的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Alphacorn 依 terminology.yaml 譯為精靈獨角獸，首次出現加註英文"}

124. We have a couple of cats, one is bringing through the fairy vibration and the other Pleiadian frequency and vibration. Animals, they are definitely helping us here on so many levels. We've had Zoe now for just a little over a year and she has brought with her such an amazing transmission of unconditional love and fun and play, our entire reality has shifted with her presence.
→ {"text": "我們還有兩隻貓，一隻帶來仙子的頻率，另一隻帶來昴宿星的頻率與振動。動物們確實在許多層面上幫助著我們。我們養佐伊至今剛好一年多一點，她帶來了如此驚人的無條件的愛、樂趣與遊戲的傳遞，她的出現讓我們整個實相都轉變了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "frequency and vibration 並列時保持兩者，依 terminology.yaml"}

125. I've noticed that with animals, if humans could operate on an animal level in so many ways that you know where we... it's like they do something and we're mad at them but then they're in the doghouse so to say, but two minutes later they're: oh I didn't do anything, or I forgive you or whatever. You know they can't, even if you are physically angry with them or something, they'll you know:
→ {"text": "我注意到動物們有一點，如果人類能在許多方面像動物那樣運作的話……就像是他們做了什麼事讓我們生氣，然後他們被打入冷宮，但兩分鐘後他們就：噢我什麼都沒做，或者我原諒你，諸如此類。你知道他們無法……即使你對他們肉身上發怒或什麼的，他們還是會：", "confidence": "high", "notes": "口語化表達，保留未完成句子的自然語氣"}

126. it's okay, the ultimate show of how to forgive.
→ {"text": "沒關係，這是如何寬恕的終極示範。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. Yes. And also how to be present.
→ {"text": "是的。還有如何活在當下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. They're extremely in the moment, they don't tie their moments together in the way that we do and they also don't filter out the information that our mental bodies filter out. Coming back to, back around to that -- thank you, Zoe -- so I'm aware that Zoey and Izzy and Ursula the Smurf, our cats, are always interacting with the beings that are present in our space.
→ {"text": "他們極度活在當下，不會像我們那樣把時刻串連在一起，他們也不會過濾掉我們心智體會過濾掉的資訊。回到，再繞回那個話題——謝謝你，佐伊——所以我知道佐伊、伊茲和我們的貓咪藍精靈烏蘇拉，總是在與我們空間中出現的存有們互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "mental bodies 依 terminology.yaml 譯為心智體；貓名保留原文音譯"}

129. I see them watching the beings and seeing things that I can't access in the moment.
→ {"text": "我看到他們注視著這些存有，看到我在當下無法接觸到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Excellent. Well thanks guys, let us know if something pops in here, maybe we'll catch it on film.
→ {"text": "太棒了。好吧謝謝你們，如果有什麼出現就讓我們知道，也許我們能捕捉到畫面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Reuben 的輕鬆語氣"}

131. Well, I guess the last question before we move in is: when you were trying to find labels I guess, or if you weren't even trying but did they present themselves and say I am such and such, I am Pleiadian Collective, I am Calliandra. Is that how it happened or were you able to... how did that come to you, for each? So initially it wasn't that easy. Okay yeah, that's what I figured,
→ {"text": "嗯，我想在我們進入通靈之前最後一個問題是：當你試著找到標籤的時候，或者即使你沒有刻意尋找，他們會自我介紹說我是某某某、我是昴宿星集體、我是卡莉安德拉嗎？是這樣發生的嗎，還是你能夠……這對每個存有來說是如何發生的？所以一開始並不那麼容易。好的是的，我就猜到了，", "confidence": "high", "notes": "對話交錯的自然語氣"}

132. I knew there'd be a story to this. With the Pleiadians it was easy. Immediately I recognized that the transmission from the Pleiadians as a Pleiadian transmission.
→ {"text": "我就知道這背後有故事。昴宿星人的部分很容易。我立刻認出來自昴宿星人的傳訊就是昴宿星的傳訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. I recognized it in my body, in a visceral way. It was very clear to me that's who I was in contact with, and I'd been aware of the Pleiadian energy so my mental body had already accepted the truth of the Pleiadian Collective and their work with us here on Earth. So when they made direct contact with me, my mental body didn't freak out and try to screen out that piece of information, it
→ {"text": "我在身體中認出它，以一種本能的方式。我非常清楚那就是我正在接觸的對象，而且我已經覺察到昴宿星的能量，所以我的心智體已經接受了昴宿星集體的真實性，以及他們在地球上與我們的工作。所以當他們與我直接接觸時，我的心智體沒有驚慌失措，沒有試圖篩選掉那段資訊，它", "confidence": "high", "notes": "句子未完，保留原文結構"}

134. was clear to me. Now many of the other beings that I've worked with, it's taken me some time to kind of work my way into discerning who it was I was connecting with. Now when I say time, I mean perhaps a matter of minutes or hours, yes. It's never been longer than that and that's just I guess part of my operating system.
→ {"text": "對我來說很清楚。現在，對於我合作過的許多其他存有，我需要花一些時間來逐步辨識我正在連結的是誰。當我說時間時，我指的也許是幾分鐘或幾小時的事，是的。從來沒有比這更長，我想那只是我運作系統的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. Calliandra, for instance, when she first made herself known to me, I felt a new being link up with me -- I was preparing for radio interview that night -- I could feel this really wonderful playful presence, and immediately I knew it to be fairy. So again Nora had accepted fairies, that was easy, ah I know this vibration to be fairy. So I asked for a name and I got the name initially Calliana. So I was
→ {"text": "舉例來說，卡莉安德拉第一次讓我知道她的存在時，我感覺到一個新的存有與我連結——那晚我正在準備電台訪談——我能感受到這個非常美妙、充滿玩心的臨在，我立刻知道那是仙子。所以同樣地，諾拉已經接受了仙子的存在，那很容易，啊我認出這個頻率是仙子的。所以我請求一個名字，最初我得到的名字是卡利亞娜（Calliana）。所以我", "confidence": "high", "notes": "vibration 單獨使用譯為頻率，依 terminology.yaml"}

136. playing with Calliana, I was like okay, and I thought no, that's not quite right, and then I got Calliandra -- got it.
→ {"text": "嘗試著卡利亞娜這個名字，我想好吧，然後我覺得不對，不太正確，接著我得到卡莉安德拉——對了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. As soon as I heard, felt, that's really predominantly how I access information when I'm not in the semi-conscious direct voice channeling state, ok? So when Nora is conscious and awake, and when I choose to seek out information as Nora, meaning information I can't just read from a book or you know, I feel it and I hear it. I hear the words. I see it.
→ {"text": "我一聽到、感覺到，那確實是我在不處於半清醒直接聲音通靈狀態時接收資訊的主要方式，好嗎？所以當諾拉是清醒且有意識的，當我選擇以諾拉的身分尋求資訊時，意思是我無法只從書中讀到、或者你知道的那些資訊，我感受到它、聽到它。我聽到文字。我看到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "semi-conscious direct voice channeling 依 terminology.yaml"}

138. I see it sometimes like words on the paper. I see the story. Very occasionally I access more of my clairvoyant abilities, meaning I will see an image, I'll see some light, I'll see a story playing out in my mind's eye. So I felt, heard, the name Calliandra and thought okay her name is Calliandra. And then I had to go outside and ground myself because I was working with a new vibration, a new
→ {"text": "我有時看到它像是紙上的文字。我看到故事。偶爾我會接觸到更多我的靈視能力，意思是我會看到一個影像、看到一些光、看到一個故事在我的心智之眼中展開。所以我感受到、聽到卡莉安德拉這個名字，然後想好吧她的名字是卡莉安德拉。然後我必須走到戶外讓自己接地，因為我正在與一個新的頻率工作，一個新的", "confidence": "high", "notes": "clairvoyant 依 terminology.yaml；mind's eye 譯為心智之眼；vibration 單獨使用譯為頻率"}

139. frequency and I found it actually really powerful and intense to work with a fifth dimensional being. So I was used to working with these very, very high vibrations and high frequencies which were in some ways easier to work with because it's so... well, any of you listening right now, if you just take a breath, you can tune into that light high, high vibration. Imagine it's
→ {"text": "頻率，我發現與第五維度存有工作實際上非常強大且強烈。所以我習慣於與這些非常非常高的振動和高頻率工作，在某些方面它們更容易合作，因為它是如此……嗯，你們現在正在聆聽的任何人，如果你只是深呼吸一下，你就能調頻到那個光、那個高、高的頻率。想像它", "confidence": "high", "notes": "frequency and vibration 並列時保持兩者；fifth dimensional being 依 terminology.yaml"}

140. like interacting with a cloud, yes, gentle easy, right. Calliandra was like interacting with a sledgehammer, her energy was so powerful because she has more density to her vibration as a fifth dimensional being. So I had to go outside and stand on the ground. And then I came in and sat in front of my computer and I thought I'm gonna look up the word Calliandra and see what I find, because I
→ {"text": "像是與雲互動，是的，溫柔、輕鬆，對吧。卡莉安德拉則像是與大槌互動，她的能量如此強大，因為作為第五維度存有，她的頻率具有更多密度。所以我必須走到外面站在地面上。然後我進來坐在電腦前，我想我要查一下卡莉安德拉這個詞，看看我能找到什麼，因為我", "confidence": "high", "notes": "vibration 單獨使用譯為頻率；fifth dimensional being 依 terminology.yaml"}

141. like to also, if I can, back up my other dimensional information with third dimensional information and I googled the word Calliandra, and it's a plant called Fairy Duster and I'd not ever heard that word before and it was such a moment of validation for me, which was great. I was gonna go on the radio that night and introduce a new being, so how wonderful that I got that.
→ {"text": "也喜歡，如果可以的話，用三維資訊來支持我的其他維度資訊，所以我谷歌搜尋了卡莉安德拉這個詞，結果它是一種叫做仙女撣子（朱纓花）的植物，我以前從未聽過這個詞，這對我來說是如此驗證的時刻，太棒了。那晚我要上電台介紹一個新的存有，所以能得到這個驗證真是太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Fairy Duster 依 terminology.yaml 譯為仙女撣子（朱纓花）；third dimensional information 依 terminology.yaml"}

142. So the information you got was Calliandra the fairy and then the validation was caught under the name...
→ {"text": "所以你得到的資訊是卡莉安德拉這個仙子，然後驗證就在這個名字下找到……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. So that took me a couple of hours to answer that question and discerning frequencies and vibrations. Sometimes when I'm working with a client and someone who's passed, connects up with me, you know sometimes I'll feel immediately like oh this is their mother whose passed. And that's work that I don't do a lot of but I do do it occasionally when it's necessary. They will present themselves
→ {"text": "所以那花了我幾個小時來回答這個問題，以及辨識頻率和振動。有時候當我與個案工作，有個已經過世的人與我連結，你知道有時候我會立刻感覺到，噢這是他們過世的母親。那是我不常做的工作，但必要時我偶爾會做。他們會呈現自己", "confidence": "high", "notes": "frequency and vibration 並列時保持兩者"}

144. to me and then typically I'll just ask them questions of the client you know where's your mother is usually how I'll start, as opposed to I've made contact with your mother, because that can be startling for somebody who's lost...
→ {"text": "對我，然後通常我只會問個案問題，你知道「你母親在哪裡」通常是我的開場方式，而不是「我已經與你母親聯繫上了」，因為那對失去親人的人來說可能會很驚嚇……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
