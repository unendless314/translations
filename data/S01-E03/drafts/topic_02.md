→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. Look at your light!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. Look at the beauty in the projection of your light bodies into your physical reality, see yourselves right now as the beautiful beings you are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. Both beings of light, beings holding physical density. Feel your bodies, put your hands on your body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Put your hands somewhere that particularly you don't like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. Alright, find a find a place on your body that you perhaps might not think is so beautiful. Alright, and just breathe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. And connect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. This is your light!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. What you're touching right now is you, your light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. You are love incarnate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. You are nothing else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. All around you is love incarnate, nothing else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. Doesn't matter what it looks like, feels like, the costume it's wearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. Love incarnate, the table, the chair, the ceiling, the walls, the air, the atmosphere, the Republican, the Democrat, the Illuminati.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. Yeshua, us, you, love incarnate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Love playing a game. That's all this is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. And that's all there is to the idea of awakening from within.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. And as we look at all of you, what we see: all of you here in this room, all of you listening in, all of you tuning in at a later date, is you're already awake.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. Right?  Who in the room feels awake?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. And yet you continue to awaken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. Because this is the game.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. You wake up, you remember right? You all remember that? Yes, remember when you woke up? Everyone here had some sort of an awakening moment. It may have been very small. It may have been gigantic. It really doesn't matter, every single one of you at some point came in awake, went back to sleep, because that's what happened, for all of you. Most of the children coming in now, they don't have to go through this, you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. They're not going back to sleep as you all did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. Sometimes they take little naps, alright?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. They forget for a bit of time who they are and then it's very easy for them to wake themselves up and remember. But you all, you came into an incredibly dense environment awake and then went back to sleep because that was the game plan. That's the program. You weren't supposed to remember throughout the totality of this incarnation that you are love incarnate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. You were supposed to come in, forget that, throw on a costume, create a whole bunch of drama for yourselves, work through a myriad of issues, traumas, most of which have nothing to do with this incarnation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Alright so think about that piece right now. Anytime you've given yourself something to work on in this lifetime, what you've also been doing and the main reason you gave yourselves those things to work on, is you've been clearing up with yourselves all of these unhealed traumas from all of these other lifetimes, that didn't happen in the past, that are happening right now, because all is now, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. Every version of you that you see is a past life version of you, is truly existing right now in a moment in time, currently experiencing whatever pain, whatever loss, whatever grief, whatever anger, whatever hurt, whatever anguish, etc. And throughout this incarnation you have picked up again and again and again and again these pieces of your oversoul that are sitting in distress. You have interacted with them,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. sent them transmissions of unconditional love as you have worked on your own stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. And suddenly you find yourself then to be a much more powerful, clear, and sovereign being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
