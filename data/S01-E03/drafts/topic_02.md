46. Love playing a game. That's all this is.
→ {"text": "愛在玩一場遊戲。這就是一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. And that's all there is to the idea of awakening from within.
→ {"text": "這就是從內在覺醒這個概念的全部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. And as we look at all of you, what we see: all of you here in this room, all of you listening in, all of you tuning in at a later date, is you're already awake.
→ {"text": "當我們看著你們所有人時，我們看到的是：你們所有在這個房間裡的人、所有正在聆聽的人、所有在之後收看的人，你們已經覺醒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Right?  Who in the room feels awake?
→ {"text": "對吧？房間裡誰感覺自己是覺醒的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. And yet you continue to awaken.
→ {"text": "然而你們仍在持續覺醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Because this is the game.
→ {"text": "因為這就是遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. You wake up, you remember right? You all remember that? Yes, remember when you woke up? Everyone here had some sort of an awakening moment. It may have been very small. It may have been gigantic. It really doesn't matter, every single one of you at some point came in awake, went back to sleep, because that's what happened, for all of you. Most of the children coming in now, they don't have to go through this, you know.
→ {"text": "你們醒來了，你們記得對吧？你們都記得嗎？是的，記得你們醒來的時候嗎？在場的每個人都有過某種覺醒時刻。它可能非常小，也可能非常巨大。這真的不重要，你們每一個人在某個時刻都是覺醒著來到這裡的，然後又回去睡覺了，因為這就是發生的事，對你們所有人都是如此。現在進來的大多數孩子，你知道，他們不需要經歷這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. They're not going back to sleep as you all did.
→ {"text": "他們不會像你們所有人那樣回去睡覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. Sometimes they take little naps, alright?
→ {"text": "有時他們會小睡一下，好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. They forget for a bit of time who they are and then it's very easy for them to wake themselves up and remember. But you all, you came into an incredibly dense environment awake and then went back to sleep because that was the game plan. That's the program. You weren't supposed to remember throughout the totality of this incarnation that you are love incarnate.
→ {"text": "他們會暫時忘記自己是誰，然後很容易就能喚醒自己並記起來。但你們所有人，你們是在一個極度稠密的環境中覺醒著來的，然後又回去睡覺了，因為那就是遊戲計畫。那就是程式。在這個轉世的全程中，你們本來就不應該記得你們是愛的化身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. You were supposed to come in, forget that, throw on a costume, create a whole bunch of drama for yourselves, work through a myriad of issues, traumas, most of which have nothing to do with this incarnation.
→ {"text": "你們本來就應該進來、忘記這一點、穿上一件外衣、為自己創造一堆戲劇、處理無數的議題和創傷，其中大部分與這個轉世無關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. Alright so think about that piece right now. Anytime you've given yourself something to work on in this lifetime, what you've also been doing and the main reason you gave yourselves those things to work on, is you've been clearing up with yourselves all of these unhealed traumas from all of these other lifetimes, that didn't happen in the past, that are happening right now, because all is now, right?
→ {"text": "好的，現在想想這一點。每當你們在這一生中給自己一些東西去處理時，你們同時在做的、也是你們給自己這些東西去處理的主要原因，是你們一直在清理所有這些其他生世中未療癒的創傷，它們不是發生在過去，而是正在此刻發生，因為一切都是當下，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. Every version of you that you see is a past life version of you, is truly existing right now in a moment in time, currently experiencing whatever pain, whatever loss, whatever grief, whatever anger, whatever hurt, whatever anguish, etc. And throughout this incarnation you have picked up again and again and again and again these pieces of your oversoul that are sitting in distress. You have interacted with them,
→ {"text": "你們看到的每一個版本的自己，都是你們過去生世的版本，都真實地存在於此刻的某個時間點中，無論正在經歷著痛苦、失落、悲傷、憤怒、傷害，等等。在這轉世的過程中，你們一而再再而三地撿起了這些處於困境中的超靈碎片。你們與它們互動，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. sent them transmissions of unconditional love as you have worked on your own stuff.
→ {"text": "在處理你們自己的東西時，向它們傳送無條件的愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. And suddenly you find yourself then to be a much more powerful, clear, and sovereign being.
→ {"text": "然後突然之間，你們發現自己成為一個更加強大、清晰且自主的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
