## Speaker Group 1

1. So I'm Nora Herold. I know a lot of you are familiar with my work. For those of you who are meeting me for the first time, I've been channeling consciously for about 20 years.

2. Um, but for all of my life, I was hearing things and feeling things and seeing things and knowing things and I didn't have a context for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. I didn't understand it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. Oftentimes it felt distracting and overwhelming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. I didn't really understand that it could be an experience that would support or contribute to my reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. And then in 1996 I found myself in a ball on the floor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. At the age of 29 years old, going through my Saturn return, my first Saturn return.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. And I was depressed and had gone through a very dramatic breakup and felt brokenhearted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. And you know the beautiful thing about heartbreak is it opens us all up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. And in that very open space I was hanging out with a dear friend one night who read tarot cards as I also read tarot cards.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. I'd read tarot cards for years. I'd played with crystals. You know, I'd started to tune in consciously at about the age of 20.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. She mentions that she had met a woman recently who channeled her spirit guides.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. And that woman was Wendy Kennedy. So this is back in Chicago back in 1996. And I said oh I think that's what I'm looking for. And why don't we try? And she said great, I've been trying and she'd had some luck, feeling something. But when the two of us sat down together that night with the intention to connect it happened almost immediately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. I felt the presence of a being that was so loving, so calming, and so nurturing to me. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced as Nora before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. And it was very quick moment. I felt his love. I felt his energy as male and I knew his name started with an M.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. And then the tube on Amy's television blew out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. As Amy was also having her own connection experience. And then very shortly afterwards, she and I got together with Wendy, and that was my first meeting with Wendy Kennedy. And Wendy, Amy, and I channeled together for play, for fun, for quite some time. That was how we spent our evenings was hanging out channeling for each other, channeling for our friends, you know, we didn't go to bars and get drunk. We stayed in my apartment, my little basement apartment in Chicago and ate cookies and channeled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. And then at some point it became clear that this was the service work that I was here to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. So it is now what I do. It's what I've done for a very long time and my work has evolved over the years. I channel many different beings. The Pleiadian Collective is primary right now in my channeling work and then Yeshua and Calliandra are close behind, and then behind them the Lyrans and the archangels and all the other beings. And so many beings participate when we channel, you know, it's funny, you know listening to Shelley bring through Gabriel and I could feel all the other energies braiding in
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. and working through her as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. It's true for everyone I listened to yesterday, so the same will happen today. What I recommend for all of you is that you really... allow yourselves to recognize your own experience of channeling while I'm channeling today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. Because to be able to receive channeled information in any format means that your channeling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. Doesn't matter that's coming out of my mouth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. You're acting as the receivers for the information as well. Okay, I'm going to sit down now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. I'm gonna straighten myself out here. How's my hair? Okay. Now now Nora will quiet down. I'll tell you that when I channel. I'm very present.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. So you may hear from me again during the channeling portion. Okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. (Oming sounds) Ahhhhh.....
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. Fantastic!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
