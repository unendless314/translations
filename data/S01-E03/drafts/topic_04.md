## Speaker Group 1

86. The beings I work with are the Pleiadian Collective. So they're a twelfth dimensional collective of beings that, if we were going to assign them a location in our third dimensional version of reality -- Twelfth dimension - how do you even have that? I mean that's even so far out of Earthly terms, but...

87. It's different experience, different flavors along with that comes different abilities, different awareness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. So when I say twelfth dimensional Pleiadian Collective - they are a gigantic being of love and light, that knows themselves to be one, and yet understands that they are comprised of many ones, but they do not each individuate themselves like we do here on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. Hence the term 'collective'. So it's not a specific being in particular.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. That's correct, but there are specific beings I work with as well. So the Pleiadians are one of many groups and beings I work with. A specific being would be Calliandra, she's a fifth dimensional fairy, so we'll call her a fairy, that's how she presented herself to me. I also work with Yeshua.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. I see Yeshua to be a collective being, but we know that being to be an individual entity that we call Jesus on this planet. But I know that energy to be a collective energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Or the Archangel Michael at times will come through me, the Lyrans, beings from Lemuria, the Zeta's have made contact with me. It's a very in-the-moment process for me, but the majority of the information I'm accessing at this time is coming from the Pleiadians, Yeshua, and Calliandra, those are kind of the big three for me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. And are you, you're present in your awareness when this happens, it's not like you conk out and then and then you wake up and I go, what happened? I've seen that, I've seen people who have channeled and that's taking place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. Yes, so what you're talking about there is trance channeling. Trance channeling? Yes. What I do is called conscious channeling and/or semi-conscious channeling. And you can even see a difference in me when I'm fully conscious and then when I'm semi-conscious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. So has that happened to you in the past?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Yes. So the fully conscious channeling is more that, okay, I'm accessing the information, I'm gonna give it to you right now: Reuben, they're telling me: blah blah blah blah blah blah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. So that's almost like, when you work with clients -- Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. Hearing it and kind of translating it -- And then I will go into a semi-conscious state with clients as well where then I allow the Pleiadians, Yeshua, whomever in the moment to directly work through my body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. Is there...you must resonate with all the different frequencies otherwise they wouldn't be coming through. Do you have a favorite?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. Or can you not say?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. Do I have a favorite? Depends on the day?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. Yeah, it's really, it's the Pleiadians, Calliandra, and Yeshua. I could not pick one of those out of the three.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. However, I'm aware that I have a very specific contract with the Pleiadians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. And I believe that's why they're predominantly coming through right now and I've really noticed that over the last year especially when I go into the semi-conscious direct voice channeling state, it's mostly the Pleiadians transmitting and then occasionally Yeshua, Calliandra, the others, the Lyrans, Lemurians. In the past there used to be more of a variety in my work, so I'm
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. very aware that for now, maybe we'll say the Pleiadians are my favorite.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. Sorry, Calliandra. Sure she understands. Oh she understands, but she's like this right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. Well, maybe we can give her some time to voice as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. Well, in addition to being a channeler, or maybe this goes hand in hand, because you're also clairvoyant or a clairaudient or is that kind of one and the same?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. So language is very interesting because we use it to help us understand and label and then we can often then limit and categorize.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. Channels will use their clairvoyant, their clairaudient, they're clairsentient abilities to help them access information. Yes, I am also as Nora however, very intuitive, psychic, clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. That's a little bit different from channeling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Yes, that's me using my own operating system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. So and you have those abilities as well. Awesome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. Because I've talked with other, I guess, intuitive people, in quotes, where to me and after hearing the process, it sounds like they were just tapping into like more channel type you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Well, it wasn't me, it was I heard a voice and this is this is what I'm getting, and you know, most the time it's accurate so.. But I just wondered how your operating system works?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. Yes, and really when it comes down to it, it's all information coming from source energy. Whether you access it directly in your own body or you access it from a vibration or a frequency outside of you. We are all source, we are all that love energy incarnate. It's just fun to get to do it different ways. That's one of the gifts of being here on planet Earth, we get the
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. variety and the selection.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. And you know and yeah getting to that and maybe this is a question later for the Pleiadians, but by giving it these labels, is that just more because I've noticed some people who are new to the intuitive side of things they're feeling energies, they're hearing it, but they don't, maybe they don't know how to categorize them right or is it even appropriate to categorize it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. How does that, you know how does that all-- when ultimately we're trying to get to a place where we're not labeling anything at all. How does that help us and does that serve us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. I think it helps initially to label, categorize, to help the mental body catch up and understand what it is you're already doing in your emotional and energetic and physical bodies and then once you achieve that level of understanding, it's very important to release the labels and the attachments and just be in the moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. Because then your mind has relaxed. So the mental body was really set up to filter out the third dimensional mental body. Was set up to filter out all of this input, all of this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
