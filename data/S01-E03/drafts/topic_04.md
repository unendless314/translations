## Speaker Group 1

86. The beings I work with are the Pleiadian Collective. So they're a twelfth dimensional collective of beings that, if we were going to assign them a location in our third dimensional version of reality -- Twelfth dimension - how do you even have that? I mean that's even so far out of Earthly terms, but...
→ {"text": "我工作的存有是昴宿星集體。所以他們是一個第十二維度的集體存有，如果我們要給他們在我們第三維度版本的實相中指定一個位置的話——第十二維度——你怎麼可能理解那是什麼？我的意思是，這甚至遠遠超出地球的概念，但……", "confidence": "high", "notes": "twelfth dimensional 依 terminology.yaml"}

87. It's different experience, different flavors along with that comes different abilities, different awareness.
→ {"text": "那是不同的體驗，不同的風味，伴隨而來的是不同的能力、不同的覺知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. So when I say twelfth dimensional Pleiadian Collective - they are a gigantic being of love and light, that knows themselves to be one, and yet understands that they are comprised of many ones, but they do not each individuate themselves like we do here on Earth.
→ {"text": "所以當我說第十二維度的昴宿星集體時——他們是一個巨大的愛與光的存有，知道自己是一體的，但也理解他們是由許多個體組成的，只是他們不像我們在地球上這樣將自己個體化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. Hence the term 'collective'. So it's not a specific being in particular.
→ {"text": "因此才稱為「集體」。所以這不是一個特定的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. That's correct, but there are specific beings I work with as well. So the Pleiadians are one of many groups and beings I work with. A specific being would be Calliandra, she's a fifth dimensional fairy, so we'll call her a fairy, that's how she presented herself to me. I also work with Yeshua.
→ {"text": "沒錯，但我也會與一些特定的存有工作。所以昴宿星人是我工作的眾多團體和存有之一。一個特定的存有是卡莉安德拉（Calliandra），她是一個第五維度仙子，所以我們稱她為仙子，這就是她向我呈現自己的方式。我也與耶書亞（Yeshua）工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "專有名詞首次出現使用中英對照"}

91. I see Yeshua to be a collective being, but we know that being to be an individual entity that we call Jesus on this planet. But I know that energy to be a collective energy.
→ {"text": "我認為耶書亞是一個集體存有，但我們在這個星球上知道那個存有是一個個體實體，我們稱之為耶穌。但我知道那個能量是一個集體能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. Or the Archangel Michael at times will come through me, the Lyrans, beings from Lemuria, the Zeta's have made contact with me. It's a very in-the-moment process for me, but the majority of the information I'm accessing at this time is coming from the Pleiadians, Yeshua, and Calliandra, those are kind of the big three for me.
→ {"text": "或者有時候大天使麥可會透過我傳訊，還有天琴座人、來自雷姆利亞的存有，齊塔人也曾與我接觸。對我來說這是一個非常當下的過程，但此時我接收的大部分資訊都來自昴宿星人、耶書亞和卡莉安德拉，這是我的三大主要存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. And are you, you're present in your awareness when this happens, it's not like you conk out and then and then you wake up and I go, what happened? I've seen that, I've seen people who have channeled and that's taking place.
→ {"text": "那你呢，當這發生的時候你保持著覺知嗎？不會像你昏過去然後醒來說，發生什麼了？我見過那種情況，我見過有些人通靈時就是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. Yes, so what you're talking about there is trance channeling. Trance channeling? Yes. What I do is called conscious channeling and/or semi-conscious channeling. And you can even see a difference in me when I'm fully conscious and then when I'm semi-conscious.
→ {"text": "是的，所以你說的那種是出神通靈。出神通靈？對。我做的叫做清醒通靈和/或半清醒通靈。你甚至可以看到我在完全清醒狀態和半清醒狀態時的區別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "trance/conscious/semi-conscious channeling 依 terminology.yaml"}

95. So has that happened to you in the past?
→ {"text": "那你過去有過那種經驗嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. Yes. So the fully conscious channeling is more that, okay, I'm accessing the information, I'm gonna give it to you right now: Reuben, they're telling me: blah blah blah blah blah blah.
→ {"text": "有的。所以完全清醒通靈更像是，好的，我正在接收資訊，我現在就要告訴你：魯本，他們告訴我：巴拉巴拉巴拉巴拉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. So that's almost like, when you work with clients -- Yes.
→ {"text": "所以那幾乎就像，當你跟個案工作時——對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. Hearing it and kind of translating it -- And then I will go into a semi-conscious state with clients as well where then I allow the Pleiadians, Yeshua, whomever in the moment to directly work through my body.
→ {"text": "聽到它然後某種程度上翻譯它——然後我也會在個案工作中進入半清醒狀態，讓昴宿星人、耶書亞、或當下的任何存有直接透過我的身體工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. Is there...you must resonate with all the different frequencies otherwise they wouldn't be coming through. Do you have a favorite?
→ {"text": "有沒有……你一定與所有這些不同的頻率共振，否則他們不會透過你傳訊。你有最喜歡的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. Or can you not say?
→ {"text": "還是你不能說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. Do I have a favorite? Depends on the day?
→ {"text": "我有最喜歡的嗎？要看是哪一天？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. Yeah, it's really, it's the Pleiadians, Calliandra, and Yeshua. I could not pick one of those out of the three.
→ {"text": "是的，其實就是昴宿星人、卡莉安德拉和耶書亞。我無法從這三個中選出一個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. However, I'm aware that I have a very specific contract with the Pleiadians.
→ {"text": "但是，我知道我與昴宿星人有一個非常特定的契約。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. And I believe that's why they're predominantly coming through right now and I've really noticed that over the last year especially when I go into the semi-conscious direct voice channeling state, it's mostly the Pleiadians transmitting and then occasionally Yeshua, Calliandra, the others, the Lyrans, Lemurians. In the past there used to be more of a variety in my work, so I'm
→ {"text": "我相信這就是為什麼他們現在主要通過我傳訊，我真的注意到在過去一年，特別是當我進入半清醒的直接聲音通靈狀態時，大部分是昴宿星人在傳訊，然後偶爾是耶書亞、卡莉安德拉、其他存有、天琴座人、雷姆利亞人。過去在我的工作中曾經有更多樣化的存有，所以我", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. very aware that for now, maybe we'll say the Pleiadians are my favorite.
→ {"text": "非常清楚，也許我們可以說，目前昴宿星人是我的最愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. Sorry, Calliandra. Sure she understands. Oh she understands, but she's like this right now.
→ {"text": "抱歉，卡莉安德拉。她肯定理解的。噢，她理解，但她現在就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. Well, maybe we can give her some time to voice as well.
→ {"text": "嗯，也許我們也可以給她一些時間發聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. Well, in addition to being a channeler, or maybe this goes hand in hand, because you're also clairvoyant or a clairaudient or is that kind of one and the same?
→ {"text": "嗯，除了是一個通靈者，或者這些是相輔相成的，因為你也是靈視者或靈聽者，還是說那些是同一回事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. So language is very interesting because we use it to help us understand and label and then we can often then limit and categorize.
→ {"text": "所以語言非常有趣，因為我們用它來幫助我們理解和標籤，然後我們又常常會因此限制和分類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. Channels will use their clairvoyant, their clairaudient, they're clairsentient abilities to help them access information. Yes, I am also as Nora however, very intuitive, psychic, clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient.
→ {"text": "通靈管道會使用他們的靈視、靈聽、靈感能力來幫助他們接收資訊。是的，作為諾拉的我也非常直覺、通靈、靈視、靈聽、靈感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. That's a little bit different from channeling.
→ {"text": "這與通靈有一點不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. Yes, that's me using my own operating system.
→ {"text": "是的，那是我在使用我自己的操作系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. So and you have those abilities as well. Awesome.
→ {"text": "所以你也有那些能力。真棒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. Because I've talked with other, I guess, intuitive people, in quotes, where to me and after hearing the process, it sounds like they were just tapping into like more channel type you know.
→ {"text": "因為我跟其他，我想，所謂的直覺者聊過，對我來說，在聽完他們的過程後，聽起來他們只是在接入像是更多通靈管道的類型，你知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. Well, it wasn't me, it was I heard a voice and this is this is what I'm getting, and you know, most the time it's accurate so.. But I just wondered how your operating system works?
→ {"text": "嗯，那不是我，是我聽到一個聲音，這就是我得到的，你知道，大部分時候都很準確，所以……但我只是好奇你的操作系統是如何運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. Yes, and really when it comes down to it, it's all information coming from source energy. Whether you access it directly in your own body or you access it from a vibration or a frequency outside of you. We are all source, we are all that love energy incarnate. It's just fun to get to do it different ways. That's one of the gifts of being here on planet Earth, we get the
→ {"text": "是的，真的說到底，這都是來自源頭能量的資訊。無論你是直接在自己身體內接收它，還是從你之外的振動或頻率中接收它。我們都是源頭，我們都是那個愛的能量化身。只是能用不同方式做這件事很有趣。這是在地球上的禮物之一，我們得到了", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. variety and the selection.
→ {"text": "多樣性和選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. And you know and yeah getting to that and maybe this is a question later for the Pleiadians, but by giving it these labels, is that just more because I've noticed some people who are new to the intuitive side of things they're feeling energies, they're hearing it, but they don't, maybe they don't know how to categorize them right or is it even appropriate to categorize it?
→ {"text": "你知道，說到這點，也許這是稍後要問昴宿星人的問題，但給它這些標籤，是不是更多是因為我注意到一些剛接觸直覺這一面的人，他們感受到能量、聽到它，但他們不，也許他們不知道如何正確地分類它們，或者說分類它是否恰當？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. How does that, you know how does that all-- when ultimately we're trying to get to a place where we're not labeling anything at all. How does that help us and does that serve us?
→ {"text": "那如何，你知道那一切如何——當我們最終試圖到達一個完全不貼標籤的地方時。這如何幫助我們，這對我們有用嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. I think it helps initially to label, categorize, to help the mental body catch up and understand what it is you're already doing in your emotional and energetic and physical bodies and then once you achieve that level of understanding, it's very important to release the labels and the attachments and just be in the moment.
→ {"text": "我認為最初標籤化、分類化有幫助，能幫助心智體跟上並理解你在情緒體、能量體和物質體中已經在做的事，然後一旦你達到那個理解層次，釋放標籤和執著並只是活在當下就非常重要了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. Because then your mind has relaxed. So the mental body was really set up to filter out the third dimensional mental body. Was set up to filter out all of this input, all of this information.
→ {"text": "因為那時你的心智已經放鬆了。所以心智體真的是被設定來過濾的，第三維度的心智體。被設定來過濾掉所有這些輸入、所有這些資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
