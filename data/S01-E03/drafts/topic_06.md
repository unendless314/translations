145. But how about so-called dark energies or even manipulating tricksters or these kinds of, you know, what we see typically in the movies...
→ {"text": "但那些所謂的黑暗能量，或甚至是操控人的干擾靈體，還有這些，你知道的，我們在電影裡常看到的那些東西呢⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. Actually this whole experience, you know, channeling, has kind of been made quite negative in our media and with you know, like "The Exorcist" and these kinds of things. So I've interacted especially when I first started channeling, had a couple of interactions with energies that felt, that seemed to be wanting to guide, and seemed to be wanting to give information and so initially it
→ {"text": "其實整個通靈這件事，你知道，在我們的媒體中被描繪得相當負面，像是《大法師》之類的東西。所以我在剛開始通靈的時候，尤其是那時候，有過幾次與能量互動的經驗，它們感覺起來、看起來似乎想要引導，似乎想要給予資訊，所以一開始", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. was interesting and then, what I found happening was I started feeling afraid.
→ {"text": "還蠻有趣的，但後來，我發現發生的事情是，我開始感到害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. Not of the being itself but of the information they were giving me, it was causing me to feel afraid. Afraid that I wasn't going to have what I wanted in my life, afraid that I wasn't really powerful. So that's.. then I become aware, oh I'm accessing another vibrational energy that I don't want to be playing with. And then I would just.. And that's how you could kind of discern
→ {"text": "不是害怕那個存有本身，而是它們給我的資訊，讓我感到害怕。害怕我無法在生命中擁有我想要的東西，害怕我其實並不強大。所以那就是⋯⋯然後我就意識到，噢，我正在連接另一個我不想與之互動的頻率能量。然後我就會⋯⋯這就是你可以辨識的方式", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. which energy is there, just if it's doing some..., if it's putting you in a fear-based state. If you're accessing an energy and you start to feel bad in your body, it's not really an energy you want to be playing with. So the thing to do then is to just send a big transmission of unconditional love to that being, and raise your own vibration. That clears the being out of
→ {"text": "——辨識那是什麼能量，就看它是否在做某些事⋯⋯，是否讓你進入一個恐懼狀態。如果你正在連接一個能量，然後你開始在身體裡感覺不舒服，那真的不是你想要與之互動的能量。所以這時候要做的就是，向那個存有發送一個強大的無條件的愛的傳送，並提升你自己的頻率。那會清除你空間中的那個存有", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. your space, it raises your energy. Then you're able to reconnect with those higher vibrational beings, and then you can always - as well, if you're already channeling, so if you're familiar with the process, you can call on a being that you know to be of a higher vibrational nature that you're familiar with, to kind of reconnect, solidify those connections.
→ {"text": "，那會提升你的能量。然後你就能夠重新連結那些更高頻率的存有，而且你也總是可以——還有，如果你已經在通靈了，所以如果你熟悉這個過程，你可以呼喚一個你知道是更高頻率本質的、你熟悉的存有，來重新連結、鞏固那些連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. I've heard of cases where energies start out good, it's almost like almost like the church, you know start out good, with good love and light messages and get people in and then somewhere down the path the message can kind of turn and then start putting people in a fear-based situation and then usually after they get a bunch of people kind of already in, and you know
→ {"text": "我聽說過一些案例，能量一開始是好的，就幾乎像⋯⋯幾乎像教會，你知道，一開始是好的，帶著美好的愛與光的訊息把人們吸引進來，然後在某個時候，訊息可能開始轉變，然後開始讓人們進入一個恐懼狀態，通常是在他們已經吸引了一群人進來之後，你知道", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. very much like a church type scenario.
→ {"text": "非常像是教會類型的情境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. Well the other issue that you're touching on here is, you know as a channel, you still have an ego. So often what will happen is, in those situations, the energy itself stays in that high vibrational state - it's the filter that alters, meaning the channel.
→ {"text": "嗯，你這裡觸及的另一個問題是，你知道，作為一個通靈管道，你仍然有小我。所以經常會發生的是，在那些情況中，能量本身保持在那個高頻率狀態——是濾鏡改變了，也就是通靈者的濾鏡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. So I'm constantly checking my filter. I'm constantly having to disengage from any personal intention or attachment to anything personally for Nora, while channeling, or the person I'm channeling for. So if I were channeling for you, Reuben, in a private session and I had a particular desire for you, for your success let's say? If I was attached to that, that would cloud my ability to
→ {"text": "所以我不斷地檢查我的濾鏡。我必須不斷地脫離任何個人意圖或執著——在通靈時，對諾拉個人的任何事情，或對我正在為之通靈的那個人的任何執著。所以如果我在為你通靈，魯本，在一個私人療程中，而我對你有特定的渴望，比如說，渴望你成功?如果我執著於那個，那會模糊我清楚辨識", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. clearly discern the information that's coming through and I'd put my own spin on it.
→ {"text": "的能力——辨識正在傳來的資訊，而我會把我自己的詮釋加進去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. So what you're talking about I think are those cults that have come up around channels and things like that, it's, you know, there's an imperative underneath that the channel was running for a prosperity issue or relationship issue or sexual issue or whatever it is.
→ {"text": "所以我認為你說的是那些圍繞著通靈管道出現的邪教之類的，你知道，底層有一個強迫性驅力，通靈者正在為某個繁榮議題、關係議題、性議題或任何其他議題而運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. And suddenly 'the being' is recommending everyone hand over their money, when really, it's the channel speaking and the being has no control over that.
→ {"text": "然後突然「那個存有」開始建議大家交出他們的錢，但實際上，那是通靈者在說話，而那個存有對此無法控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. So that's the other wonderful thing about this co-creative work in channeling.
→ {"text": "所以這就是通靈中這個共同創造工作的另一個美妙之處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. I can only bring through what I allow myself to bring through. They can't force me to do anything. So I can alter the message, really, any time I want.
→ {"text": "我只能傳遞我允許自己傳遞的東西。他們不能強迫我做任何事。所以我可以改變訊息，真的，任何時候我想要的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. You really have to keep yourself in check though?
→ {"text": "不過你真的必須一直檢視自己，對吧?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. Yeah - and I have a lot of lessons that I've experienced in this lifetime to remind me to keep myself in check.
→ {"text": "是的——而且我在這一生中經歷了很多課題，提醒我要保持檢視自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. I'm sure they're guiding and helping you do that.
→ {"text": "我相信他們正在引導和幫助你做到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "是的，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. As long as you're paying attention.
→ {"text": "只要你保持注意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. And I guess when those others, that we talked about, probably aren't paying attention or you know they're not, I'm sure those higher beings are probably screaming at them and then the ego kicks in and tunes them out.
→ {"text": "而且我猜當那些其他人，我們談到的那些，可能沒有保持注意，或者你知道他們沒有，我確信那些更高的存有可能正在對他們大喊，然後小我就跳進來把他們屏蔽掉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. I think those things happen for karmic reasons or because they've got trauma they haven't resolved, and that trauma begins to spin this tale.
→ {"text": "我認為那些事情發生是因為業力原因，或者因為他們有未解決的創傷，而那個創傷開始編織這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. But the other thing you've got to look at here is anybody who gets pulled in by something like that, they are a co-creator in that experience as well.
→ {"text": "但你在這裡必須看到的另一件事是，任何被這樣的事物吸引進去的人，他們也是那個經驗的共同創造者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. They are willingly handing over their free will to that entity or that higher being and that's their lesson as well. So then the channel who's bringing through the information in that way with their own, perhaps, distorted filter is suddenly serving to offer this lesson to anybody who wants to hand over their free will and forget they're sovereign.
→ {"text": "他們是自願地把他們的自由意志交給那個實體或那個更高的存有，而那也是他們的課題。所以那時候，那個用自己的、或許是扭曲的濾鏡來傳遞資訊的通靈管道，突然間就是在為任何想要交出他們的自由意志、忘記自己是自主的人，提供這個課題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Man, so many people hand over that free will so easily.
→ {"text": "天啊，那麼多人如此輕易地就交出那個自由意志。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. Well, we're also programmed to be enslaved, so we really...
→ {"text": "嗯，我們也被編程為被奴役的，所以我們真的……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. Is that a DNA programming, you think, or is that..?
→ {"text": "你認為那是 DNA 編程嗎，還是……？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. It's in our genetic code and it's something that we're in the process of rewriting as we integrate our higher selves because our higher selves don't have that imperative to run the enslavement games.
→ {"text": "這在我們的基因編碼中，而這是我們正在重寫的東西，當我們整合我們的高我時，因為我們的高我沒有那個要運作奴役遊戲的強迫性驅力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. They don't have genetics, do they?
→ {"text": "他們沒有基因，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. Well, they don't but, as we're integrating our higher selves into our third dimensional chakra system, our higher selves are interacting with our physical genetic structure.  Now I'm a bit going into the channeling state, so I'm not fully direct voice channeling, but if you're paying attention to me you're going to see I look a little different right now because my eyes are starting
→ {"text": "嗯，他們沒有，但當我們正在將我們的高我整合進我們的三維脈輪系統時，我們的高我正在與我們的物質基因結構互動。現在我有點要進入通靈狀態了，所以我還不是完全在直接聲音通靈，但如果你注意看我，你會看到我現在看起來有點不同，因為我的眼睛開始", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Nora 開始進入通靈狀態的關鍵轉換時刻"}

175. to get a, have a different focus, so the Pleiadians are just reminding us right now that as we integrate our higher selves we are altering ourselves from the inside out physically, genetically as well and we're breaking down... Greetings!
→ {"text": "有一個不同的焦點，所以昴宿星人現在正在提醒我們，當我們整合我們的高我時，我們正在從內到外改變我們自己，在物質上、在基因上也是如此，而且我們正在打破……你們好！", "confidence": "high", "notes": "昴宿星集體開始說話的時刻"}

176. This is the Pleiadians Collective as always, it's wonderful to have the opportunity to link up with you in this way, and we'll give you back Nora if you need her again? No this is a good transition.
→ {"text": "我們是昴宿星集體，一如既往，能有機會以這種方式與你們連結是如此美好，如果你們再次需要諾拉，我們會把她還給你們？不，這是個很好的轉換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
