## Speaker Group 1

145. But how about so-called dark energies or even manipulating tricksters or these kinds of, you know, what we see typically in the movies...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. Actually this whole experience, you know, channeling, has kind of been made quite negative in our media and with you know, like "The Exorcist" and these kinds of things. So I've interacted especially when I first started channeling, had a couple of interactions with energies that felt, that seemed to be wanting to guide, and seemed to be wanting to give information and so initially it
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. was interesting and then, what I found happening was I started feeling afraid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Not of the being itself but of the information they were giving me, it was causing me to feel afraid. Afraid that I wasn't going to have what I wanted in my life, afraid that I wasn't really powerful. So that's.. then I become aware, oh I'm accessing another vibrational energy that I don't want to be playing with. And then I would just.. And that's how you could kind of discern
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. which energy is there, just if it's doing some..., if it's putting you in a fear-based state. If you're accessing an energy and you start to feel bad in your body, it's not really an energy you want to be playing with. So the thing to do then is to just send a big transmission of unconditional love to that being, and raise your own vibration. That clears the being out of
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. your space, it raises your energy. Then you're able to reconnect with those higher vibrational beings, and then you can always - as well, if you're already channeling, so if you're familiar with the process, you can call on a being that you know to be of a higher vibrational nature that you're familiar with, to kind of reconnect, solidify those connections.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. I've heard of cases where energies start out good, it's almost like almost like the church, you know start out good, with good love and light messages and get people in and then somewhere down the path the message can kind of turn and then start putting people in a fear-based situation and then usually after they get a bunch of people kind of already in, and you know
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. very much like a church type scenario.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. Well the other issue that you're touching on here is, you know as a channel, you still have an ego. So often what will happen is, in those situations, the energy itself stays in that high vibrational state - it's the filter that alters, meaning the channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. So I'm constantly checking my filter. I'm constantly having to disengage from any personal intention or attachment to anything personally for Nora, while channeling, or the person I'm channeling for. So if I were channeling for you, Reuben, in a private session and I had a particular desire for you, for your success let's say? If I was attached to that, that would cloud my ability to
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. clearly discern the information that's coming through and I'd put my own spin on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. So what you're talking about I think are those cults that have come up around channels and things like that, it's, you know, there's an imperative underneath that the channel was running for a prosperity issue or relationship issue or sexual issue or whatever it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. And suddenly 'the being' is recommending everyone hand over their money, when really, it's the channel speaking and the being has no control over that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. So that's the other wonderful thing about this co-creative work in channeling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. I can only bring through what I allow myself to bring through. They can't force me to do anything. So I can alter the message, really, any time I want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. You really have to keep yourself in check though?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Yeah - and I have a lot of lessons that I've experienced in this lifetime to remind me to keep myself in check.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. I'm sure they're guiding and helping you do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. As long as you're paying attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. And I guess when those others, that we talked about, probably aren't paying attention or you know they're not, I'm sure those higher beings are probably screaming at them and then the ego kicks in and tunes them out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. I think those things happen for karmic reasons or because they've got trauma they haven't resolved, and that trauma begins to spin this tale.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. But the other thing you've got to look at here is anybody who gets pulled in by something like that, they are a co-creator in that experience as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. They are willingly handing over their free will to that entity or that higher being and that's their lesson as well. So then the channel who's bringing through the information in that way with their own, perhaps, distorted filter is suddenly serving to offer this lesson to anybody who wants to hand over their free will and forget they're sovereign.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Man, so many people hand over that free will so easily.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Well, we're also programmed to be enslaved, so we really...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Is that a DNA programming, you think, or is that..?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. It's in our genetic code and it's something that we're in the process of rewriting as we integrate our higher selves because our higher selves don't have that imperative to run the enslavement games.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. They don't have genetics, do they?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Well, they don't but, as we're integrating our higher selves into our third dimensional chakra system, our higher selves are interacting with our physical genetic structure.  Now I'm a bit going into the channeling state, so I'm not fully direct voice channeling, but if you're paying attention to me you're going to see I look a little different right now because my eyes are starting
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. to get a, have a different focus, so the Pleiadians are just reminding us right now that as we integrate our higher selves we are altering ourselves from the inside out physically, genetically as well and we're breaking down... Greetings!
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. This is the Pleiadians Collective as always, it's wonderful to have the opportunity to link up with you in this way, and we'll give you back Nora if you need her again? No this is a good transition.
