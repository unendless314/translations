  source_text: So it is now what I do. It's what I've done for a very long time and my work has evolved over the years. I channel many different beings. The Pleiadian Collective is primary right now in my channeling work and then Yeshua and Calliandra are close behind, and then behind them the Lyrans and the archangels and all the other beings. And so many beings participate when we channel, you know, it's funny, you know listening to Shelley bring through Gabriel and I could feel all the other energies braiding in

  source_text: I think it helps initially to label, categorize, to help the mental body catch up and understand what it is you're already doing in your emotional and energetic and physical bodies and then once you achieve that level of understanding, it's very important to release the labels and the attachments and just be in the moment.

Afraid that I wasn't going to have what I wanted in my life, afraid that I wasn't really powerful. So that's.. then I become aware, oh I'm accessing another vibrational energy that I don't want to be playing with. And then I would just.. And that's how you could kind of discern

If you're accessing an energy and you start to feel bad in your body, it's not really an energy you want to be playing with. So the thing to do then is to just send a big transmission of unconditional love to that being, and raise your own vibration. That clears the being out of

Then you're able to reconnect with those higher vibrational beings, and then you can always - as well, if you're already channeling, so if you're familiar with the process, you can call on a being that you know to be of a higher vibrational nature that you're familiar with, to kind of reconnect, solidify those connections.
