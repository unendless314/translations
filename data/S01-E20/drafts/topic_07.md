427. The Japanese energy healing Reiki.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. Lyssa told me the mountain to go to where I can find where it was developed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. But was that-- I think the founder even said it came from the cosmos.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

430. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

431. It was downloaded to him through this sort of cosmic energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. Did that come from a specific star system or some beings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

433. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. Again, we very often use some of the star names as archetypes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. But we see that the-- well, the legends of Mount Kurama--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

436. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

437. --which is the mountain we're talking about in Kyoto, are that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. Beings from Venus--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 259

439. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

440. --originally, two million years ago, came to that mountain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Now, the question then is, did the founder of Reiki tap into Venus energy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. We would say that Venus, itself, is a portal through which other cosmic energy can come.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. We see the Reiki energy as being much more connected to Arcturist energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 261

444. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

445. It's very, very balanced and very powerful in its simplicity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

446. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. And is that a representation, then, of Arcturus, is balance and simple?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

448. Balance, simple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. You have also termed it the angelic realm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

450. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

451. It's a realm of--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

452. OK, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

453. --integration where mental, emotional, male, female, et cetera, is all balanced.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. It is also an energy that is very easy for humans to tap into when they allow themselves to do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

455. I've heard analogies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. They're like the Jedis in Star Wars.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. You know, the Arcturians, they're sort of always wearing robes and sort of in that--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

458. While, that's how they're seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Yes. >> How they're perceived.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. How we perceive them as, sort of masters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

461. Because mostly they are sixth density, so they're not physical in that way any longer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 272

462. Very masterful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And even, I've heard throughout our galaxy and universe, many other beings sort of go there to do pilgrimages and homework and--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 273

464. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 274

465. You know, and go to-- Sasha, have you been to Arcturian system to do some study and work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. Or--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 275

467. Well, in my time frame, the, you might say, high Arcturian civilization is long gone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 276

468. Oh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 277

470. Because they have gone into they're ascension process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 278

471. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 279

473. So when people are talking about that, they are talking about-- again, we're going off the timelines--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 280

474. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 281

475. --a past era--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 282

476. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 283

477. --of the civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 284

478. When there was a physical version to visit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 285

479. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 286

480. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. I'm not sure if it was you who mentioned this, but-- the Sirius energy, the way they-- sort of their evolution is they tapped into their emotional body through their mental pineal gland direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 287

482. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 288

483. You know, and that was sort of their evolutionary state.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. Took them a while.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. But through the mental body, they were actually able to access their emotional bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 289

486. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. They took the back door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 290

488. They took the back door.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. Which is fascinating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. And you know, I see so many similarities in humanity where we get very mental.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 291

491. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 292

492. And I was wondering-- I've been working a lot with the Amazonian medicine, ayahuasca.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. And the chemical compound, which induces a psychedelic trance state, is DMT, dimethyltryptamine, which is very-- I see it very third eye going into that state.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. And that's sort of resonated when I heard that download because it feels that's a similar path using this medicine in a mental way to connect to the emotional body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 293

495. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. It's similar to the work the Sirians did, but with a booster rocket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 294

497. With a booster-- so they-- the ayahuasca is the booster rocket?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 295

498. The ayahuasca is the booster rocket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 296

499. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 297

500. The Sirians, being that their lineage is Vegan, are very hard core.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. And they didn't-- for most of the time, didn't like to use help--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 298

502. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 299

503. --so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. But humans like shortcuts sometimes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. And we don't mean that in any way disrespectful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 300

506. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 301

507. But it's like a booster rocket for the same idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 302

508. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 303

509. If it's used properly, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 304

510. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. And the energy of the ayahuasca spirit that the shamans speak of, this Grandmother Earth energy, that's the way I've always seen her, is this almost a collective unconditional love, Mother Earth energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 305

512. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 306

513. That being, I was wondering on a galactic scale-- how do the other ET races interact with that energy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. Do they interact?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. And is that part of-- is that part of the Earth's collective consciousness?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 307

516. It is part of the Earth's collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. And it goes back to some of what we were talking about in terms of how every planet, every sun has its own consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 308

518. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

519. And so from the point of view of an ET, such as myself, whenever we come to a planet to do any type of work as an offering or as a service, we have to get permission from that collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 310

520. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 311

521. First and foremost.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. So you, as humans, are moving toward this as well, in terms of recognizing your own planet as a living consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. And of course, once you do, everything changes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 312

524. Oh, I already have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. And tapping into that energy is-- it's so beautiful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. And I'm working with the medicine and working with the shamans and our indigenous cultures who have been working with this energy for thousands of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 313

527. Thousands of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 314

528. With or without the medicine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. You know, the medicine is just a permission slip--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 315

530. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 316

531. --to talk to this energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. But it's so beautiful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. And I'm just assuming that that collective energy is interacting with the Pleiadian collective energies on-- and other Sirian collectives--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 317

534. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 318

535. --on a greater galactic scale of--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 319

536. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. We have to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. We have to do it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 320

539. So with that-- would she be part of the Association of Worlds?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 321

540. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 322

542. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
