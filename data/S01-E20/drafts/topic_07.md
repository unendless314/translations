501. And they didn't-- for most of the time, didn't like to use help--

## Speaker Group 304

510. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. And the energy of the ayahuasca spirit that the shamans speak of, this Grandmother Earth energy, that's the way I've always seen her, is this almost a collective unconditional love, Mother Earth energy.
→ {"text": "而且薩滿所說的死藤水靈魂的能量,這個大地祖母能量,我一直以來都是這樣看待她的,這幾乎是一種集體無條件的愛,大地母親的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 307

516. It is part of the Earth's collective consciousness.

## Speaker Group 308

518. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 309

519. And so from the point of view of an ET, such as myself, whenever we come to a planet to do any type of work as an offering or as a service, we have to get permission from that collective consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以從一個外星人的角度,像我這樣的,每當我們來到一個行星,要做任何類型的工作,作為一種奉獻或服務,我們必須從那個集體意識獲得許可。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
