226. So I was wondering in our native cultures, in the past, we have had-- across the world we've had, obviously, we've had pyramids, and we've had native cultures with high ideals.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Native American Indians, Peruvian, Amazonian tribes that have really, when we look at it now, a highly evolved sense of being and way of life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

228. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

229. Were those cultures, where those beings, at a higher density?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. Were they fourth density?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

231. Well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

232. Or were they still third?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

233. It depends on the era.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

234. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

235. Because civilizations have a tendency-- physical civilizations will have a tendency of cycling from third to fourth density, sometimes repeating it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

236. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

237. Until the time is right for the shift.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

238. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

239. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. But you're going to find that with the indigenous species on your planet, or the indigenous races, excuse us, on your planet that even though they are halfway around the world from each other, your struck by the similarities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

241. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

242. And pyramids and practices and things such as that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. Two main reasons for this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. One is because of the ET influence, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. Another is because a lot of those structures and practices came from Vegan mysticism, which came to Earth from Mars, originally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

246. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

247. So that's why there is-- if you could really see the history of your solar system, you would see the continuity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

248. Right, the linear--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

249. And then, going all the way back to Vega.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

250. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. So the Vegans, did they colonize Mars?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

252. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

253. They colonized Mars very early on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. They colonized Mars well before the Earth was even stable for colonies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

255. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. And the destruction of Mars-- I've heard that there was-- some say there was a nuclear event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. There was-- where-- or is that just because of the density that we're in, we perceive it that way?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

258. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. Actually, we've given a session on this, but Germane, who gave the session, has never really spoken specifically about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. However, what he has said is that there were a-- there was a series of events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Some were cataclysmic with asteroids and things such as that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. Some were political.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. Some things-- so everything, a perfect storm, you might say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

264. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. There's the idea or the talk of Maldek being a planet within our solar system that now makes up the Kuiper Belt.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

266. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. Similar history to Mars.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

268. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. I was going to say, did Mars come after the destruction of-- did Mars-- does destruction--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

270. It was parallel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

271. Parallel, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 163

272. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

273. And then, our moon, did it come from the Maldek civilization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Or is that-- because I've heard different variations of the moon being artificial, put into place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

275. It's not artificial, per se, but it's been, let's say, terraformed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

276. Terraformed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

278. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

279. Was it native to our planet?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. Or was it sort of put there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

281. It was not native.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. Let's say, it was a wanderer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

283. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. A wanderer and it found its position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

285. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

286. And it fixed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

288. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Was there-- so is it its own celestial being with consciousness?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

290. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

291. Light?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

292. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

293. When we think of artificial, we think that there's been some sort of outside manipulation--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

294. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

295. --done to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

296. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

297. But even that outside artificial manipulation, in a way, is still part of that consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

298. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

299. Like Earth right now, we're making genetically-modified foods and chemically enhancing and doing all kinds of things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. But it's still naturally artificial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. [LAUGHING]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

302. There you go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. It doesn't mean it's not harmful--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

305. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

306. --necessarily.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. But, you know, it's the whole idea of what consciousness is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. Consciousness permeates everything, so can you ever take a slice and make it not consciousness?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
