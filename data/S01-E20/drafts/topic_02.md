## Speaker Group 2

21. Um, we have...
→ {"text": "嗯，我們有⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. I feel like, you know, again, looking in our sky we have, you know, we have the Draconian way of doing things, we have the Pleiadian way of doing things, the Sirian way of doing things, the Sassani,  the Yahyel, the ... You know, all of these different ways.  And, and ,
→ {"text": "我覺得，你知道，再次審視我們的天空，我們有天龍座的做事方式、昴宿星的做事方式、天狼星的做事方式、薩莎尼、亞耶爾⋯⋯你知道，所有這些不同的方式。而且，而且，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

23. Because you know, when you're, when you're looking at consciousness as it is expressed in 3rd density or even early 4th density, you can still see the idea of separate paths - the Draconian way or the Pleiadian way or the Sirian way.
→ {"text": "因為你知道，當你在觀察意識在第三密度、甚至第四密度早期的表現時，你仍然可以看到分離路徑的概念——天龍座的方式、昴宿星的方式、或天狼星的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

24. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

25. But actually as you move farther and farther into 4th density, the paths become a big... a much wider road that contains them all, and that's when you start to see the path has always been the same, it just was shaped and smelled differently, so to speak... but it's always been the same path.
→ {"text": "但實際上，當你越來越深入第四密度時，這些路徑會變成一條⋯⋯一條更寬廣的大道，包含了所有這些路徑，那時你就會開始看到，路徑一直都是相同的，只是形狀和氣味不同，可以這麼說⋯⋯但它一直都是同一條路徑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

26. So in your guys' evolution.... state right now, you sort of just are maybe more awoken to that idea, that the path is the same and therefore it...
→ {"text": "所以在你們的進化⋯⋯現在的狀態中，你們某種程度上只是更加覺醒到這個想法，也就是路徑是相同的，因此它⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

27. It doesn't matter...
→ {"text": "並不重要⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

28. And our perception it may look like we have all these choices...
→ {"text": "在我們的認知中，可能看起來我們有所有這些選擇⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

29. Exactly...
→ {"text": "正是如此⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

30. but in reality we're just going to end up going the one that we're gonna feel excited about.
→ {"text": "但現實中，我們最終只會走上那條讓我們感到興奮的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

31. Exactly, and of course my reality structure is very different, so when children are born in my world we know right away what their path is, what their highest excitement is, as you've said.
→ {"text": "正是如此，當然我的實相結構非常不同，所以當孩子在我的世界出生時，我們立刻就知道他們的路徑是什麼，他們最高的興奮點是什麼，就像你所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. And that is nurtured, and the child is taught from a very young age to express that, and this is one of the reasons why in the contact work we do, we often bring children for the contact work with humans, because those in our society who will be the future ambassadors of contact on many worlds, display those talents and those joys very early on.
→ {"text": "而這會被培養，孩子從很小的時候就被教導去表達這一點，這也是我們在接觸工作中經常帶孩子來與人類進行接觸工作的原因之一，因為在我們社會中，那些將來會成為多個世界接觸大使的人，會很早就展現出這些天賦和這些喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

33. So you're not forcing everybody to be a doctor and a lawyer?
→ {"text": "所以你們不會強迫每個人都當醫生或律師？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

34. No, (laughs)
→ {"text": "不會（笑）", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

35. exactly, exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

36. And I feel like we're moving out of that.
→ {"text": "而且我覺得我們正在擺脫那種狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

37. You are moving out of that.  We know it doesn't look that way, but you are.
→ {"text": "你們正在擺脫那種狀況。我們知道看起來不像，但你們確實是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

38. When it comes to working with all these different energies, and in past channelings you've talked about the Association of Worlds.
→ {"text": "當談到與所有這些不同的能量一起工作時，在過去的通靈中你談到過諸世界聯盟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

39. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. And is your society part of this Association?
→ {"text": "你們的社會是這個聯盟的一部分嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

41. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "是的，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. And is...?
→ {"text": "那是⋯⋯？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子未完整，保留疑問語氣"}


## Speaker Group 20

43. It's not like Star Trek.
→ {"text": "不像《星艦迷航記》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Star Trek 使用台灣慣用譯名"}


## Speaker Group 21

44. It's not quite like Star Trek, no.
→ {"text": "不完全像《星艦迷航記》，不是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. But Star Trek is a wonderful metaphor for you to understand it.
→ {"text": "但《星艦迷航記》是一個很好的隱喻，可以幫助你們理解它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

46. Right, I get it.
→ {"text": "對，我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. And in the Association, you've sort of moved out of battling and wars, and you can't really be part of the Association if you have that sort of dominating enslavement idea?
→ {"text": "而在聯盟中，你們已經某種程度上擺脫了戰鬥和戰爭，如果你有那種支配奴役的想法，就不能真正成為聯盟的一部分？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

48. Yes, however... forgive us for being picky but we're going to just be picky about the words.
→ {"text": "是的，然而⋯⋯原諒我們挑剔，但我們要對用詞挑剔一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "保留通靈存有謹慎措辭的特色"}

49. It's not a matter of "You can't be in our club,"
→ {"text": "這不是「你不能加入我們俱樂部」的問題，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

50. Okay. ...so to speak.
→ {"text": "好的。⋯⋯可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Literally those who are still in 3rd density still experiencing battles and conflicts simply don't resonate with the idea that we are.
→ {"text": "字面上來說，那些仍處於第三密度、仍在經歷戰鬥和衝突的存有，根本無法與我們所處的理念共振。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

52. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. And would this be the same with higher density Draconian densities that are, sort of, again, battling out the Orion war idea?
→ {"text": "那更高密度的天龍座密度也是一樣嗎，他們某種程度上仍在戰鬥著獵戶座戰爭的理念？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "higher density Draconian densities 語義有些重複，保留原文意思"}

54. Are they...?  Did the Association of Worlds exist during the Orion wars?
→ {"text": "他們是⋯⋯？在獵戶座戰爭期間，諸世界聯盟存在嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

55. It was in a different form.
→ {"text": "它以不同的形式存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

56. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. Because the Orion wars were really so very long ago,
→ {"text": "因為獵戶座戰爭真的是非常、非常久以前的事了，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

58. Right. and because of that the only "elder species" were few and far between.
→ {"text": "對。也因此當時唯一的「長者物種」很少，而且相距甚遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

59. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

60. But it was... they did have a version of it, but even then, it was the very clear idea that you cannot interfere, because all 3rd density species have to go through their process, and...
→ {"text": "但它是⋯⋯他們確實有一個版本，但即使在那時，也有一個非常明確的理念，就是你不能干涉，因為所有第三密度物種都必須經歷他們的過程，而⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

61. So was the Orion wars primarily a 3rd density event?
→ {"text": "所以獵戶座戰爭主要是第三密度的事件嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

62. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. It was a 3rd density event, and it also carried over into the beginning phases of 4th density as well...
→ {"text": "它是第三密度的事件，也延續到第四密度的初始階段⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

64. I see...
→ {"text": "我明白了⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. Until it became impossible to maintain the separation any longer.
→ {"text": "直到無法再維持分離為止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

66. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. Yeah, and again so going back to the densities, The idea of higher density versions of different races and I'm gonna...
→ {"text": "是的，再次回到密度的話題，不同種族的更高密度版本的概念，而我要⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. I keep bringing up the Draconians because I feel there's a lot of resonance with that archetypal energy right now on planet earth, because we are, we have such a mixed bag of that and we all, you know the reptilian DNA is in us, if I'm correct? And we are working through those... that karma so to say.
→ {"text": "我一直提到天龍座，因為我感覺現在地球上與那種原型能量有很多共振，因為我們是，我們有很多混雜的那種能量，而且我們所有人，你知道爬蟲類的 DNA 在我們體內，如果我沒錯的話？而且我們正在處理那些⋯⋯可以說那種業力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. Karma in a different way...
→ {"text": "以不同方式的業力⋯⋯", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

70. Yes. ... than we're familiar with.
→ {"text": "是的。⋯⋯與我們熟悉的不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. So at these higher density versions of Draconian energy, do they still hold those same archetypes that we're familiar with in 3rd density?
→ {"text": "所以在這些更高密度版本的天龍座能量中，他們仍然保有我們在第三密度所熟悉的那些相同原型嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

72. No.
→ {"text": "不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. No.
→ {"text": "不會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. You're going to find that the idea of "battling" ...
→ {"text": "你會發現「戰鬥」的概念⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

75. Yes
→ {"text": "是的", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

76. It wears itself out in the early phases of 4th density.
→ {"text": "它在第四密度的早期階段就消耗殆盡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

77. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

78. So when you're talking about higher-level Draconian consciousness, it has gone more into deep unconditional love.
→ {"text": "所以當你談論更高層次的天龍座意識時，它已經更深入地進入無條件的愛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

79. Mmm, okay.
→ {"text": "嗯，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. So if you go to a 6th - 7th density Draconian being, vast differences between...
→ {"text": "所以如果你看第六、第七密度的天龍座存有，與⋯⋯之間有巨大的差異", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

81. Oh, yes...
→ {"text": "哦，是的⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

82. between the 3rd density version.
→ {"text": "與第三密度版本之間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

83. Yes, vast differences.
→ {"text": "是的，巨大的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

84. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. Probably we can't even conceptualize what that is?
→ {"text": "我們可能甚至無法概念化那是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

86. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. But it's still,  it's a very unique evolutionary path very separate from the Pleiadian perspective.
→ {"text": "但它仍然是一條非常獨特的進化路徑，與昴宿星的觀點非常不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

88. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "是的，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

89. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
