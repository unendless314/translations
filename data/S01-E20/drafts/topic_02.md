## Speaker Group 2

21. Um, we have...
→ {"text": "嗯，我們有⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. I feel like, you know, again, looking in our sky we have, you know, we have the Draconian way of doing things, we have the Pleiadian way of doing things, the Sirian way of doing things, the Sassani,  the Yahyel, the ... You know, all of these different ways.  And, and ,
→ {"text": "我覺得，你知道，再次審視我們的天空，我們有天龍座的做事方式、昴宿星的做事方式、天狼星的做事方式、薩莎尼、亞耶爾⋯⋯你知道，所有這些不同的方式。而且，而且，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

23. Because you know, when you're, when you're looking at consciousness as it is expressed in 3rd density or even early 4th density, you can still see the idea of separate paths - the Draconian way or the Pleiadian way or the Sirian way.
→ {"text": "因為你知道，當你在觀察意識在第三密度、甚至第四密度早期的表現時，你仍然可以看到分離路徑的概念——天龍座的方式、昴宿星的方式、或天狼星的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

24. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

25. But actually as you move farther and farther into 4th density, the paths become a big... a much wider road that contains them all, and that's when you start to see the path has always been the same, it just was shaped and smelled differently, so to speak... but it's always been the same path.
→ {"text": "但實際上，當你越來越深入第四密度時，這些路徑會變成一條⋯⋯一條更寬廣的大道，包含了所有這些路徑，那時你就會開始看到，路徑一直都是相同的，只是形狀和氣味不同，可以這麼說⋯⋯但它一直都是同一條路徑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

26. So in your guys' evolution.... state right now, you sort of just are maybe more awoken to that idea, that the path is the same and therefore it...
→ {"text": "所以在你們的進化⋯⋯現在的狀態中，你們某種程度上只是更加覺醒到這個想法，也就是路徑是相同的，因此它⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

27. It doesn't matter...
→ {"text": "並不重要⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

28. And our perception it may look like we have all these choices...
→ {"text": "在我們的認知中，可能看起來我們有所有這些選擇⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

29. Exactly...
→ {"text": "正是如此⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

30. but in reality we're just going to end up going the one that we're gonna feel excited about.
→ {"text": "但現實中，我們最終只會走上那條讓我們感到興奮的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

31. Exactly, and of course my reality structure is very different, so when children are born in my world we know right away what their path is, what their highest excitement is, as you've said.
→ {"text": "正是如此，當然我的實相結構非常不同，所以當孩子在我的世界出生時，我們立刻就知道他們的路徑是什麼，他們最高的興奮點是什麼，就像你所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. And that is nurtured, and the child is taught from a very young age to express that, and this is one of the reasons why in the contact work we do, we often bring children for the contact work with humans, because those in our society who will be the future ambassadors of contact on many worlds, display those talents and those joys very early on.
→ {"text": "而這會被培養，孩子從很小的時候就被教導去表達這一點，這也是我們在接觸工作中經常帶孩子來與人類進行接觸工作的原因之一，因為在我們社會中，那些將來會成為多個世界接觸大使的人，會很早就展現出這些天賦和這些喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

33. So you're not forcing everybody to be a doctor and a lawyer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

34. No, (laughs)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

35. exactly, exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

36. And I feel like we're moving out of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

37. You are moving out of that.  We know it doesn't look that way, but you are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

38. When it comes to working with all these different energies, and in past channelings you've talked about the Association of Worlds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

39. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. And is your society part of this Association?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

41. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. And is...?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

43. It's not like Star Trek.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

44. It's not quite like Star Trek, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. But Star Trek is a wonderful metaphor for you to understand it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

46. Right, I get it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. And in the Association, you've sort of moved out of battling and wars, and you can't really be part of the Association if you have that sort of dominating enslavement idea?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

48. Yes, however... forgive us for being picky but we're going to just be picky about the words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. It's not a matter of "You can't be in our club,"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

50. Okay. ...so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Literally those who are still in 3rd density still experiencing battles and conflicts simply don't resonate with the idea that we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

52. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. And would this be the same with higher density Draconian densities that are, sort of, again, battling out the Orion war idea?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. Are they...?  Did the Association of Worlds exist during the Orion wars?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

55. It was in a different form.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

56. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. Because the Orion wars were really so very long ago,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

58. Right. and because of that the only "elder species" were few and far between.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

59. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

60. But it was... they did have a version of it, but even then, it was the very clear idea that you cannot interfere, because all 3rd density species have to go through their process, and...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

61. So was the Orion wars primarily a 3rd density event?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

62. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. It was a 3rd density event, and it also carried over into the beginning phases of 4th density as well...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

64. I see...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. Until it became impossible to maintain the separation any longer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

66. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. Yeah, and again so going back to the densities, The idea of higher density versions of different races and I'm gonna...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. I keep bringing up the Draconians because I feel there's a lot of resonance with that archetypal energy right now on planet earth, because we are, we have such a mixed bag of that and we all, you know the reptilian DNA is in us, if I'm correct? And we are working through those... that karma so to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. Karma in a different way...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

70. Yes. ... than we're familiar with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. So at these higher density versions of Draconian energy, do they still hold those same archetypes that we're familiar with in 3rd density?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

72. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. You're going to find that the idea of "battling" ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

75. Yes
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

76. It wears itself out in the early phases of 4th density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

77. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

78. So when you're talking about higher-level Draconian consciousness, it has gone more into deep unconditional love.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

79. Mmm, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. So if you go to a 6th - 7th density Draconian being, vast differences between...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

81. Oh, yes...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

82. between the 3rd density version.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

83. Yes, vast differences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

84. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Probably we can't even conceptualize what that is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

86. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. But it's still,  it's a very unique evolutionary path very separate from the Pleiadian perspective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

88. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

89. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
