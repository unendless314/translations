310. I see.

## Speaker Group 189

311. It's just a difference of whether it's dormant or aware of itself or not.
→ {"text": "這只是它是處於休眠狀態，還是對自身有意識的差別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. Now, in terms of planets, however--
→ {"text": "不過，就行星而言——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

313. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

314. --and especially suns, you're going to find that what you call the core of the planet or the sun is an entry point-- exit and entry point, dimensionally.
→ {"text": "——尤其是恆星，你會發現，你們所說的行星或恆星的核心，是一個出入口——從維度上來說，是出口和入口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. So this is why celestial bodies have consciousness.
→ {"text": "所以這就是為什麼天體擁有意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. Because the consciousness, literally the consciousness of creation, breathes itself in and out through those portals in the center of the core of whether it's a sun or a planet.
→ {"text": "因為意識，字面意義上來說，創造的意識，透過那些位於恆星或行星核心中央的門戶，將自身呼吸進出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. So-- and we're talking-- you know, we're not necessarily talking about a rock flying in space.
→ {"text": "所以——我們說的是——你知道的，我們說的不一定是一塊在太空中飛行的岩石。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

318. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

319. We're talking more about a planetary body that even perhaps has a slight gravitational field.
→ {"text": "我們說的更多是指一個行星體，它甚至可能擁有輕微的重力場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

320. That doesn't necessarily mean the size of the--
→ {"text": "這不一定意味著它的大小——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

321. Yes it's not really dictated by size.
→ {"text": "是的，這並不是真正由大小決定的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

322. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

323. Because gravity has much more to it than just the size factor.
→ {"text": "因為重力不僅僅取決於大小因素，還有更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

324. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

325. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. And--
→ {"text": "還有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

327. More often than not, you'll see the correlation.
→ {"text": "通常情況下，你會看到這種相關性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

328. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

329. But it doesn't mean one is caused by the other.
→ {"text": "但這並不意味著一個是由另一個造成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

330. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. That's what I thought.
→ {"text": "我就是這樣想的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. And in our sun's case, as you were saying, it's sort of a portal and we're getting-- that's our life force is the sun.
→ {"text": "就我們的太陽而言，如你所說的，它有點像一個門戶，我們得到的——我們的生命力就是太陽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. Now, if we were to move to another solar body galaxy, or solar system, and-- would we then shift our being?
→ {"text": "現在，如果我們要移動到另一個星體、星系，或太陽系，而——我們會因此轉變我們的存在嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. Would we no longer become human?
→ {"text": "我們會不再是人類嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. Would we become a new-- because now we're getting our energy downloads from a new celestial being, would we become a new species?
→ {"text": "我們會成為一個新的——因為現在我們從一個新的天體存有那裡接收能量下載，我們會成為一個新物種嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

336. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. So this is definitely hypothetical.
→ {"text": "所以這絕對是假設性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

338. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

339. Because at this point, humans cannot go and try out--
→ {"text": "因為在這個階段，人類無法去嘗試——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

340. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

341. And try it out, yes.
→ {"text": "並且去嘗試，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. And also because of the limitation of human consciousness to traverse space right now.
→ {"text": "而且也是因為人類意識目前在穿越太空方面的限制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. Because right now, human consciousness is tied to the gravitational field of its planet and its sun.
→ {"text": "因為現在，人類意識被束縛在它的行星和太陽的重力場上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. And this is a metaphor-- a macrocosmic metaphor for how the ego is the anchor for you on a planet.
→ {"text": "這是一個隱喻——一個宏觀的隱喻，說明小我如何成為你在一個行星上的錨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

345. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. Because the ego is like a black hole.
→ {"text": "因為小我就像一個黑洞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. Same function, so to speak.
→ {"text": "可以說，是相同的功能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. However, as you move into fourth density, deeper and deeper into fourth density, and the anchor that is ego and individuality becomes metaphorically lighter, therefore, you're able, in a sense, to escape the gravitational field and not be influenced so much by it.
→ {"text": "然而，當你進入第四密度，越來越深入第四密度時，作為小我和個體性的錨在隱喻上變得更輕，因此，從某種意義上說，你能夠擺脫重力場，不再那麼受它的影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. So space travel becomes no longer traveling on the surface of space.
→ {"text": "所以太空旅行不再是在空間的表面上旅行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. It, instead, becomes traveling through space or becoming one with space in a very, very different way.
→ {"text": "相反地，它變成了穿越空間，或以一種非常、非常不同的方式與空間合一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. So we had to lay that groundwork in order to answer your question.
→ {"text": "所以我們必須先打好這個基礎，才能回答你的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

352. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

354. Right now, if you were to be picked up and taken to another planet in another solar system, it would be very, very hard to make the adaptation.
→ {"text": "現在，如果你被接走並帶到另一個太陽系的另一個行星上，要適應會非常、非常困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

355. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

356. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. But if you were more deeper into fourth density in terms of your evolution, thus your egoic anchor was lighter, it would be easier for you to go through a metamorphosis if you were planted, so to speak, in another solar system.
→ {"text": "但如果你在進化上更深入第四密度，因此你的小我之錨更輕，那麼如果你被種植，可以說，在另一個太陽系中，你經歷蛻變會更容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. It would be easier.
→ {"text": "會更容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

359. And is that-- going to the hybrid programs for the Zetas-- is that-- part of that creating new beings, so to say, and populating new planets and new star systems, or new solar systems, with new DNA?
→ {"text": "那麼這是——說到齊塔人的混種計畫——這是——可以說，創造新存有的一部分，並用新的 DNA 填充新的行星和新的星系，或新的太陽系嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

360. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. It's one of the reasons why hybridization is the better chosen method than colonization.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼混種化是比殖民更好的選擇方法的原因之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

362. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

363. Unless the circumstances are such that where you're colonizing is very similar--
→ {"text": "除非你要殖民的地方情況非常相似——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

364. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

365. --hybridization is much more appropriate, which is why the original Lyrans in the very ancient times began the programs on Earth, the genetic work on Earth, because they needed to create that hybridization for their future incarnations.
→ {"text": "——混種化要更合適得多，這就是為什麼最初的天琴座人在非常古老的時代就開始了地球上的計畫，地球上的基因工作，因為他們需要為他們未來的轉世創造那種混種化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Lyrans 譯為天琴座人，與昴宿星人等譯法一致"}

366. Colonization was not a comfortable option.
→ {"text": "殖民不是一個舒適的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

367. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. So when we even-- what if it was within our solar system, like Mars, if we were to go to Mars or go to Venus?
→ {"text": "那麼，即使我們——如果是在我們的太陽系內呢，像火星，如果我們去火星或去金星？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. Is that a--
→ {"text": "那是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

370. It would be easier.
→ {"text": "會更容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. However-- and again, we're speaking metaphorically.
→ {"text": "然而——我們再次強調，我們是在隱喻地說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. This is basically-- we're going to make this simple so you understand, but let's say that-- let's say each of the planets represents an energy of a chakra, OK?
→ {"text": "這基本上是——我們會把這個簡化讓你理解，但假設說——假設每個行星代表一個脈輪的能量，好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "chakra 譯為脈輪"}

373. Earth being solar plexus chakra.
→ {"text": "地球是太陽神經叢脈輪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "solar plexus chakra 譯為太陽神經叢脈輪"}

374. Let's say, then, that you moved to another planet that represents another chakra.
→ {"text": "那麼，假設你移動到另一個代表另一個脈輪的行星。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. Basically, what you're going to experience is a similar structure, but the aspects of that chakra will need to come into play--
→ {"text": "基本上，你將體驗到相似的結構，但那個脈輪的面向需要發揮作用——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

376. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

377. --more or be activated more.
→ {"text": "——更多，或被更多地激活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. And that's the kind of the system-- the macrocosmic system in a given solar system.
→ {"text": "這就是那種系統——在一個給定太陽系中的宏觀系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

379. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. And if we were to do that, we would need, probably, technology to aid in that life force sustaining, you know, not just air and everything else, but, energetically, we would--
→ {"text": "而且如果我們要這樣做，我們可能需要技術來幫助維持那種生命力，你知道的，不僅僅是空氣和其他一切，而且在能量上，我們會——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

381. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

382. --either have to do it-- do the work ourselves or have an external technology.
→ {"text": "——要麼必須做它——自己做這項工作，要麼擁有外部技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

383. Yes, but, actually, we see that the most important thing you would need to colonize a moon of Jupiter or whatever is actually mentors, extraterrestrial mentors.
→ {"text": "是的，但實際上，我們認為你殖民木星的一顆衛星或其他任何地方所需要的最重要的東西，實際上是導師，外星導師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

384. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. To help--
→ {"text": "來幫助——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

386. To help.
→ {"text": "來幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

387. --with--
→ {"text": "——以——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

388. Yep.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

389. --explain more than what we physically know right now.
→ {"text": "——解釋比我們現在物質上所知道的更多的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

390. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

391. Because we only see such as a small sliver of what is.
→ {"text": "因為我們只看到存在之物的一小片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

392. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

393. I See.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

394. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

395. And that can help out with that.
→ {"text": "那可以在這方面提供幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

396. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

397. Now, you know, I've heard stories that humanity has a breakaway civilization of a secret space program, per se, that we've been-- individuals from humanity in the '50s and '60s worked together to sort of start colonizing our solar system.
→ {"text": "現在，你知道的，我聽說過一些故事，說人類有一個脫離文明的秘密太空計畫，可以說，我們一直——來自人類的個體在 50 年代和 60 年代合作，某種程度上開始殖民我們的太陽系。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

398. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

399. And started doing this already.
→ {"text": "並且已經開始這樣做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. And a lot of this whistleblower stuff is coming out now.
→ {"text": "而且現在很多這種揭密者的資料正在浮現出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "whistleblower 譯為揭密者"}

401. And we're sort of being made aware.
→ {"text": "我們某種程度上正在被告知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. And then, hopefully, we can join our own family back with us.
→ {"text": "然後，希望我們能讓我們自己的家人重新與我們團聚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. But they had-- I guess, they did have Draconian assistance in their evolution to colonize.
→ {"text": "但他們有——我猜，他們確實在殖民的進化過程中得到了天龍座的協助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. Is that-- am I correct in saying that?
→ {"text": "那是——我這樣說對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

405. Well, we're going to say there's truth and distortion.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們會說有真相也有扭曲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

406. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

407. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Now, when truth starts coming out, there is a whole faction on your world that works very hard to distort the truth through sensationalistic things, or red herrings, as you say.
→ {"text": "現在，當真相開始浮現時，你們世界上有一整個派系非常努力地透過聳動的事情，或者如你所說的誤導手法，來扭曲真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "red herrings 譯為誤導手法"}

409. So there is also a lot of that.
→ {"text": "所以也有很多那樣的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. The researchers, themselves, having good intentions are given very, what seems to be for them, credible information, that isn't really credible.
→ {"text": "研究者本身，懷著善意，被給予了非常、對他們來說似乎可信的資訊，但實際上並不可信。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. So the truth gets buried at another layer.
→ {"text": "所以真相被埋在另一層之下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

412. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

413. So there is a lot of different things.
→ {"text": "所以有很多不同的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. This is why we don't talk so much about this stuff.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我們不太談論這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. It's also not our mission, so to speak.
→ {"text": "可以說，這也不是我們的使命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

416. Sure, sure.
→ {"text": "當然，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

417. However, we can say, just very basically, yes, secret space programs.
→ {"text": "然而，我們可以非常基本地說，是的，秘密太空計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. Yes, the powers that be, if you will, are quite aware that Mars was once a thriving civilization, that there are things happening on the moon, et cetera, et cetera.
→ {"text": "是的，可以說，當權者們非常清楚火星曾經是一個繁榮的文明，月球上正在發生一些事情，等等等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "the powers that be 譯為當權者們"}


## Speaker Group 250

419. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. Very good.
→ {"text": "非常好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. We don't need to go into any more details.
→ {"text": "我們不需要深入更多細節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

422. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. Not our forte.
→ {"text": "不是我們的專長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

424. Not yet.
→ {"text": "還不是時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. Not until-- it'll all develop in the way it's supposed to develop.
→ {"text": "直到——一切都會以它應該發展的方式發展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

426. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
