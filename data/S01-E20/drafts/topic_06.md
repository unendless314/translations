310. I see.

## Speaker Group 189

311. It's just a difference of whether it's dormant or aware of itself or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Now, in terms of planets, however--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

313. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

314. --and especially suns, you're going to find that what you call the core of the planet or the sun is an entry point-- exit and entry point, dimensionally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. So this is why celestial bodies have consciousness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. Because the consciousness, literally the consciousness of creation, breathes itself in and out through those portals in the center of the core of whether it's a sun or a planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. So-- and we're talking-- you know, we're not necessarily talking about a rock flying in space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

318. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

319. We're talking more about a planetary body that even perhaps has a slight gravitational field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

320. That doesn't necessarily mean the size of the--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

321. Yes it's not really dictated by size.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

322. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

323. Because gravity has much more to it than just the size factor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

324. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

325. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. And--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

327. More often than not, you'll see the correlation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

328. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

329. But it doesn't mean one is caused by the other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 203

330. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. That's what I thought.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. And in our sun's case, as you were saying, it's sort of a portal and we're getting-- that's our life force is the sun.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. Now, if we were to move to another solar body galaxy, or solar system, and-- would we then shift our being?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. Would we no longer become human?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. Would we become a new-- because now we're getting our energy downloads from a new celestial being, would we become a new species?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

336. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. So this is definitely hypothetical.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

338. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

339. Because at this point, humans cannot go and try out--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

340. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

341. And try it out, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. And also because of the limitation of human consciousness to traverse space right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. Because right now, human consciousness is tied to the gravitational field of its planet and its sun.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. And this is a metaphor-- a macrocosmic metaphor for how the ego is the anchor for you on a planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

345. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Because the ego is like a black hole.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. Same function, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. However, as you move into fourth density, deeper and deeper into fourth density, and the anchor that is ego and individuality becomes metaphorically lighter, therefore, you're able, in a sense, to escape the gravitational field and not be influenced so much by it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. So space travel becomes no longer traveling on the surface of space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. It, instead, becomes traveling through space or becoming one with space in a very, very different way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. So we had to lay that groundwork in order to answer your question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

352. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

354. Right now, if you were to be picked up and taken to another planet in another solar system, it would be very, very hard to make the adaptation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

355. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

356. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. But if you were more deeper into fourth density in terms of your evolution, thus your egoic anchor was lighter, it would be easier for you to go through a metamorphosis if you were planted, so to speak, in another solar system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. It would be easier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

359. And is that-- going to the hybrid programs for the Zetas-- is that-- part of that creating new beings, so to say, and populating new planets and new star systems, or new solar systems, with new DNA?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

360. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. It's one of the reasons why hybridization is the better chosen method than colonization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

362. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

363. Unless the circumstances are such that where you're colonizing is very similar--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

364. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

365. --hybridization is much more appropriate, which is why the original Lyrans in the very ancient times began the programs on Earth, the genetic work on Earth, because they needed to create that hybridization for their future incarnations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Colonization was not a comfortable option.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

367. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. So when we even-- what if it was within our solar system, like Mars, if we were to go to Mars or go to Venus?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. Is that a--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

370. It would be easier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. However-- and again, we're speaking metaphorically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. This is basically-- we're going to make this simple so you understand, but let's say that-- let's say each of the planets represents an energy of a chakra, OK?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. Earth being solar plexus chakra.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Let's say, then, that you moved to another planet that represents another chakra.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. Basically, what you're going to experience is a similar structure, but the aspects of that chakra will need to come into play--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

376. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

377. --more or be activated more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. And that's the kind of the system-- the macrocosmic system in a given solar system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

379. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. And if we were to do that, we would need, probably, technology to aid in that life force sustaining, you know, not just air and everything else, but, energetically, we would--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

381. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

382. --either have to do it-- do the work ourselves or have an external technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 227

383. Yes, but, actually, we see that the most important thing you would need to colonize a moon of Jupiter or whatever is actually mentors, extraterrestrial mentors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

384. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. To help--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

386. To help.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

387. --with--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

388. Yep.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 232

389. --explain more than what we physically know right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

390. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

391. Because we only see such as a small sliver of what is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

392. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

393. I See.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

394. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

395. And that can help out with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 239

396. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

397. Now, you know, I've heard stories that humanity has a breakaway civilization of a secret space program, per se, that we've been-- individuals from humanity in the '50s and '60s worked together to sort of start colonizing our solar system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

398. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

399. And started doing this already.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. And a lot of this whistleblower stuff is coming out now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. And we're sort of being made aware.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. And then, hopefully, we can join our own family back with us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. But they had-- I guess, they did have Draconian assistance in their evolution to colonize.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. Is that-- am I correct in saying that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

405. Well, we're going to say there's truth and distortion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

406. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

407. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. Now, when truth starts coming out, there is a whole faction on your world that works very hard to distort the truth through sensationalistic things, or red herrings, as you say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. So there is also a lot of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. The researchers, themselves, having good intentions are given very, what seems to be for them, credible information, that isn't really credible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. So the truth gets buried at another layer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

412. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

413. So there is a lot of different things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. This is why we don't talk so much about this stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. It's also not our mission, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

416. Sure, sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

417. However, we can say, just very basically, yes, secret space programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. Yes, the powers that be, if you will, are quite aware that Mars was once a thriving civilization, that there are things happening on the moon, et cetera, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

419. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. Very good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. We don't need to go into any more details.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 251

422. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. Not our forte.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

424. Not yet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. Not until-- it'll all develop in the way it's supposed to develop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

426. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
