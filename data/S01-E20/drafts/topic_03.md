90. I've gotten this download. I had a visitation from a Mantis being... and this goes into...

91. The download that I got I'm still trying to digest, and maybe you can help me with this?
→ {"text": "我得到的下載訊息我還在試著消化，也許你可以幫我理解這個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. Is that the Draconian energy was sort of wanting to experience itself, wanted to evolve past 6th or 7th density.  That the Draconians, that energy archetype, sort of had a hard time going past that density, that version of existence because of its grasping onto a physical form.
→ {"text": "也就是說，天龍座能量某種程度上想要體驗自己，想要進化超越第六或第七密度。天龍座，那種能量原型，某種程度上很難超越那個密度、那個存在版本，因為它緊抓著物質形式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

93. To us because the 4th density is the last...
→ {"text": "對我們來說，因為第四密度是最後的⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

94. Oh, that's right! ...in the way we measure
→ {"text": "哦，沒錯！⋯⋯以我們衡量的方式", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

95. There is, once you move into 5th, 6th, or 7th there no longer is physical bodies.
→ {"text": "確實是這樣，一旦你進入第五、第六或第七密度，就不再有物質身體了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

96. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

97. Now there have been many species who tried very hard to cling to physicality and not move into the non-physical expression in 5th density.
→ {"text": "現在有許多物種非常努力地緊抓著物質性，不願進入第五密度的非物質表達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

98. Maybe that?
→ {"text": "也許是那樣？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

99. It could be that...
→ {"text": "可能是那樣⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

100. That version.
→ {"text": "那個版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. I guess the main thing I got and I sort of assumed because of my understanding of densities, but the main thing I got was the Draconian energy, because of it's resistance to go into a non-physical reality, but there was still a portion of that energy that wanted to move in to that...
→ {"text": "我想我得到的主要訊息是，我基於對密度的理解而做出的某種假設，但我得到的主要訊息是，天龍座能量因為抗拒進入非物質實相，但仍有一部分能量想要進入那個⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

102. Yes. ...energy. Therefore it called upon the Mantis beings to help move, help design a plan, and that's sort of what humanity was, is, is a plan to help move that consciousness into a non-physical reality, evolution.
→ {"text": "是的。⋯⋯能量。因此它召喚了螳螂存有來幫助推動，幫助設計一個計畫，而人類某種程度上就是，就是一個幫助將那個意識移入非物質實相進化的計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. I don't know if that makes any sense?
→ {"text": "我不知道這有沒有道理？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

104. Well you, but you brought something up that is very key here.
→ {"text": "嗯，你，但你提出了一個非常關鍵的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

105. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. And you're calling them Mantis beings.
→ {"text": "而你稱他們為螳螂存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

107. Sure.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

108. We call them Founders, same idea and if we can... we'll just give you our definition of them from the bigger picture.
→ {"text": "我們稱他們為創始者，同樣的概念，如果可以的話⋯⋯我們就從更大的圖景給你我們對他們的定義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

109. Mmm-um
→ {"text": "嗯嗯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

110. So when the one consciousness began its fragmentation that eventually became the souls that have the individual lives.
→ {"text": "所以當那個合一的意識開始分裂，最終成為擁有個體生命的靈魂時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. One of the first fragments from the Source was a collective, beings that we call Founders, that are kind of the architects.
→ {"text": "從本源分化出的最初片段之一是一個集體，我們稱之為創始者的存有，他們有點像建築師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

112. Mmm - um
→ {"text": "嗯嗯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

113. and when humans feel or perceive their energy, they see them as Mantis or insectoid, that's one of the ways they appear.
→ {"text": "而當人類感受或感知到他們的能量時，他們會看到螳螂或昆蟲形態，那是他們顯現的方式之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

114. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

115. Another way they appear are the very tall willowy beings that...
→ {"text": "他們顯現的另一種方式是非常高大、苗條的存有⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

116. Was this Barbara Lamb's ...?
→ {"text": "這是 Barbara Lamb 的⋯⋯？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "人名保留英文"}


## Speaker Group 69

117. Yes, the spring onion beings, Founder beings.
→ {"text": "是的，青蔥存有，創始者存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "spring onion beings 為幽默比喻，保持輕鬆語氣"}


## Speaker Group 70

118. Perfect, okay that ok, makes sense now.
→ {"text": "完美，好的，現在說得通了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

119. Yes, and so these beings known as the architects, are overseeing so to speak the building of the structure of the physical stage play, let's say, and so whenever a civilization or a species gets "in trouble", so to speak, we have a tendency to call them for guidance.
→ {"text": "是的，所以這些被稱為建築師的存有，可以說是在監督物質舞台劇的結構建造，這麼說吧，所以每當一個文明或物種「陷入困境」時，可以說，我們都有傾向召喚他們來尋求指引。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

120. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

121. The Orions did, the Pleiades did, the Sirians did, the Zetas did, the Dracos did.
→ {"text": "獵戶座人這麼做過，昴宿星人這麼做過，天狼星人這麼做過，齊塔人這麼做過，天龍座人這麼做過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

122. Right okay, yeah, the Zetas, I got that too that...
→ {"text": "對好的，是的，齊塔人，我也得到了那個訊息⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. Did the Zetas even have the technology to travel inter-dimensionally to our timeline?
→ {"text": "齊塔人甚至有跨維度旅行到我們時間線的技術嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. I don't ... I got that the Mantis helped out with that a little bit.
→ {"text": "我不⋯⋯我得到的訊息是螳螂在那方面稍微幫了點忙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

125. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. Zetas though are... they are quite unique as you well know, and because they were able to harness such intense energy of mentality they could do things in terms of the traveling through time lines that no other species could do.
→ {"text": "不過齊塔人是⋯⋯如你所知，他們非常獨特，因為他們能夠駕馭如此強烈的心智能量，所以他們能夠在穿越時間線方面做到其他物種無法做到的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

127. Oh really, okay.
→ {"text": "哦真的，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. So that's one of the reasons why too they could do that.
→ {"text": "所以這也是他們能夠做到那一點的原因之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

129. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "太迷人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. And these Mantis beings often in abduction scenarios, temporary detainment scenarios, show up sort of in the background.
→ {"text": "而這些螳螂存有經常在綁架情境、臨時拘留情境中，某種程度上出現在背景中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

131. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "是的，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

132. And so I'm assuming this is probably why, and seen with many different races too.
→ {"text": "所以我假設這可能就是原因，而且也與許多不同種族一起被看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. Oh, there's a Mantis being with a Pleiadian, or...
→ {"text": "哦，有螳螂存有和昴宿星人在一起，或者⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. That is why, they're like overseers.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼，他們就像監督者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

135. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "太迷人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. And not in a controlling way of course.
→ {"text": "當然不是以控制的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

137. And are they in a specific density or they sort of can manifest in any density depending on who's in trouble?
→ {"text": "那他們是在特定密度，還是他們可以根據誰陷入困境而在任何密度中顯現？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. Well, we say primarily 7th density because even though they're manifesting seemingly as "a being" it's really a collective. So they cannot manifest physically, which is one of the reasons why in a sense, now we're using this figuratively, they could "channel through" more physical beings.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們會說主要是第七密度，因為即使他們看似顯現為「一個存有」，實際上是一個集體。所以他們無法以物質形式顯現，這也是為什麼在某種意義上，現在我們是比喻性地說，他們可以「通靈穿過」更多物質的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. So if you have Zetas accompanied by a Mantis, it's not that the Mantis is physically there, but the human is perceiving the energy, and can interpret it.
→ {"text": "所以如果你有齊塔人伴隨著螳螂，並不是螳螂實際在那裡，而是人類正在感知那個能量，並且可以詮釋它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

140. Right, yeah, my sort of download was not a physical interaction, it was more of a data drop.
→ {"text": "對，是的，我那種下載不是物質互動，更像是資料投放。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

141. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. At least that's the way it felt.
→ {"text": "至少那是我的感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

143. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. It's very, very unique and I've... to date it's been my really only conscious interaction with an extraterrestrial presence in that sense.
→ {"text": "這非常、非常獨特，而且我⋯⋯到目前為止，這真的是我唯一在那種意義上與外星存在的有意識互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. Well, how many days do you have in Sedona coming up? (laughs) Hmm, we'll see about that.
→ {"text": "嗯，你接下來在賽多納有多少天？（笑）嗯，我們走著瞧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Sedona 為美國亞利桑那州地名"}


## Speaker Group 85

146. Alright, very cool.
→ {"text": "好的，非常酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
