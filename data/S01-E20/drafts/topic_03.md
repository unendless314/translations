90. I've gotten this download. I had a visitation from a Mantis being... and this goes into...

91. The download that I got I'm still trying to digest, and maybe you can help me with this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Is that the Draconian energy was sort of wanting to experience itself, wanted to evolve past 6th or 7th density.  That the Draconians, that energy archetype, sort of had a hard time going past that density, that version of existence because of its grasping onto a physical form.

## Speaker Group 49

93. To us because the 4th density is the last...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

94. Oh, that's right! ...in the way we measure
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

95. There is, once you move into 5th, 6th, or 7th there no longer is physical bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

96. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

97. Now there have been many species who tried very hard to cling to physicality and not move into the non-physical expression in 5th density.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

98. Maybe that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

99. It could be that...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

100. That version.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. I guess the main thing I got and I sort of assumed because of my understanding of densities, but the main thing I got was the Draconian energy, because of it's resistance to go into a non-physical reality, but there was still a portion of that energy that wanted to move in to that...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

102. Yes. ...energy. Therefore it called upon the Mantis beings to help move, help design a plan, and that's sort of what humanity was, is, is a plan to help move that consciousness into a non-physical reality, evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. I don't know if that makes any sense?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

104. Well you, but you brought something up that is very key here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

105. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. And you're calling them Mantis beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

107. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

108. We call them Founders, same idea and if we can... we'll just give you our definition of them from the bigger picture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

109. Mmm-um
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

110. So when the one consciousness began its fragmentation that eventually became the souls that have the individual lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. One of the first fragments from the Source was a collective, beings that we call Founders, that are kind of the architects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

112. Mmm - um
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

113. and when humans feel or perceive their energy, they see them as Mantis or insectoid, that's one of the ways they appear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

114. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

115. Another way they appear are the very tall willowy beings that...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

116. Was this Barbara Lamb's ...?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

117. Yes, the spring onion beings, Founder beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

118. Perfect, okay that ok, makes sense now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

119. Yes, and so these beings known as the architects, are overseeing so to speak the building of the structure of the physical stage play, let's say, and so whenever a civilization or a species gets "in trouble", so to speak, we have a tendency to call them for guidance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

120. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

121. The Orions did, the Pleiades did, the Sirians did, the Zetas did, the Dracos did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

122. Right okay, yeah, the Zetas, I got that too that...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. Did the Zetas even have the technology to travel inter-dimensionally to our timeline?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. I don't ... I got that the Mantis helped out with that a little bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

125. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. Zetas though are... they are quite unique as you well know, and because they were able to harness such intense energy of mentality they could do things in terms of the traveling through time lines that no other species could do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

127. Oh really, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. So that's one of the reasons why too they could do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

129. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. And these Mantis beings often in abduction scenarios, temporary detainment scenarios, show up sort of in the background.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

131. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

132. And so I'm assuming this is probably why, and seen with many different races too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. Oh, there's a Mantis being with a Pleiadian, or...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. That is why, they're like overseers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

135. Fascinating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. And not in a controlling way of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

137. And are they in a specific density or they sort of can manifest in any density depending on who's in trouble?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. Well, we say primarily 7th density because even though they're manifesting seemingly as "a being" it's really a collective. So they cannot manifest physically, which is one of the reasons why in a sense, now we're using this figuratively, they could "channel through" more physical beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. So if you have Zetas accompanied by a Mantis, it's not that the Mantis is physically there, but the human is perceiving the energy, and can interpret it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

140. Right, yeah, my sort of download was not a physical interaction, it was more of a data drop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

141. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. At least that's the way it felt.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

143. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. It's very, very unique and I've... to date it's been my really only conscious interaction with an extraterrestrial presence in that sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. Well, how many days do you have in Sedona coming up? (laughs) Hmm, we'll see about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

146. Alright, very cool.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
