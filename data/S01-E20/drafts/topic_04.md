147. There's a lot of talk about inner earth beings, especially recently, it's sort of been in the consciousness, there's been a whistleblower who's been talking about interaction with inner earth beings and we're finding out this new history that these beings have been there for millions of years pre-dating humanity and, sort of, staying low key.
→ {"text": "最近有很多關於地心存有的討論，這某種程度上一直存在於意識中，有一位揭密者一直在談論與地心存有的互動，而且我們正在發現這段新的歷史，也就是這些存有在那裡已經有數百萬年了，早於人類之前，而且某種程度上一直保持低調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. Now, are they, those beings 4th density beings? 3rd, 4th density beings or...?
→ {"text": "那麼，他們是，那些存有是第四密度存有嗎？第三、第四密度存有，還是⋯⋯？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

149. Mostly 4th density beings.
→ {"text": "大部分是第四密度存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

150. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. There are some that are 5th density so they're not necessarily perceived as solid objects in space, but as light energy, and they're much like what we said about the Anunnaki, they're really a collective, a collective of races.
→ {"text": "有一些是第五密度，所以他們不一定被視為空間中的固體物體，而是被視為光能量，而且他們就像我們說過的阿努納奇，他們實際上是一個集體，一個種族的集體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

152. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. So yes, so there's many different races... in the inner earth.
→ {"text": "所以是的，所以在地心有許多不同的種族⋯⋯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

154. Yes And because at different densities, different frequencies, if for example, are we only now able to perceive them because we're shifting into this fourth density?
→ {"text": "是的，而且因為在不同的密度、不同的頻率，比如說，我們是不是只有現在才能感知到他們，因為我們正在轉換到這個第四密度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

155. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "是的，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

156. And if we were to try let's say in our past timelines of 3rd density,  even a hundred years ago, if we were to try to burrow into the earth and try to find these beings, we would just hit rocks per se?
→ {"text": "而且如果我們試著，比如說在我們過去的第三密度時間線中，即使是一百年前，如果我們試著挖進地球並試圖找到這些存有，我們就只會碰到岩石本身嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

157. You would not really have the contact except in the cases of those spontaneous moments of openness, where you're actually not digging, so to speak, but you're open to the contact.
→ {"text": "你不會真正有接觸，除非在那些自發的開放時刻的情況下，可以說，你實際上不是在挖掘，而是對接觸保持開放。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. So when Admiral Bird flew over the North Pole and saw the big hole and in, you know, then we have all these lores of and stories of journey to the center of the earth.
→ {"text": "所以當伯德將軍飛越北極並看到那個大洞時，你知道，然後我們就有了所有這些關於地心之旅的傳說和故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

159. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. You know these these sorts of stories.
→ {"text": "你知道這些這類的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

161. Yes So that was just because the heart space was in the right space to go into that.
→ {"text": "是的，所以那只是因為心靈空間處於正確的空間來進入那個狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

162. And the timing and many many things...
→ {"text": "而且時機和許多許多事情⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Nexus point of timelines many things, but not necessarily repeatable.
→ {"text": "時間線的匯合點、許多事情，但不一定可重複。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

164. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. Once the ego gets involved, yes?
→ {"text": "一旦小我介入，是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

166. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. Do you guys interact with those 4th density beings?
→ {"text": "你們與那些第四密度存有互動嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

168. Yes there are certain ones that we do because, you know, humans this is not aimed at you of course, but humans have a tendency of thinking they are the only things walking the earth, yes?
→ {"text": "是的，有某些我們確實會互動的，因為，你知道，人類，這當然不是針對你，但人類有一種傾向認為他們是唯一行走在地球上的存有，是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

169. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. But the earth is quite populated on many levels of other dimensions, and in the ancient times because there were so many beings on the planet, and during the times when those groups left, many stayed behind and began to build their own colonies.
→ {"text": "但地球在其他維度的許多層面上都相當密集，而且在古代，因為地球上有這麼多存有，而在那些群體離開的時期，許多存有留了下來並開始建立他們自己的殖民地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. So you have especially one very populated colony is what we would call Sirians, ancient Sirians that stayed and experience their ascension process here...
→ {"text": "所以你特別有一個非常密集的殖民地，我們會稱之為天狼星人，古代天狼星人留下來並在這裡體驗他們的揚升過程⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

172. Oh, wow... ... on your planet.
→ {"text": "哦，哇⋯⋯⋯⋯在你們的星球上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. And very often they're seen as blue.
→ {"text": "而且他們經常被看作是藍色的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

174. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. And on one... so on a specific density reality they're there.  Yes.  And they...
→ {"text": "而且在一個⋯⋯所以在一個特定密度實相上他們在那裡。是的。而且他們⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

176. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

177. And they... do they coexist with us?
→ {"text": "而且他們⋯⋯他們與我們共存嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

178. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

179. They do?
→ {"text": "他們真的共存？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

180. Yes, and when you are in the space in your consciousness to connect with them you most certainly can.
→ {"text": "是的，而且當你的意識處於可以與他們連結的空間時，你絕對可以做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. We've spoke to many who have.
→ {"text": "我們已經與許多有過這種連結的人交談過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

182. Okay, and do you work with them?
→ {"text": "好的，那你們與他們合作嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

183. Sometimes, yes.
→ {"text": "有時候，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

184. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. Especially when we're doing contact work in areas where they are active and they actually tend to be active in seismically active places.
→ {"text": "特別是當我們在他們活躍的地區進行接觸工作時，而且他們實際上傾向於在地震活躍的地方活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

186. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

187. Volcanic areas.
→ {"text": "火山地區。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

188. So their origin is Sirius, but then they migrated to Earth at some point in our history?
→ {"text": "所以他們的起源是天狼星，但後來他們在我們歷史的某個時刻遷移到地球？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

189. Their ancestors came here when the Sirians were here and some of them stayed.
→ {"text": "他們的祖先在天狼星人在這裡的時候來到這裡，而其中一些人留了下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. Some of them also... now of course in the cosmology that we've presented, the Sirian beings, the Orion beings, the Zeta beings, they all come from Vega lineage.
→ {"text": "他們中的一些人也⋯⋯現在當然在我們呈現的宇宙學中，天狼星存有、獵戶座存有、齊塔存有，他們都來自織女星血統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

191. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. So the very, very ancient Vegas who colonized Mars, also some stayed behind came to Earth as well, so that's why we say there's a mix.
→ {"text": "所以那些殖民火星的非常、非常古老的織女星人，也有一些留下來，也來到地球，所以這就是為什麼我們說有混合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

193. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. So is Vega sort of our elders?
→ {"text": "所以織女星某種程度上是我們的長者？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

195. Yes...
→ {"text": "是的⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

196. In that sense?
→ {"text": "在那個意義上？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

197. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

198. What is most known in your galactic family is what we call Vegan Mysticism, which is a school of spirituality that was birthed in Vega millions and millions and millions of years ago, that passed to the different civilizations in your galactic family and also seeded on Earth.
→ {"text": "在你們的銀河家族中最為人所知的，是我們稱之為織女星神秘學的東西，那是一個在數百萬、數百萬、數百萬年前誕生於織女星的靈性學派，傳遞給你們銀河家族中的不同文明，也播種在地球上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. So the seeds of it on Earth most specifically you see within some of the ancient Sanskrit and Hindu times.
→ {"text": "所以它在地球上的種子，最具體地說，你可以在一些古代梵文和印度教時代中看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

200. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And various seeds around the world so it's quite prolific, Vegan Mysticism.
→ {"text": "而且在世界各地有各種種子，所以織女星神秘學相當多產。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. And do... going back to the Sirians, did they...?
→ {"text": "而且⋯⋯回到天狼星人，他們有沒有⋯⋯？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. Were they around during the time of Atlantis?
→ {"text": "他們在亞特蘭提斯時期就在這裡嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. The ones that stayed here on Earth?
→ {"text": "那些留在地球上的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

205. Yes, they were.
→ {"text": "是的，他們在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And so Atlantis... was Atlantis...
→ {"text": "那麼亞特蘭提斯⋯⋯亞特蘭提斯是⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. I assume it was a mixed density bag of tricks?
→ {"text": "我假設它是一個混合密度的各種狀況？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

208. Yes, mixed density bag and mixed density... Sorry, and mixed... >>Races?  >>No, a mixed drama going on.
→ {"text": "是的，混合密度狀況，還有混合密度⋯⋯抱歉，還有混合⋯⋯ >>種族？ >>不，是混合的劇情在進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

209. Okay, lots of things going on.
→ {"text": "好的，很多事情在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

210. Lots of things going on, and all of us, most of us I guess humans have had experiences from or simultaneous lifetimes there...
→ {"text": "很多事情在發生，而且我們所有人，我想我們大部分人類都有來自那裡的經驗，或在那裡的平行生命⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

211. Yes...
→ {"text": "是的⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

212. That we're working through that karma now?
→ {"text": "我們現在正在處理那個業力？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

213. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

214. And so the Sirians were there and they... and then that sort of event happened, cataclysms things like this?
→ {"text": "那麼天狼星人在那裡，而他們⋯⋯然後那種事件發生了，大災變之類的事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

215. All sorts of things.
→ {"text": "各種各樣的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

216. And if it happened in 3rd density reality did it also happen in these other...?
→ {"text": "而且如果它發生在第三密度實相中，它也發生在這些其他⋯⋯？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. If if there's mixed densities interacting with each other did it happen across the density board, the cataclysms, the destruction?
→ {"text": "如果，如果有混合密度彼此互動，這些災變、破壞是否發生在整個密度層面？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

218. Ah, we see what you're asking. Well when we say "mixed densities" we have to define that.
→ {"text": "啊，我們明白你在問什麼。嗯，當我們說「混合密度」時，我們必須定義那個概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

219. Okay
→ {"text": "好的", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

220. Right now on Earth you have mixed densities, even though it's not... you don't see it.
→ {"text": "現在在地球上你們有混合密度，即使它不是⋯⋯你們看不到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

221. Yeah no, we do, we have the, the low end of the 3rd, and the high end of the 3rd, and the low end of the 4th.
→ {"text": "是的不，我們看得到，我們有第三密度的低端、第三密度的高端，還有第四密度的低端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

222. Exactly and even... and you have 5th density versions of yourselves and 6th because again it's the concentric... it's the boxes, the concentric nesting boxes.
→ {"text": "正是如此，甚至⋯⋯而且你們有第五密度版本的自己和第六密度，因為再次說明，它是同心的⋯⋯它是盒子，同心的嵌套盒子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. So in the Atlantean time, physically speaking you did have a mix of 3rd and 4th density beings in a sense populating the same space-time, but you also had the other non-physical influences as well, so...
→ {"text": "所以在亞特蘭提斯時期，從物質上來說，你們確實在某種意義上有第三和第四密度存有的混合，居住在同一個時空中，但你們也有其他非物質的影響，所以⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. And lots of different dramas because everyone was playing out whatever it was they needed to play out for their own evolution.  So it was one of those nexus points of evolution that were very important to, let's say, show you the trajectory for the next phase of your evolution.
→ {"text": "而且有許多不同的劇情，因為每個人都在演出他們自己進化所需要演出的任何東西。所以它是那些進化的匯合點之一，非常重要的匯合點，可以說，向你們展示你們進化下一階段的軌跡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. Because you could have, as a species, shifted at that time.
→ {"text": "因為你們作為一個物種，本來可以在那個時候轉換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
