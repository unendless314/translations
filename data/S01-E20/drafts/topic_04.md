## Speaker Group 85

147. There's a lot of talk about inner earth beings, especially recently, it's sort of been in the consciousness, there's been a whistleblower who's been talking about interaction with inner earth beings and we're finding out this new history that these beings have been there for millions of years pre-dating humanity and, sort of, staying low key.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Now, are they, those beings 4th density beings? 3rd, 4th density beings or...?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

149. Mostly 4th density beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

150. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. There are some that are 5th density so they're not necessarily perceived as solid objects in space, but as light energy, and they're much like what we said about the Anunnaki, they're really a collective, a collective of races.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

152. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. So yes, so there's many different races... in the inner earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

154. Yes And because at different densities, different frequencies, if for example, are we only now able to perceive them because we're shifting into this fourth density?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

155. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

156. And if we were to try let's say in our past timelines of 3rd density,  even a hundred years ago, if we were to try to burrow into the earth and try to find these beings, we would just hit rocks per se?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

157. You would not really have the contact except in the cases of those spontaneous moments of openness, where you're actually not digging, so to speak, but you're open to the contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. So when Admiral Bird flew over the North Pole and saw the big hole and in, you know, then we have all these lores of and stories of journey to the center of the earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

159. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. You know these these sorts of stories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

161. Yes So that was just because the heart space was in the right space to go into that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

162. And the timing and many many things...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Nexus point of timelines many things, but not necessarily repeatable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

164. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Once the ego gets involved, yes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

166. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. Do you guys interact with those 4th density beings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

168. Yes there are certain ones that we do because, you know, humans this is not aimed at you of course, but humans have a tendency of thinking they are the only things walking the earth, yes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

169. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. But the earth is quite populated on many levels of other dimensions, and in the ancient times because there were so many beings on the planet, and during the times when those groups left, many stayed behind and began to build their own colonies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. So you have especially one very populated colony is what we would call Sirians, ancient Sirians that stayed and experience their ascension process here...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

172. Oh, wow... ... on your planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And very often they're seen as blue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

174. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. And on one... so on a specific density reality they're there.  Yes.  And they...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

176. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

177. And they... do they coexist with us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

178. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

179. They do?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

180. Yes, and when you are in the space in your consciousness to connect with them you most certainly can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. We've spoke to many who have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

182. Okay, and do you work with them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

183. Sometimes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

184. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Especially when we're doing contact work in areas where they are active and they actually tend to be active in seismically active places.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

186. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

187. Volcanic areas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

188. So their origin is Sirius, but then they migrated to Earth at some point in our history?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

189. Their ancestors came here when the Sirians were here and some of them stayed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Some of them also... now of course in the cosmology that we've presented, the Sirian beings, the Orion beings, the Zeta beings, they all come from Vega lineage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

191. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. So the very, very ancient Vegas who colonized Mars, also some stayed behind came to Earth as well, so that's why we say there's a mix.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

193. I see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. So is Vega sort of our elders?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

195. Yes...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

196. In that sense?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

197. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

198. What is most known in your galactic family is what we call Vegan Mysticism, which is a school of spirituality that was birthed in Vega millions and millions and millions of years ago, that passed to the different civilizations in your galactic family and also seeded on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. So the seeds of it on Earth most specifically you see within some of the ancient Sanskrit and Hindu times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

200. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. And various seeds around the world so it's quite prolific, Vegan Mysticism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. And do... going back to the Sirians, did they...?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Were they around during the time of Atlantis?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. The ones that stayed here on Earth?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

205. Yes, they were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. And so Atlantis... was Atlantis...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. I assume it was a mixed density bag of tricks?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

208. Yes, mixed density bag and mixed density... Sorry, and mixed... >>Races?  >>No, a mixed drama going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

209. Okay, lots of things going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

210. Lots of things going on, and all of us, most of us I guess humans have had experiences from or simultaneous lifetimes there...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

211. Yes...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

212. That we're working through that karma now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

213. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

214. And so the Sirians were there and they... and then that sort of event happened, cataclysms things like this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

215. All sorts of things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

216. And if it happened in 3rd density reality did it also happen in these other...?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. If if there's mixed densities interacting with each other did it happen across the density board, the cataclysms, the destruction?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

218. Ah, we see what you're asking. Well when we say "mixed densities" we have to define that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

219. Okay
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

220. Right now on Earth you have mixed densities, even though it's not... you don't see it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

221. Yeah no, we do, we have the, the low end of the 3rd, and the high end of the 3rd, and the low end of the 4th.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

222. Exactly and even... and you have 5th density versions of yourselves and 6th because again it's the concentric... it's the boxes, the concentric nesting boxes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. So in the Atlantean time, physically speaking you did have a mix of 3rd and 4th density beings in a sense populating the same space-time, but you also had the other non-physical influences as well, so...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. And lots of different dramas because everyone was playing out whatever it was they needed to play out for their own evolution.  So it was one of those nexus points of evolution that were very important to, let's say, show you the trajectory for the next phase of your evolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. Because you could have, as a species, shifted at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
