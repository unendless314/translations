→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 324

546. Oh, there's so more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. I know I could go on forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. But I want to honor everybody's time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. And we've got lots of great stuff to share here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. So thank you so much for everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. I'll leave it open just for one last thing, if Sasha wants to share anything for me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. I've heard that maybe--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 325

553. My brother.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 326

555. I heard that-- I heard that earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. So--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 327

557. There is another you in my time stream, my dear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. And he is much more flamboyant than you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. It's a he.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

560. Flamboyant?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

561. Flamboyant, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. In a-- we don't-- maybe not what you're imagining.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

563. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

564. He doesn't wear rainbow streamers or anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

565. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

566. But he's very excited and gregarious, even more than you are as a human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. And whenever he-- he's involved a lot in some of the contact work, in general, introducing planets-- new planets to the galactic community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. And whenever he is present, he, let's say, lightens the mood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. Not that it's ever a somber mood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 334

570. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 335

571. But it's always he's always a welcome invite to a party, let's say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 336

572. Excellent, excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

573. So just tap into that and see what you can get.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

574. I would-- I always love parties.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

575. Excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 340

576. And lightening the mood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. So that's very much so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. I resonate with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. Does he have a name?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

580. Let's see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. Again, of course, it would have to be translated into an English concept.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

582. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

583. No, of course.

## Speaker Group 344

585. Oh.

## Speaker Group 346

587. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 347

588. We have the first two syllables.

589. Just a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. HARUKI
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 348

591. Oh, very nice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. Nice to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 349

593. Recognizing that that is not really his name, much as Sasha is not my name.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 350

594. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 351

596. But energetically--

## Speaker Group 357

604. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 358

606. And then, for now, we wish you much-- first of all, much excitement on your journey and good luck with the project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 359

607. Thank you.

## Speaker Group 361

610. Holy crap.
