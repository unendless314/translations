  source_text: What motivates relating? What motivates that ability to relate to another
    person? that is sort of this desire to 'see' and to be seen. open up and have
    a sense of that openness so that others can see you.

    text: 是什麼驅使我們建立連結？是什麼促成與他人產生關係的能力？那是一種「看見」與被看見的渴望。敞開自己，擁有那種讓他人能看見你的開放感。
