wasn't like an odd thing."},{"segment_id":48,"speaker_group":8,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":49,"speaker_group":9,"source_text":"And so that really helped me learn to communicate with

beings."},{"segment_id":52,"speaker_group":9,"source_text":"And that's when things, I think, got kind of weird for people."},{"segment_id":53,"speaker_group":9,"source_text":"Like, oh, we're having other-dimensional communication."},{"segment_id":54,"speaker_group":10,"source_text":"So at the time were you still hardcore Mormon?"},{"segment_id":55,"speaker_group":11,"source_text":"I was

people."},{"segment_id":61,"speaker_group":15,"source_text":"Like, when their passed grandmothers were coming to me, or even if their mother had passed and they were giving me messages, I felt like it was too much for me to say, hey, I can hear your grandma as well."},{"segment_id":62,"speaker_group":15,"source_text":"This is what she's saying."},{"segment_id":63,"speaker_group":15,"source_text":"But if I get the message from my own grandma, it wasn't so weird."},{"segment_id":64,"speaker_group":16,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":65,"speaker_group":16,"source_text":"So people-- because I guess some may feel a little intrusive then if they were given those messages?"},{"segment_id":66,"speaker_group":17,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":67,"speaker_group":17,"source_text":"And maybe they feel like, well that's my grandma."},{"segment_id":68,"speaker_group":17,"source_text":"She should be communicating with me only."},{"segment_id":69,"speaker_group":18,"source_text":"Oh, I see."},{"segment_id":70,"speaker_group":19,"source_text":"And then that's the funny thing that I learned with being a channeler and a medium, is when you open yourself up to, any spirit can communicate with you and give messages of healing, if they feel like you're going to listen."},{"segment_id":71,"speaker_group":19,"source_text":"And other people close themselves off to it sometimes."},{"segment_id":72,"speaker_group":20,"source_text":"Well, don't you have to get permission from-- or you get permission from their family members, from the other

much."},{"segment_id":75,"speaker_group":22,"source_text":"They're just like, hey, someone here can understand me."},{"segment_id":76,"speaker_group":22,"source_text":"Let me communicate to you, for example, to convey that message."},{"segment_id":77,"speaker_group":23,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":78,"speaker_group":24,"source_text":"And I guess when other people-- I was going to ask, is when some of the information coming through is spot on or accurate, does that sort of freak them out a little bit?"},{"segment_id":79,"speaker_group":25,"source_text":"Yeah, that's when they're they come up with the logical excuses."},{"segment_id":80,"speaker_group":25,"source_text":"Well, you probably know that because of this, or things like that."},{"segment_id":81,"speaker_group":25,"source_text":"I think it does make them a little like, how would she know that?"},{"segment_id":82,"speaker_group":25,"source_text":"That's nerve wracking."},{"segment_id":83,"speaker_group":25,"source_text":"So my logical mind will step in and try to make sense of it."},{"segment_id":84,"speaker_group":26,"source_text":"Right, right."},{"segment_id":85,"speaker_group":26,"source_text":"Yeah, I've done that a long time ago."},{"segment_id":86,"speaker_group":26,"source_text":"That was-- part of the series was getting to see-- proving for myself whether all of this other side stuff is real or not, or if it's just, you know, are all these people just going on the internet and finding things out about me, and then conveying it?"},{"segment_id":87,"speaker_group":26,"source_text":"But then I'm like, no."},{"segment_id":88,"speaker_group":26,"source_text":"That's not what's happening."},{"segment_id":89,"speaker_group":27,"source_text":"You're like, I don't know."},{"segment_id":90,"speaker_group":27,"source_text":"Yeah, I think that's why spirit just doesn't care, is because they connect to the heart."},{"segment_id":91,"speaker_group":27,"source_text":"And they know that even if the logical mind steps in, that heart space can eventually come through and be like, you know what?"},{"segment_id":92,"speaker_group":27,"source_text":"I feel like this is real."},{"segment_id":93,"speaker_group":28,"source_text":"So you start channeling ETs, or thought communication, I guess."},{"segment_id":94,"speaker_group":28,"source_text":"What was your first communication from the ET realm, or that?"},{"segment_id":95,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"So I would set a daily practice of meditation aside."},{"segment_id":96,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"And that's when I started channeling other beings and things like that."},{"segment_id":97,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"Or I guess spirit beings that I knew as people."},{"segment_id":98,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"And then that's when I started getting visuals of other beings."},{"segment_id":99,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"I had a Reptilian that came that I didn't even know anything about Reptilians or anything at that point."},{"segment_id":100,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"And it kind of was like, that was weird."},{"segment_id":101,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"Did my imagination create a giant lizard guy?"},{"segment_id":102,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"I don't know, it was just a weird-- and then I just saw things that I didn't think that I could create in my mind."},{"segment_id":103,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"Like the Lyran beings-- cats and things."},{"segment_id":104,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"And I decided to look it up on the internet, and there were other people that had had similar experiences, or had visions of the same type of being."},{"segment_id":105,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"So I'm like, maybe this is a real contact."},{"segment_id":106,"speaker_group":29,"source_text":"And that's when I opened myself up more, and I got more of it."},{"segment_id":107,"speaker_group":30,"source_text":"So the first being was a Reptilian."},{"segment_id":108,"speaker_group":30,"source_text":"What did he say?"},{"segment_id":109,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"Well, he had-- it was interesting because he had this cape on."},{"segment_id":110,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"And it looked like he could have put a hood kind of thing."},{"segment_id":111,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"And so I was meditating, and he came through."},{"segment_id":112,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"And I was kind of like, whoa."},{"segment_id":113,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"And then he faded away, and then a Gray came in."},{"segment_id":114,"speaker_group":31,"source_text":"So I don't know if he shapeshifted to make it more something that I felt--"},{"segment_id":115,"speaker_group":32,"source_text":"Like, \"I'm an alien\" kind of thing?"},{"segment_id":116,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"Yeah, I'm just an alien."},{"segment_id":117,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":118,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"But he's told me that he's my guide and protector."},{"segment_id":119,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"And so he's kind of always been there."},{"segment_id":120,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"But initially it was a weird thing for me."},{"segment_id":121,"speaker_group":33,"source_text":"And then I got--"},{"segment_id":122,"speaker_group":34,"source_text":"Does he have a name?"},{"segment_id":123,"speaker_group":35,"source_text":"Does have a name?"},{"segment_id":124,"speaker_group":36,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":125,"speaker_group":37,"source_text":"As far as I can hear, he calls himself-- he says \"Balthazar,\" is how he says it."},{"segment_id":126,"speaker_group":38,"source_text":"Do you know what realm of Reptilians?"},{"segment_id":127,"speaker_group":38,"source_text":"Because there's so many."},{"segment_id":128,"speaker_group":39,"source_text":"Well, he says he's with the Alpha Draconis."},{"segment_id":129,"speaker_group":39,"source_text":"But he often works with the Council of Beings, which can be Pleiade or from all over, basically, to help humanity."},{"segment_id":130,"speaker_group":40,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":131,"speaker_group":40,"source_text":"So for those who are watching, there are Alpha Draconians that are actually helping, as opposed to being all-- because a common misconception, I guess, would be that all the Reptilians are bad."},{"segment_id":132,"speaker_group":40,"source_text":"A lot of people who subscribe to this information are like, oh, Reptilian, stay back."},{"segment_id":133,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":134,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And with that, I'll Alpha Draconis is mainly just a star system."},{"segment_id":135,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"So it's like Pleiades star system."},{"segment_id":136,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And you're going to have benevolent beings, and you're going to have those that are in favor of humanity's evolution."},{"segment_id":137,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And that's the same with the Draconis."},{"segment_id":138,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"They have a lot of evolved beings that are in service of humanity now, even though maybe at one point they hadn't been."},{"segment_id":139,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And there are still those break-offs in that star system that are heavily domineering."},{"segment_id":140,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And then there's also the species that stay within Earth that are lower realms of Reptilian that I would say are more of the dangerous because they're not evolved."},{"segment_id":141,"speaker_group":41,"source_text":"And they wish to stay in Fourth Density."},{"segment_id":142,"speaker_group":42,"source_text":"So all this information that you just described, this is all just coming through these different interactions with these different beings?"},{"segment_id":143,"speaker_group":43,"source_text":"Yeah, or just through channelings that I've done for individuals and, I guess, more public."},{"segment_id":144,"speaker_group":44,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":145,"speaker_group":44,"source_text":"Well, when I first discovered your work, I was blown away on how correlating it was with all the other stuff I've been doing, interviewing others."},{"segment_id":146,"speaker_group":44,"source_text":"And you haven't been doing this that long, right?"},{"segment_id":147,"speaker_group":44,"source_text":"It's only been this past year or two?"},{"segment_id":148,"speaker_group":45,"source_text":"Maybe a year and a half."},{"segment_id":149,"speaker_group":46,"source_text":"A year and a half. >> Maybe, yeah."},{"segment_id":150,"speaker_group":47,"source_text":"Wow."},{"segment_id":151,"speaker_group":47,"source_text":"And I was blown away by the in-depthness of some of the channelings and the information coming through that, again, just correlates with everything I've been studying for the past 10 years."},{"segment_id":152,"speaker_group":48,"source_text":"Good, I'm glad I'm not way off."},{"segment_id":153,"speaker_group":49,"source_text":"No, no."},{"segment_id":154,"speaker_group":49,"source_text":"You're right on track, which is why I'm here, and we're doing this."},{"segment_id":155,"speaker_group":49,"source_text":"So after the Reptilian encounter, shapeshifting into a Gray, what other sort of beings came through?"},{"segment_id":156,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"There was a Gray and a Mantis that came through after I was resisting a while on my path and things."},{"segment_id":157,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And I don't know if the Gray was the Reptilian in disguise."},{"segment_id":158,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"I don't know."},{"segment_id":159,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"There was a lot of language that sounded like ancient Egyptian, and spoke of like choosing me to be the channeler for information, and things like that."},{"segment_id":160,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And so that's when I basically started taking things more seriously."},{"segment_id":161,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And there was another very vivid contact where I was actually on the couch here."},{"segment_id":162,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"I had fallen asleep one night."},{"segment_id":163,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And a Draconis being came."},{"segment_id":164,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And he looked like a giant bat."},{"segment_id":165,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"It was so intense."},{"segment_id":166,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"He had the wings."},{"segment_id":167,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"It was dark."},{"segment_id":168,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And I had-- it felt like a lower dimensional being standing to the side of me."},{"segment_id":169,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"I couldn't get a glimpse of what it looked like."},{"segment_id":170,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"But it was cursing me out."},{"segment_id":171,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"And the Draconis was like, basically, surrender to your path."},{"segment_id":172,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"Let go of the old ideas, because at the time I was having a hard time transitioning."},{"segment_id":173,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"But he did it in such a-- I don't want to say dark way, because it benefited me to understand that I need to get serious."},{"segment_id":174,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"But it was dark energy."},{"segment_id":175,"speaker_group":50,"source_text":"It was just a very intense-- I mean, he was basically like-- the way he stood, his presence, everything was just very interesting."},{"segment_id":176,"speaker_group":51,"source_text":"This was the bat being?"},{"segment_id":177,"speaker_group":51,"source_text":"The bat?"},{"segment_id":178,"speaker_group":52,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":179,"speaker_group":53,"source_text":"But you said there was another lower being at the same time that was yelling at you?"},{"segment_id":180,"speaker_group":54,"source_text":"Mm-hmm."},{"segment_id":181,"speaker_group":55,"source_text":"And he was yelling at you as well?"},{"segment_id":182,"speaker_group":56,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":183,"speaker_group":56,"source_text":"The bat being-- I actually woke up and was like, why is there a bat man in my room?"},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":56,"source_text":"Because it felt so-- or not in my room, but next to me, because it felt so much like a bat man."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":57,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":58,"source_text":"But then the lower dimensional being was the one that's cursing me out."},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":58,"source_text":"The other one--"},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":59,"source_text":"So the other one was just there."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":60,"source_text":"He was there, and he basically communicated in a very dignified way."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":60,"source_text":"But it was a very powerful way."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":60,"source_text":"Like, to the point where you'd want to listen."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":60,"source_text":"But everything just felt very intense."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":61,"source_text":"Have you made sense of that since?"},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":61,"source_text":"Why the two beings-- two different beings, and at the same time."},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":61,"source_text":"One is doing the-- you know."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":62,"source_text":"Basically, from what I understand-- I don't know if this is 100%."},{"segment_id":197,"speaker_group":62,"source_text":"But because my vibration had to rise so much to communicate to this other Draconis being-- because I could almost see him."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":62,"source_text":"There was no third dimension, where I was at."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":62,"source_text":"I had to slip through the fourth dimension."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":62,"source_text":"And so I was able to interact with fourth-dimensional beings that were trying to, I guess, take me down or communicate negative emotions to me, things like that."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":63,"source_text":"So when you open yourself up as a channel, then it can be negative, positive?"},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":63,"source_text":"Everybody's trying to get to you in a way."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":64,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":65,"source_text":"To communicate through, or to-- what do you think the purposes are?"},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"I don't think they like when there's light being brought into the soul."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"I feel like there's a lot of emotions that they can gain when things stay in low dimensions."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"Low density."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"And during the time when I was starting channeling, I didn't know how to block myself, or how to set the tone, I guess."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"My intention."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"And I got a lot of low dimensions coming in."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"And I just don't think they like it."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":66,"source_text":"I don't think they like you shedding light and love to people and letting them know their power."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":67,"source_text":"And I guess if you are going to, and they can see you as being a conduit, then, well, maybe they can use that energy."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":67,"source_text":"Or use you as the conduit for their energy instead."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":68,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":69,"source_text":"So having both channelings of-- I try to guide more to the positive, and empowering messages."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":69,"source_text":"But I guess in the same sense you can have people channeling the bad stuff."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":69,"source_text":"Negative energy and disempowering information."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"Well, and it's kind of like where our world is at today."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"There's a lot of powerful people that know ancient knowledge."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"They know about those things."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"And instead of using it for good, they've used it for evil."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"So it's like if I can tap into that, can they get me to use it for evil purposes or whatever the case is, like they've always been able to do?"},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":70,"source_text":"Or can we transmute that and use it for collective of humanity's evolution?"},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":71,"source_text":"Right, right."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":71,"source_text":"When did you go public with all of this?"},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":71,"source_text":"When did you decide to share this gift?"},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":72,"source_text":"Share the gift!"},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":72,"source_text":"So I woke up one morning, and I had this burning sensation-- yearning or whatever-- to channel Princess Diana publicly and post it on YouTube."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":72,"source_text":"And it was just something that I just knew I had to do."},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":73,"source_text":"Was she already coming through?"},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":74,"source_text":"She had been coming through."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":74,"source_text":"Not quite like I did on the video."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":74,"source_text":"That was pretty long and intense."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":74,"source_text":"So."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":75,"source_text":"I don't think I saw that one."},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":75,"source_text":"Can you just give us a little sneak?"},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":76,"source_text":"It was very emotional."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":76,"source_text":"It was the first time I ever really did a long period of channeling."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":76,"source_text":"And she basically got into some deep issues."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":76,"source_text":"And yeah, that's basically how I started on the YouTube and decided whoever comes, I will channel you and make it public."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":76,"source_text":"And that's kind of how it went."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":77,"source_text":"And what was the reaction when you put that up?"},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":77,"source_text":"How did people respond?"},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":78,"source_text":"Actually, fairly well."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":78,"source_text":"People really enjoyed it."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":79,"source_text":"And then that propelled you to keep doing this?"},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":80,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":80,"source_text":"And then I started getting more and more people's deceased loved ones coming to me."},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":80,"source_text":"And that's when I decided to do private channelings on my own."},{"segment_id":251,"speaker_group":80,"source_text":"And so it just kind of took off from there."},{"segment_id":252,"speaker_group":81,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":253,"speaker_group":81,"source_text":"Being in Salt Lake and in this energy, what's-- because you mentioned earlier people were OK with the grandmother stuff."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":81,"source_text":"But beyond your personal grandmother, when you started going to other grandmothers or other spirits, have you gotten much of a blowback from the community?"},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":82,"source_text":"So I am not very verbal with all of that now."},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":82,"source_text":"I just feel like if people are ready, Spirit will help them find me through the internet or whatever that way."},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":82,"source_text":"I've just had too many just put up walls, and they just don't know how to deal with it."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":82,"source_text":"I do find that women that have their children out of the house, and they're trying to rediscover themselves, they are starting to dabble with this, even if they are in the Mormon church."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":82,"source_text":"So a lot of my clients that I have had from Salt Lake are older women."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":83,"source_text":"When you say children out of the house, like, grown up and out?"},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":84,"source_text":"Yeah. >> Is that what you mean?"},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"And they kind of are just like, I've gone to church for years."},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"Had the same lessons over and over."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"What else is there?"},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"The kids are out of the house."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"So they'll start to explore these things, and they're more open to it."},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"And it's the ones that are having their little kids, their kids that they're trying to get into church zone."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":85,"source_text":"And there's still a little bit unsure what to bring into their family life, and even themselves."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"Right, right."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"And probably being conditioned since birth, right?"},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":86,"source_text":"So they're probably still a little scared to go outside of what they know."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":87,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"So, well, hopefully that'll be changing."},{"segment_id":275,"speaker_group":88,"source_text":"It seems like it is."},{"segment_id":276,"speaker_group":89,"source_text":"Yes, I'm really hoping."},{"segment_id":277,"speaker_group":90,"source_text":"I've done a little research on the Mormon religion."},{"segment_id":278,"speaker_group":90,"source_text":"But for those who aren't too familiar, I'm guessing it's a pretty rigid set of rules in it's belief system?"},{"segment_id":279,"speaker_group":91,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":280,"speaker_group":91,"source_text":"I mean, it's not just a religion."},{"segment_id":281,"speaker_group":91,"source_text":"It's like you change your whole life and culture, almost like Islamic."},{"segment_id":282,"speaker_group":91,"source_text":"You change everything about how you live, your interactions with people--"},{"segment_id":283,"speaker_group":92,"source_text":"In what ways could you go into?"},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":93,"source_text":"Well, so you don't drink."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":93,"source_text":"There are a lot of regulations with-- I guess just how you live your life."},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":94,"source_text":"Well, not drinking, that could be a positive thing."},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"It is a positive thing, yeah, because it can-- it's fun."},{"segment_id":288,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"It's really fun to drink every once in a while."},{"segment_id":289,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"But it can bring your vibration to a low state."},{"segment_id":290,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"And you can't think very clearly."},{"segment_id":291,"speaker_group":95,"source_text":"So there's something to that."},{"segment_id":292,"speaker_group":96,"source_text":"I was recently in Kuwait, and it's illegal-- alcohol is illegal there."},{"segment_id":293,"speaker_group":97,"source_text":"Oh, really?"},{"segment_id":294,"speaker_group":98,"source_text":"Yeah, they don't have it at all."},{"segment_id":295,"speaker_group":98,"source_text":"So I thought, oh, that's actually good to know."},{"segment_id":296,"speaker_group":98,"source_text":"There's nothing wrong with that."},{"segment_id":297,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":298,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"The thing is, though, I think with kids being told, like, we don't do that."},{"segment_id":299,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"It's a rule."},{"segment_id":300,"speaker_group":99,"source_text":"Then they get more intrigued, and then they take it to a whole other level."},{"segment_id":301,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":302,"speaker_group":100,"source_text":"Overcompensation because of the--"},{"segment_id":303,"speaker_group":101,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":304,"speaker_group":102,"source_text":"--suppression."},{"segment_id":305,"speaker_group":103,"source_text":"I think sexual-- one thing when you said suppression, I think the sexual side of how we are in our culture is also another lifestyle that is unhealthy."},{"segment_id":306,"speaker_group":103,"source_text":"And just the way that we live."},{"segment_id":307,"speaker_group":104,"source_text":"And is that-- because I know the multiple wives thing, that's sort of-- how does that work?"},{"segment_id":308,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"So that is a break-off from the Mormon church."},{"segment_id":309,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"So we were-- I say we because I've been a part of it for so long."},{"segment_id":310,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"But I don't go to the church anymore."},{"segment_id":311,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"But the Mormon church was polygamist."},{"segment_id":312,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"The government was getting at them."},{"segment_id":313,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"And so they said, OK, we're not."},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"But another side said, well, we still want to be."},{"segment_id":315,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"So they broke off, and they still do."},{"segment_id":316,"speaker_group":105,"source_text":"And they call the FLDS, or a fundamentalist."},{"segment_id":317,"speaker_group":106,"source_text":"OK, so there's different divisions within the Mormon--"},{"segment_id":318,"speaker_group":107,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":319,"speaker_group":108,"source_text":"See, I didn't even know that."},{"segment_id":320,"speaker_group":108,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":321,"speaker_group":109,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":322,"speaker_group":110,"source_text":"And so overall, basically, the polygamy is not so much?"},{"segment_id":323,"speaker_group":111,"source_text":"No, not in the main Mormon church, no."},{"segment_id":324,"speaker_group":112,"source_text":"Because I've seen some TV shows of--"},{"segment_id":325,"speaker_group":113,"source_text":"Oh, like--"},{"segment_id":326,"speaker_group":114,"source_text":"Where they go into the lives of--"},{"segment_id":327,"speaker_group":115,"source_text":"\"Sister Wives\" and-- yeah."},{"segment_id":328,"speaker_group":116,"source_text":"Yeah, and just glimpses."},{"segment_id":329,"speaker_group":116,"source_text":"And I'm like, oh, that's interesting."},{"segment_id":330,"speaker_group":117,"source_text":"Well, they believe pretty much a lot of the same stuff."},{"segment_id":331,"speaker_group":117,"source_text":"It's just the polygamy that's been altered that we have taken out because we were getting so much from the government."},{"segment_id":332,"speaker_group":118,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":333,"speaker_group":119,"source_text":"So getting back to the ET stuff, you mentioned channeling a Zeta and-- was it channeling, or connecting with a Zeta and a Mantis?"},{"segment_id":334,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"Well, I guess it would be more of like a contact experience."},{"segment_id":335,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"They came to me and just talked to me."},{"segment_id":336,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"And my vibration had to be raised so much that I didn't feel like I could even move."},{"segment_id":337,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"I was basically thrown down-- not thrown down by them."},{"segment_id":338,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"But my energy felt so transitioned that I laid down on the couch."},{"segment_id":339,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"And then they came over me."},{"segment_id":340,"speaker_group":120,"source_text":"And it just took a while for me to even gain my energy back."},{"segment_id":341,"speaker_group":121,"source_text":"Because I've been exploring my own personal connections with both Zeta and Mantis, could I ask what it felt like?"},{"segment_id":342,"speaker_group":121,"source_text":"What did you--"},{"segment_id":343,"speaker_group":122,"source_text":"I felt like I was in a dizzy tunnel."},{"segment_id":344,"speaker_group":123,"source_text":"Were they coming at the same time?"},{"segment_id":345,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"They came at the same time, together."},{"segment_id":346,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"They came together, and kind of came toward me and spoke to me."},{"segment_id":347,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"I felt like the Mantis was doing something with my energy to raise it enough where I would understand, almost like they were speaking directly to me, like we are."},{"segment_id":348,"speaker_group":124,"source_text":"But obviously there were no words."},{"segment_id":349,"speaker_group":125,"source_text":"The Gray was?"},{"segment_id":350,"speaker_group":126,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":351,"speaker_group":126,"source_text":"The Gray was speaking, and I could understand it, almost like you and I were talking."},{"segment_id":352,"speaker_group":127,"source_text":"So the Mantis was more of a facilitator."},{"segment_id":353,"speaker_group":128,"source_text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"segment_id":354,"speaker_group":129,"source_text":"Just sort of being there."},{"segment_id":355,"speaker_group":130,"source_text":"It felt like it was doing something with my energy to raise it to a certain degree where I could understand that."},{"segment_id":356,"speaker_group":131,"source_text":"And what did they say?"},{"segment_id":357,"speaker_group":132,"source_text":"It was--"},{"segment_id":358,"speaker_group":133,"source_text":"Or what did the Zeta say?"},{"segment_id":359,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"OK, so it said, basically, you need to do your path."},{"segment_id":360,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"You've been chosen for this."},{"segment_id":361,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"And then they said all this stuff in, like, Egyptian that I-- I think they thought that maybe it would click or something."},{"segment_id":362,"speaker_group":134,"source_text":"But I just didn't--"},{"segment_id":363,"speaker_group":135,"source_text":"Well, what did it feel like?"},{"segment_id":364,"speaker_group":136,"source_text":"It felt like ancient information that you need to reintroduce back into the human consciousness."},{"segment_id":365,"speaker_group":137,"source_text":"Do you have an idea of what that is?"},{"segment_id":366,"speaker_group":138,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":367,"speaker_group":138,"source_text":"So since then, I've done meditations and clarified it, and it always goes back to the Egyptian times."},{"segment_id":368,"speaker_group":139,"source_text":"Which is-- what are those messages, generally?"},{"segment_id":369,"speaker_group":140,"source_text":"So there's a lot."},{"segment_id":370,"speaker_group":140,"source_text":"[CHUCKLES]"},{"segment_id":371,"speaker_group":141,"source_text":"Just the short version."},{"segment_id":372,"speaker_group":142,"source_text":"I think the biggest thing for that time period was there were beings on the planet."},{"segment_id":373,"speaker_group":143,"source_text":"Already interacting with humanity."},{"segment_id":374,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":375,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And when I go back into my meditations, they show me that there are extraterrestrials all over the place that are in control of different paradigms of the social structures."},{"segment_id":376,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And somewhere along the lines, most particularly probably the Roman times when the Romans took over, they transitioned it to be more of a three-dimensional world."},{"segment_id":377,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And they sort of faded in the background-- with control still, but we are not able to see them."},{"segment_id":378,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And because of that, we have become unconscious."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And so that's where all the transitions have happened."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And so they just basically want to reintroduce the idea that they've always been here."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"But the fact that-- they kind of say that the cycles of the planet have taken us into a lower dimension, and other beings took advantage of that."},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":144,"source_text":"And so we stayed in three dimension for a while."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":145,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":145,"source_text":"Are you familiar with the density terms?"},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":145,"source_text":"Density levels correlating with chakras?"},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":146,"source_text":"So isn't it the lower is your third, and then it goes up higher to the higher dimension?"},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"Or density dimensions-- this is sort of creating a thesaurus of words to describe these experiences."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"And I like to use the dimensional-- when I use the term \"dimensions,\" I correlate it with actual scientific-- how the scientific community says we're actually in the fourth dimension with X,Y, Z, or up, down, left, right, and spacetime being the fourth dimension for measuring dimensional space and time."},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"And then fifth dimensional concepts and ideas would be getting out of the linear concept."},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"So from A to B, no longer going in that linear sense, but jumping around the spacetime."},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"And that gives a fifth-dimensional perspective on our reality."},{"segment_id":393,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"Where I've noticed with some of the other interviews, and Lyssa Royal and others used the term \"densities\" to describe the actual consciousness."},{"segment_id":394,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"And we're sort of-- they say we're moving from third to fourth density."},{"segment_id":395,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"And I notice these terms kind of get confusing sometimes, as people say 3D, 4D."},{"segment_id":396,"speaker_group":147,"source_text":"So would you say more of the third density, the heaviness of the energy?"},{"segment_id":397,"speaker_group":148,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":398,"speaker_group":149,"source_text":"And then we're moving into fourth density?"},{"segment_id":399,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":400,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"So what I understand with that is we were a fourth density or a fifth dimensional-type being before."},{"segment_id":401,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"And then I guess it was the way that the cycles of the Earth rotated, or however it worked, beings knew this, and came down, and used these paradigms to take and control our fear and structure."},{"segment_id":402,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"And we went down into density."},{"segment_id":403,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"And some of us have stayed here for a while."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":150,"source_text":"And now that the earth has done its cycle rotation, we're able to come out of it."},{"segment_id":405,"speaker_group":151,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":406,"speaker_group":152,"source_text":"Does that seem like it--"},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":153,"source_text":"Matches right with everything, yes."},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":153,"source_text":"Totally."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":153,"source_text":"So the planet itself is it's own higher dimensional density being."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":153,"source_text":"And we as densities-- beings-- on it have to evolve with her."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"That's the perfect way, because people get upset."},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"Like, how could the beings come and do that to our consciousness?"},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"But it's like, we're all doing this together."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"And in a sense, in almost every single one of my channelings, it was basically humanity's choice."},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"We let the fear overcome us."},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"We let that maintain our consciousness."},{"segment_id":418,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"And we just didn't break out of it in time, I guess, for everything to evolve."},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":154,"source_text":"And we stayed with it for a while."},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":155,"source_text":"Yeah, I was hoping later today, in the channeling, we can get into some of the history a little bit more."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":155,"source_text":"Fall of Atlantis, and these cycles, and stuff like that."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":155,"source_text":"And the human evolution."},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":156,"source_text":"Mm-hmm."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":157,"source_text":"I think that was going to be the main focus."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":158,"source_text":"That's good."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":159,"source_text":"Sounds like you've gotten a lot of information on other beings."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":160,"source_text":"I think that's the biggest scope of my path as a channeler, because it can-- each channeler has their things that they focus on."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":160,"source_text":"And I feel like right now that's what they want me to focus on, because this is what was needed, I guess, for this evolution process."},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":161,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":161,"source_text":"And we can always learn from our past."},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":161,"source_text":"Even though we're recreating it in the moment now."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":162,"source_text":"I know, I know."},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":163,"source_text":"Awesome."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":163,"source_text":"So you've connected with all these different beings."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":163,"source_text":"Do you have one being that you normally connect with?"},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":163,"source_text":"Or is it just always random?"},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":164,"source_text":"A lot of times it is like the Council of Light, if it's to do with healing."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":164,"source_text":"If there's something to do with healing."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":164,"source_text":"It's just depending on the question and things like that."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":164,"source_text":"If it's something with origins."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":165,"source_text":"And they call themselves-- is it a collective, the Council of Light?"},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":166,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":166,"source_text":"But they'll visually show me who's stepping forward, usually."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":167,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":167,"source_text":"So within the council, one person of the council will step forward and say, OK, on behalf of the council?"},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":168,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":169,"source_text":"OK, cool."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":170,"source_text":"Especially if that individual, if they know that individual has a specific question about healing, with whatever reason, they know how to answer that question."},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":170,"source_text":"Maybe more than somebody else or whatever."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":171,"source_text":"Interesting."},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":172,"source_text":"But I do feel like, as far as the origins in humanity, it is more like ET and the Draconis that I connect with."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":172,"source_text":"Reptilian type stuff."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":173,"source_text":"When you say the ET, so the Draconis part of the ET stuff?"},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Yeah, but also just other ET beings that maybe are not fully part of the council with healing."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"They just know about humanity, and how things have fit in."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"Such as Lyran beings or things like that."},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":174,"source_text":"They have a lot of wisdom that came with this time period, and so they'll help with that kind of thing, if you're gaining knowledge."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":175,"source_text":"Very cool."},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":175,"source_text":"Do you have a favorite?"},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":176,"source_text":"Well, I like doing the Reptilians and--"},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":177,"source_text":"Yeah?"},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"Yeah, their energy is just so direct."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"And I like that."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"I don't like the fluff of everything."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"Let's just get to the reason why we're here, and let's do it."},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":178,"source_text":"And that's how they are."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":179,"source_text":"Nice, nice."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":179,"source_text":"Very cool."},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":179,"source_text":"Do you think maybe later we can talk to some Reptilians?"},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":179,"source_text":"Let's see if they come through."},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":180,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"That'd be cool."},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"Yeah, my process over this, doing this series, has been learning and categorizing, and learning about these different energies."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"And the Reptilians-- we had one super happy-go-lucky TReb come through Rob Gauthier, a Reptilian."},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"But other than that, I really haven't tapped into too many other-- personally, I've sort of seeked out and seen and connected with."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":181,"source_text":"But I think that would be nice, to introduce--"},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"So have you seen any?"},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":182,"source_text":"Like, in your meditations?"},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":183,"source_text":"Reptilians?"},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":184,"source_text":"Mm-hmm."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":185,"source_text":"No, actually."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":185,"source_text":"Well, I-- kind of."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":185,"source_text":"But not in a communicative sense, where they're creating a rapport of question answers kind of thing."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":185,"source_text":"Just images and feelings."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":186,"source_text":"They just kind of flew by your line of vision."},{"segment_id":487,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"Yeah, sort of Reptilians."},{"segment_id":488,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"And I sort of got one one time during a meditation."},{"segment_id":489,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"I saw this really nasty, dark-- claws and teeth and snouts and all that stuff coming in."},{"segment_id":490,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"And then for a second, for a split second, I was really afraid."},{"segment_id":491,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"But then immediately I was like, well, no, that's super cool."},{"segment_id":492,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"Look at how cool that is, looking at it from the little boy's perspective."},{"segment_id":493,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"Like a \"Jurassic Park\" or something like-- kids love dinosaurs, and playing with that stuff."},{"segment_id":494,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"It's a cool factor."},{"segment_id":495,"speaker_group":187,"source_text":"And as soon as I did that, it shifted, and it turned into a cartoon."},{"segment_id":496,"speaker_group":188,"source_text":"Oh, really?"},{"segment_id":497,"speaker_group":189,"source_text":"And it was kind of like Shrek."},{"segment_id":498,"speaker_group":190,"source_text":"Oh."},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":191,"source_text":"You know how he tries to be the mean giant in front of everybody, but he's just a cuddly Shrek guy."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":192,"source_text":"That's funny."},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"That was the analogy."},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"I was like, it's just about your perspective and how you look at these things."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"Which creates them, right?"},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":193,"source_text":"So in reality, it was just a lovable cartoon puffy dragon thing."},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":194,"source_text":"That is what I've heard that you can transmute what you're seeing into something more lovable or in the light kind of thing."},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"So that was-- and I think that was the lesson, that it was coming through and saying, hey, we're not all scary, nasty-- we can be cool."},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"It's just you guys are so used to perception."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"You're so trained, oh, this is bad, this is good."},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"So if you let go of all that, there's actually something really cool to be seen."},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"And even lovable and happy and good with the Reptilian stuff."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"But conditioning-- even in the New Age community, the conditioning of Reptilians has not been the greatest."},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"They've sort of had, you know, stay away from the Reptilians, or the evil Reptilian government, the Illuminati, and all that."},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"Of course, that faction and those-- they do exist."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"But for us to-- I think it's time for us to embrace all of that side of us."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":195,"source_text":"Because we all have Reptilian in us."},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"Well, as far as I know, there are the ancient Reptilians."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"And then, like I said, there's more the lower dimensional that just want to be in fourth density."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"And they don't want to evolve right now."},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"And those are the ones that are kind of like, OK."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":196,"source_text":"But the other ones, they're very wise, and they have a lot of intelligence."},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":197,"source_text":"That dragon's been around a long time."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":198,"source_text":"Yes, he has."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"And there's a reason."},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"It's funny."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"I actually had-- and I was in an ayahuasca journey."},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"And this was right-- literally days after the election of Trump."},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"And I saw Trump as this wise dragon, flying around the room."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"And it was something-- because there's so much fear around that."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"And there was other people in the ceremony that thought we were all going to be put in concentration camps and taken away."},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"I saw the energy of what Trump is here."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"I'm not-- whoever's watching this, I'm not a big Trump supporter."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":199,"source_text":"I'm not saying that's--"},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":200,"source_text":"It was just maybe what you needed to see."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"It's just what I need to see to say, hey, let's not be afraid of this. Don't be afraid of the energy."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"Instead, maybe there is some wisdom behind it."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"Not saying that he's conscious of any kind of wisdom."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"But there should be-- whatever energy is coming through there for the planet and for the lessons that we need to learn at this time, it could be this ancient Reptilian wise energy to help move us through our evolution."},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"It's all here to serve."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":201,"source_text":"Otherwise it wouldn't be happening."},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":202,"source_text":"I like that."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"Well, actually, I wanted to ask you."},{"segment_id":545,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"So your process, I've noticed, online, from the videos I've seen."},{"segment_id":546,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"It's sort of a little bit different than your traditional channeler."},{"segment_id":547,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"It's almost like you're translating in real time."},{"segment_id":548,"speaker_group":203,"source_text":"And sometimes I've seen you go full talking as the being."},{"segment_id":549,"speaker_group":204,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":550,"speaker_group":205,"source_text":"I think most people who are familiar with this show are used to people sort of embracing the energy of that being."},{"segment_id":551,"speaker_group":205,"source_text":"And I'm sort of having a conversation with that being."},{"segment_id":552,"speaker_group":205,"source_text":"How does it work for you?"},{"segment_id":553,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"So initially I did let myself completely go into more of a deeper trance, and I took on the energy of the being."},{"segment_id":554,"speaker_group":206,"source_text":"I have trained myself to hold back a little bit to be a little bit more present and use my own personality in communicating."},{"segment_id":555,"speaker_group":207,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":556,"speaker_group":208,"source_text":"Just because I feel like there are some information in advance-- not advance, but there's a lot of information that people are just still trying to get a grip on that I feel like I need to explain it in my own terms, versus using the personality of the being."},{"segment_id":557,"speaker_group":208,"source_text":"But it just depends on what is needed."},{"segment_id":558,"speaker_group":208,"source_text":"And the deep trance-- I definitely initially got into a deeper trance."},{"segment_id":559,"speaker_group":209,"source_text":"So when you go into deeper trance, are you still able to hear the information?"},{"segment_id":560,"speaker_group":210,"source_text":"Yeah, I'm just not able to communicate with you as clearly."},{"segment_id":561,"speaker_group":210,"source_text":"I'm just totally replaced."},{"segment_id":562,"speaker_group":211,"source_text":"But the information that's coming through is clear information?"},{"segment_id":563,"speaker_group":212,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":564,"speaker_group":212,"source_text":"So that would be good for-- like right now, you and I-- or even maybe doing something over interview on YouTube."},{"segment_id":565,"speaker_group":212,"source_text":"But as far as personal channeling, it's easier for me to stay more present."},{"segment_id":566,"speaker_group":212,"source_text":"And that's why I've trained myself to kind of like...."},{"segment_id":567,"speaker_group":213,"source_text":"So you can be present to ask the questions."},{"segment_id":568,"speaker_group":214,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":569,"speaker_group":215,"source_text":"OK."},{"segment_id":570,"speaker_group":215,"source_text":"Otherwise you don't know what's coming through."},{"segment_id":571,"speaker_group":216,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":572,"speaker_group":217,"source_text":"So when you're by yourself, it's more of that-- I'm having a conversation with this being."},{"segment_id":573,"speaker_group":218,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":574,"speaker_group":219,"source_text":"But in this case, would you just go full trance then?"},{"segment_id":575,"speaker_group":220,"source_text":"I think full trance would probably-- maybe even a little bit more toward my personality."},{"segment_id":576,"speaker_group":220,"source_text":"But more into trance than a private channeling session."},{"segment_id":577,"speaker_group":221,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":578,"speaker_group":222,"source_text":"Because sometimes the client will stop you and ask questions."},{"segment_id":579,"speaker_group":222,"source_text":"And then you have to come back out of it, and then you have to go back in it."},{"segment_id":580,"speaker_group":222,"source_text":"So it's better just to keep a middle ground."},{"segment_id":581,"speaker_group":223,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":582,"speaker_group":223,"source_text":"Interesting."},{"segment_id":583,"speaker_group":223,"source_text":"I noticed one channeling where you were bringing in-- I think it was a Reptilian energy."},{"segment_id":584,"speaker_group":223,"source_text":"Or no, it was-- was it a Reptilian?"},{"segment_id":585,"speaker_group":223,"source_text":"One of these ancient bearded guys."},{"segment_id":586,"speaker_group":224,"source_text":"Ancient bearded guys?"},{"segment_id":587,"speaker_group":225,"source_text":"And he was one of these bigger tall beings that lived on Earth."},{"segment_id":588,"speaker_group":226,"source_text":"Oh, the red-haired giant."},{"segment_id":589,"speaker_group":227,"source_text":"The red-haired giants."},{"segment_id":590,"speaker_group":228,"source_text":"Yeah, that was a weird--"},{"segment_id":591,"speaker_group":229,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":592,"speaker_group":229,"source_text":"You were saying just physically how it felt. And you're like, this is just weird."},{"segment_id":593,"speaker_group":230,"source_text":"It was weird."},{"segment_id":594,"speaker_group":231,"source_text":"So was it just weird because it wasn't like anything else that you've against?"},{"segment_id":595,"speaker_group":232,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":596,"speaker_group":232,"source_text":"That's exactly-- it wasn't like anything I had felt."},{"segment_id":597,"speaker_group":232,"source_text":"It was like I was talking to somebody that looked like a human, but it felt like an animal."},{"segment_id":598,"speaker_group":233,"source_text":"Oh, OK."},{"segment_id":599,"speaker_group":233,"source_text":"Right, right."},{"segment_id":600,"speaker_group":234,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":601,"speaker_group":235,"source_text":"Animalistic energy."},{"segment_id":602,"speaker_group":236,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":603,"speaker_group":237,"source_text":"Yeah, and I remember watching that and sort of feeling that as well."},{"segment_id":604,"speaker_group":237,"source_text":"Any other strange, weird energies that you want to mention?"},{"segment_id":605,"speaker_group":238,"source_text":"I will mention channeling Brigham Young is quite interesting."},{"segment_id":606,"speaker_group":239,"source_text":"And he was the one who found the skeletons?"},{"segment_id":607,"speaker_group":239,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":608,"speaker_group":240,"source_text":"He was the one that took the Mormons--"},{"segment_id":609,"speaker_group":241,"source_text":"Oh."},{"segment_id":610,"speaker_group":242,"source_text":"--from the region in Illinois over to establish what the church is today."},{"segment_id":611,"speaker_group":242,"source_text":"So built up pretty much all of Salt Lake City."},{"segment_id":612,"speaker_group":243,"source_text":"Wow."},{"segment_id":613,"speaker_group":243,"source_text":"So you channeled that-- you channeled him?"},{"segment_id":614,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"He actually came to me."},{"segment_id":615,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"And it was very intense."},{"segment_id":616,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"And it's interesting because Utah is named after a raptor, which is a Reptilian."},{"segment_id":617,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"And he's got a lot of Reptilian-type energy."},{"segment_id":618,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"And he has just a lot-- I don't know."},{"segment_id":619,"speaker_group":244,"source_text":"It was just a very weird energy, I felt like, when he came to me."},{"segment_id":620,"speaker_group":245,"source_text":"In that interview?"},{"segment_id":621,"speaker_group":245,"source_text":"That energy on your website?"},{"segment_id":622,"speaker_group":246,"source_text":"So when I was like, all right, let's make a YouTube of the channeling, he actually switched and made it a little bit more light-hearted and loving."},{"segment_id":623,"speaker_group":246,"source_text":"Because I felt like-- maybe he did that because the collective wasn't ready to hear what he was actually telling me."},{"segment_id":624,"speaker_group":247,"source_text":"Oh, OK."},{"segment_id":625,"speaker_group":248,"source_text":"Because there is a lot of reasons why religion was brought here in the first place."},{"segment_id":626,"speaker_group":248,"source_text":"And some of them aren't so good, because it can capture our consciousness."},{"segment_id":627,"speaker_group":248,"source_text":"And he was part of that."},{"segment_id":628,"speaker_group":249,"source_text":"He was part of the-- bringing it here, right?"},{"segment_id":629,"speaker_group":250,"source_text":"He was part of making it into what it is today."},{"segment_id":630,"speaker_group":250,"source_text":"Sort of capturing that consciousness to keep it into a childlike state, versus expanding."},{"segment_id":631,"speaker_group":251,"source_text":"Can you go into depth a little about that?"},{"segment_id":632,"speaker_group":252,"source_text":"So basically, what I understand is Joseph Smith was here to bring in information from the past, and to help others understand where we were."},{"segment_id":633,"speaker_group":252,"source_text":"Then created a religion because of it."},{"segment_id":634,"speaker_group":252,"source_text":"Brigham Young actually, after Joseph had passed over, took all of the saints over to this region and established the church."},{"segment_id":635,"speaker_group":252,"source_text":"And I guess used that information against the people."},{"segment_id":636,"speaker_group":252,"source_text":"So it was good initially, but it was transformed--"},{"segment_id":637,"speaker_group":253,"source_text":"As all religions."},{"segment_id":638,"speaker_group":254,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":639,"speaker_group":254,"source_text":"And he really does-- Brigham Young really does have a very dark energy."},{"segment_id":640,"speaker_group":254,"source_text":"I feel like there was a lot going on at that time that really-- yeah."},{"segment_id":641,"speaker_group":255,"source_text":"Well, how long ago was this, when he came through?"},{"segment_id":642,"speaker_group":256,"source_text":"I don't know, maybe a year ago?"},{"segment_id":643,"speaker_group":256,"source_text":"Maybe?"},{"segment_id":644,"speaker_group":256,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":645,"speaker_group":257,"source_text":"Because I could see that definitely would be some blowback."},{"segment_id":646,"speaker_group":257,"source_text":"You could definitely get a blowback from the community."},{"segment_id":647,"speaker_group":258,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":648,"speaker_group":258,"source_text":"They were kind of like, that's not safe for you to do that right now."},{"segment_id":649,"speaker_group":259,"source_text":"To put that out."},{"segment_id":650,"speaker_group":260,"source_text":"But individually, if they come to you and ask questions in a private channel, we can do that."},{"segment_id":651,"speaker_group":261,"source_text":"Again-- collectively, though-- we all choose to have this experience."},{"segment_id":652,"speaker_group":261,"source_text":"So he's just a facilitator for that collective desire--"},{"segment_id":653,"speaker_group":262,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":654,"speaker_group":263,"source_text":"--to experience this religious constraints, or disempowerment, or whatever it is."},{"segment_id":655,"speaker_group":263,"source_text":"So again, another perspective."},{"segment_id":656,"speaker_group":263,"source_text":"Not to look at him as this bad guy, or--"},{"segment_id":657,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"That's really good."},{"segment_id":658,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"I love that."},{"segment_id":659,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"Especially because, at the time, Joseph channeled a lot of information that was beneficial."},{"segment_id":660,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"And then people-- he built this church, and people were coming to him."},{"segment_id":661,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"Oh, should I plant this type of seed in my yard?"},{"segment_id":662,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"Should I do this?"},{"segment_id":663,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"And then all of a sudden you're giving your power away to somebody else, when you're able to tap into that yourself."},{"segment_id":664,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"And obviously, like we said, you could use that for good or evil."},{"segment_id":665,"speaker_group":264,"source_text":"And the leadership was taken to use-- come to me for all of your problems, and I'll make it right."},{"segment_id":666,"speaker_group":265,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":667,"speaker_group":266,"source_text":"And they allowed it."},{"segment_id":668,"speaker_group":266,"source_text":"The people allowed it."},{"segment_id":669,"speaker_group":267,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":670,"speaker_group":267,"source_text":"So you get what you ask for."},{"segment_id":671,"speaker_group":268,"source_text":"[LAUGHS] Yeah."},{"segment_id":672,"speaker_group":269,"source_text":"Interesting."},{"segment_id":673,"speaker_group":269,"source_text":"Well, cool."},{"segment_id":674,"speaker_group":269,"source_text":"Well, I do look forward to seeing what other energies come through later today and the future of your work."},{"segment_id":675,"speaker_group":269,"source_text":"So, definitely."},{"segment_id":676,"speaker_group":270,"source_text":"Thanks."},{"segment_id":677,"speaker_group":270,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":678,"speaker_group":271,"source_text":"Thank you."}]
