## Speaker Group 203

544. Well, actually, I wanted to ask you.
→ {"text": "嗯，事實上我想問你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

545. So your process, I've noticed, online, from the videos I've seen.
→ {"text": "我注意到你的通靈方式，從我在網路上看到的影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. It's sort of a little bit different than your traditional channeler.
→ {"text": "跟傳統的通靈者有點不太一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. It's almost like you're translating in real time.
→ {"text": "幾乎就像你在即時翻譯一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "translating in real time 是 terminology 中的關鍵術語"}

548. And sometimes I've seen you go full talking as the being.
→ {"text": "有時候我看到你完全以那個存有的身份說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

549. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

550. I think most people who are familiar with this show are used to people sort of embracing the energy of that being.
→ {"text": "我想大多數熟悉這個節目的人，都習慣看到通靈者擁抱那個存有的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. And I'm sort of having a conversation with that being.
→ {"text": "然後我就像是在跟那個存有對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. How does it work for you?
→ {"text": "你是怎麼運作的呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 206

553. So initially I did let myself completely go into more of a deeper trance, and I took on the energy of the being.
→ {"text": "所以最初我確實讓自己完全進入更深的出神狀態，並接納那個存有的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "deeper trance 是關鍵術語"}

554. I have trained myself to hold back a little bit to be a little bit more present and use my own personality in communicating.
→ {"text": "我訓練自己稍微保留一點，讓自己更保持臨在，並用我自己的個性來溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 207

555. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 208

556. Just because I feel like there are some information in advance-- not advance, but there's a lot of information that people are just still trying to get a grip on that I feel like I need to explain it in my own terms, versus using the personality of the being.
→ {"text": "因為我覺得有些訊息比較——不是說先進，而是有很多訊息人們還在試著理解，所以我覺得需要用我自己的方式來解釋，而不是用那個存有的個性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

557. But it just depends on what is needed.
→ {"text": "但這要看當下需要什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. And the deep trance-- I definitely initially got into a deeper trance.
→ {"text": "至於深度出神——我最初確實會進入更深的出神狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 209

559. So when you go into deeper trance, are you still able to hear the information?
→ {"text": "所以當你進入更深的出神狀態時，你還能聽到訊息嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 210

560. Yeah, I'm just not able to communicate with you as clearly.
→ {"text": "可以，只是我沒辦法像現在這樣清楚地跟你溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. I'm just totally replaced.
→ {"text": "我就完全被取代了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 211

562. But the information that's coming through is clear information?
→ {"text": "但傳遞過來的訊息是清晰的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 212

563. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. So that would be good for-- like right now, you and I-- or even maybe doing something over interview on YouTube.
→ {"text": "所以那種方式適合——像現在我們這樣——或者可能是在 YouTube 上做訪談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. But as far as personal channeling, it's easier for me to stay more present.
→ {"text": "但對於私人通靈來說，保持更多臨在對我來說比較容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "personal channeling 呼應 terminology 中的 private channelings"}

566. And that's why I've trained myself to kind of like....
→ {"text": "所以這就是為什麼我訓練自己有點像是……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 213

567. So you can be present to ask the questions.
→ {"text": "這樣你就能保持臨在來提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 214

568. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 215

569. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. Otherwise you don't know what's coming through.
→ {"text": "不然你就不知道傳來什麼訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 216

571. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 217

572. So when you're by yourself, it's more of that-- I'm having a conversation with this being.
→ {"text": "所以當你自己一個人的時候，更像是——我在跟這個存有對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 218

573. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 219

574. But in this case, would you just go full trance then?
→ {"text": "但在這種情況下，你就會完全進入出神狀態嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 220

575. I think full trance would probably-- maybe even a little bit more toward my personality.
→ {"text": "我想完全出神可能——甚至可能更偏向我的個性一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. But more into trance than a private channeling session.
→ {"text": "但會比私人通靈時更進入出神狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 221

577. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 222

578. Because sometimes the client will stop you and ask questions.
→ {"text": "因為有時候客戶會打斷你問問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. And then you have to come back out of it, and then you have to go back in it.
→ {"text": "然後你就得從那個狀態出來，再重新進入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. So it's better just to keep a middle ground.
→ {"text": "所以保持在中間狀態比較好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 223

581. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. I noticed one channeling where you were bringing in-- I think it was a Reptilian energy.
→ {"text": "我注意到有一次通靈，你帶進來的——我覺得是爬蟲人能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. Or no, it was-- was it a Reptilian?
→ {"text": "還是不是——那是爬蟲人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. One of these ancient bearded guys.
→ {"text": "是那種古代留鬍子的傢伙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 224

586. Ancient bearded guys?
→ {"text": "古代留鬍子的傢伙？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 225

587. And he was one of these bigger tall beings that lived on Earth.
→ {"text": "而且他是那種曾經住在地球上、體型更大更高的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 226

588. Oh, the red-haired giant.
→ {"text": "噢，紅髮巨人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "red-haired giant 是 terminology 關鍵術語"}


## Speaker Group 227

589. The red-haired giants.
→ {"text": "紅髮巨人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 228

590. Yeah, that was a weird--
→ {"text": "對，那次很奇怪——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 229

591. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. You were saying just physically how it felt. And you're like, this is just weird.
→ {"text": "你說到身體上的感受。然後你就說，這真的很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 230

593. It was weird.
→ {"text": "真的很怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 231

594. So was it just weird because it wasn't like anything else that you've against?
→ {"text": "所以它之所以奇怪，是因為跟你之前遇過的任何東西都不一樣嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文 'you've against' 疑似為 'you've encountered' 的口誤"}


## Speaker Group 232

595. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. That's exactly-- it wasn't like anything I had felt.
→ {"text": "正是這樣——它跟我感受過的任何東西都不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. It was like I was talking to somebody that looked like a human, but it felt like an animal.
→ {"text": "就好像我在跟一個看起來像人類的存在說話，但感覺起來像動物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 233

598. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "噢，好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 234

600. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 235

601. Animalistic energy.
→ {"text": "動物性能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 236

602. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 237

603. Yeah, and I remember watching that and sort of feeling that as well.
→ {"text": "對，我記得看那段時，某種程度上也感覺到了那種能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. Any other strange, weird energies that you want to mention?
→ {"text": "還有什麼其他奇怪的能量想提一下嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 238

605. I will mention channeling Brigham Young is quite interesting.
→ {"text": "我想提一下通靈楊百翰是相當有意思的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Brigham Young 是 terminology 中的關鍵術語，摩門教歷史人物"}


## Speaker Group 239

606. And he was the one who found the skeletons?
→ {"text": "他是發現骨骸的那個人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 240

608. He was the one that took the Mormons--
→ {"text": "他是帶領摩門教徒——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 241

609. Oh.
→ {"text": "噢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 242

610. --from the region in Illinois over to establish what the church is today.
→ {"text": "——從伊利諾州地區遷移過來，建立了今天的教會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. So built up pretty much all of Salt Lake City.
→ {"text": "所以幾乎建立了整個鹽湖城。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 243

612. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

613. So you channeled that-- you channeled him?
→ {"text": "所以你通靈了那個——你通靈了他？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 244

614. He actually came to me.
→ {"text": "實際上是他主動來找我的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. And it was very intense.
→ {"text": "而且非常強烈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. And it's interesting because Utah is named after a raptor, which is a Reptilian.
→ {"text": "有趣的是，猶他州（Utah）的名字來自猛禽（raptor），而猛禽是爬蟲類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. And he's got a lot of Reptilian-type energy.
→ {"text": "而他有很多爬蟲人類型的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. And he has just a lot-- I don't know.
→ {"text": "而且他就是有很多——我也不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. It was just a very weird energy, I felt like, when he came to me.
→ {"text": "當他來找我時，我覺得那就是一種非常奇怪的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 245

620. In that interview?
→ {"text": "在那次訪談中？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. That energy on your website?
→ {"text": "你網站上的那個能量？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 246

622. So when I was like, all right, let's make a YouTube of the channeling, he actually switched and made it a little bit more light-hearted and loving.
→ {"text": "所以當我想說，好吧，我們來把這個通靈做成 YouTube 影片，他實際上轉換了，變得更輕鬆、更有愛一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. Because I felt like-- maybe he did that because the collective wasn't ready to hear what he was actually telling me.
→ {"text": "因為我覺得——也許他這麼做是因為集體意識還沒準備好聽他真正告訴我的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 247

624. Oh, OK.
→ {"text": "噢，好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 248

625. Because there is a lot of reasons why religion was brought here in the first place.
→ {"text": "因為宗教當初被帶到這裡有很多原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

626. And some of them aren't so good, because it can capture our consciousness.
→ {"text": "而有些原因並不那麼好，因為它可以捕獲我們的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "capture consciousness 是本段核心概念"}

627. And he was part of that.
→ {"text": "而他就是其中一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 249

628. He was part of the-- bringing it here, right?
→ {"text": "他是——把它帶到這裡的一部分，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 250

629. He was part of making it into what it is today.
→ {"text": "他參與了把它塑造成今天這個樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. Sort of capturing that consciousness to keep it into a childlike state, versus expanding.
→ {"text": "某種程度上捕獲那個意識，讓它保持在孩童狀態，而不是擴展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "childlike state 是 terminology 關鍵術語"}


## Speaker Group 251

631. Can you go into depth a little about that?
→ {"text": "你能再深入說明一下嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 252

632. So basically, what I understand is Joseph Smith was here to bring in information from the past, and to help others understand where we were.
→ {"text": "所以基本上，我理解的是約瑟·斯密來到這裡是為了帶來過去的訊息，並幫助其他人理解我們從何而來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Joseph Smith 是 terminology 關鍵術語"}

633. Then created a religion because of it.
→ {"text": "然後因此創立了一個宗教。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. Brigham Young actually, after Joseph had passed over, took all of the saints over to this region and established the church.
→ {"text": "楊百翰實際上在約瑟過世之後，帶領所有的聖徒來到這個地區，建立了教會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. And I guess used that information against the people.
→ {"text": "我猜他利用那些訊息來對付人民。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. So it was good initially, but it was transformed--
→ {"text": "所以最初是好的，但後來被轉變了——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 253

637. As all religions.
→ {"text": "就像所有宗教一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 254

638. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. And he really does-- Brigham Young really does have a very dark energy.
→ {"text": "而他確實有——楊百翰確實有非常黑暗的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "dark energy 是 terminology 中的關鍵術語"}

640. I feel like there was a lot going on at that time that really-- yeah.
→ {"text": "我覺得那個時期發生了很多事情，真的——對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 255

641. Well, how long ago was this, when he came through?
→ {"text": "嗯，這是多久以前的事，他來找你的時候？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 256

642. I don't know, maybe a year ago?
→ {"text": "我不知道，也許一年前？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

643. Maybe?
→ {"text": "也許吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 257

645. Because I could see that definitely would be some blowback.
→ {"text": "因為我可以想像那絕對會引起一些反彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. You could definitely get a blowback from the community.
→ {"text": "你絕對會受到社群的反彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 258

647. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. They were kind of like, that's not safe for you to do that right now.
→ {"text": "他們有點像是說，你現在這麼做不安全。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "They 可能指靈性存有或指導靈"}


## Speaker Group 259

649. To put that out.
→ {"text": "公開發布那個訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 260

650. But individually, if they come to you and ask questions in a private channel, we can do that.
→ {"text": "但私下的話，如果他們來找你並在私人通靈中提問，我們可以那麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "private channel 對應 terminology 中的 private channelings"}


## Speaker Group 261

651. Again-- collectively, though-- we all choose to have this experience.
→ {"text": "再說一次——從集體層面來說——我們都選擇了要有這個經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. So he's just a facilitator for that collective desire--
→ {"text": "所以他只是那個集體渴望的促進者——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 262

653. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 263

654. --to experience this religious constraints, or disempowerment, or whatever it is.
→ {"text": "——去經驗這些宗教限制，或失去力量，或不管那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. So again, another perspective.
→ {"text": "所以再次強調，另一個視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. Not to look at him as this bad guy, or--
→ {"text": "不要把他看成是壞人，或者——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 264

657. That's really good.
→ {"text": "這真的很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. I love that.
→ {"text": "我很喜歡這個觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. Especially because, at the time, Joseph channeled a lot of information that was beneficial.
→ {"text": "特別是因為，當時約瑟通靈了很多有益的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. And then people-- he built this church, and people were coming to him.
→ {"text": "然後人們——他建立了這個教會，人們來找他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. Oh, should I plant this type of seed in my yard?
→ {"text": "噢，我應該在院子裡種這種種子嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. Should I do this?
→ {"text": "我應該做這個嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. And then all of a sudden you're giving your power away to somebody else, when you're able to tap into that yourself.
→ {"text": "然後突然間你就把力量交給了別人，而你明明自己也能連結到那個力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. And obviously, like we said, you could use that for good or evil.
→ {"text": "而且顯然，就像我們說的，你可以把那個用於善或惡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. And the leadership was taken to use-- come to me for all of your problems, and I'll make it right.
→ {"text": "而領導權被拿來使用——來找我解決你所有的問題，我會讓一切好起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 265

666. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 266

667. And they allowed it.
→ {"text": "而他們允許了這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. The people allowed it.
→ {"text": "人們允許了這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 267

669. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. So you get what you ask for.
→ {"text": "所以你得到你所求的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 268

671. [LAUGHS] Yeah.
→ {"text": "【笑】對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 269

672. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. Well, cool.
→ {"text": "嗯，很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. Well, I do look forward to seeing what other energies come through later today and the future of your work.
→ {"text": "嗯，我很期待看到今天稍後還有什麼其他能量會出現，以及你未來的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. So, definitely.
→ {"text": "所以，絕對的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 270

676. Thanks.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

677. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 271

678. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
