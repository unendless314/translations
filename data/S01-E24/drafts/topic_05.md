## Speaker Group 119

333. So getting back to the ET stuff, you mentioned channeling a Zeta and-- was it channeling, or connecting with a Zeta and a Mantis?
→ {"text": "那麼回到外星話題，你提到通靈一位澤塔族——是通靈，還是與一位澤塔族和螳螂族連結？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

334. Well, I guess it would be more of like a contact experience.
→ {"text": "嗯，我想那更像是一種接觸經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. They came to me and just talked to me.
→ {"text": "他們來到我面前，直接跟我說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. And my vibration had to be raised so much that I didn't feel like I could even move.
→ {"text": "我的頻率必須被提升到如此高，以至於我感覺自己甚至無法移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. I was basically thrown down-- not thrown down by them.
→ {"text": "我基本上被摔倒了——不是被他們摔倒的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. But my energy felt so transitioned that I laid down on the couch.
→ {"text": "而是我的能量感覺經歷了如此劇烈的轉變，我只能躺到沙發上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. And then they came over me.
→ {"text": "然後他們來到我上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. And it just took a while for me to even gain my energy back.
→ {"text": "光是要恢復我的能量就花了好一陣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

341. Because I've been exploring my own personal connections with both Zeta and Mantis, could I ask what it felt like?
→ {"text": "因為我一直在探索自己與澤塔族和螳螂族的個人連結，我能問問那是什麼感覺嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. What did you--
→ {"text": "你感覺到了——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

343. I felt like I was in a dizzy tunnel.
→ {"text": "我感覺自己就像在一個令人暈眩的隧道裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

344. Were they coming at the same time?
→ {"text": "他們是同時來的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

345. They came at the same time, together.
→ {"text": "他們同時一起來的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. They came together, and kind of came toward me and spoke to me.
→ {"text": "他們一起來，靠近我，對我說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. I felt like the Mantis was doing something with my energy to raise it enough where I would understand, almost like they were speaking directly to me, like we are.
→ {"text": "我感覺螳螂族在對我的能量做些什麼，把它提升到足以讓我理解的程度，幾乎就像他們在直接對我說話，就像我們現在這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. But obviously there were no words.
→ {"text": "但顯然沒有語言文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

349. The Gray was?
→ {"text": "小灰人在說話？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

350. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. The Gray was speaking, and I could understand it, almost like you and I were talking.
→ {"text": "小灰人在說話，而我能理解，幾乎就像你和我在交談一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

352. So the Mantis was more of a facilitator.
→ {"text": "所以螳螂族更像是促進者的角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

353. Yeah, yeah.
→ {"text": "對，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 129

354. Just sort of being there.
→ {"text": "就是待在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

355. It felt like it was doing something with my energy to raise it to a certain degree where I could understand that.
→ {"text": "感覺它在對我的能量做些什麼，將它提升到某種程度，讓我能夠理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

356. And what did they say?
→ {"text": "那他們說了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

357. It was--
→ {"text": "是這樣——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

358. Or what did the Zeta say?
→ {"text": "或者說澤塔族說了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

359. OK, so it said, basically, you need to do your path.
→ {"text": "好，基本上它說，你必須走你的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. You've been chosen for this.
→ {"text": "你被選中來做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. And then they said all this stuff in, like, Egyptian that I-- I think they thought that maybe it would click or something.
→ {"text": "然後他們說了一大堆像是埃及語的東西，我——我想他們以為也許會觸發什麼，或是讓我想起什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. But I just didn't--
→ {"text": "但我就是沒有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

363. Well, what did it feel like?
→ {"text": "那感覺起來是什麼樣子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

364. It felt like ancient information that you need to reintroduce back into the human consciousness.
→ {"text": "感覺像是古老的資訊，你需要將它重新引入人類意識之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

365. Do you have an idea of what that is?
→ {"text": "你知道那是什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

366. Yeah.
→ {"text": "知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. So since then, I've done meditations and clarified it, and it always goes back to the Egyptian times.
→ {"text": "從那之後，我做了一些冥想來釐清，而它總是回溯到古埃及時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

368. Which is-- what are those messages, generally?
→ {"text": "那些訊息大致上是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

369. So there's a lot.
→ {"text": "有很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. [CHUCKLES]
→ {"text": "【笑聲】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

371. Just the short version.
→ {"text": "簡短版就好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

372. I think the biggest thing for that time period was there were beings on the planet.
→ {"text": "我認為那個時代最重要的是，當時地球上有各種存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

373. Already interacting with humanity.
→ {"text": "已經在與人類互動了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 144

374. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. And when I go back into my meditations, they show me that there are extraterrestrials all over the place that are in control of different paradigms of the social structures.
→ {"text": "當我在冥想中回溯時，他們讓我看到到處都有外星人，掌控著社會結構中不同層面的範式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. And somewhere along the lines, most particularly probably the Roman times when the Romans took over, they transitioned it to be more of a three-dimensional world.
→ {"text": "在某個時間點，最有可能是羅馬時代，當羅馬人接管時，他們將一切轉變為更偏向第三維度的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. And they sort of faded in the background-- with control still, but we are not able to see them.
→ {"text": "他們某種程度上退到幕後——仍然保持控制，但我們無法看見他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. And because of that, we have become unconscious.
→ {"text": "正因為如此，我們變得無意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. And so that's where all the transitions have happened.
→ {"text": "所以所有的轉變都發生在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. And so they just basically want to reintroduce the idea that they've always been here.
→ {"text": "所以他們基本上只是想重新引入這個概念：他們一直都在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. But the fact that-- they kind of say that the cycles of the planet have taken us into a lower dimension, and other beings took advantage of that.
→ {"text": "但事實上——他們說行星的週期將我們帶入了更低的維度，而其他存有利用了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. And so we stayed in three dimension for a while.
→ {"text": "所以我們在第三維度停留了一段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 145

383. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. Are you familiar with the density terms?
→ {"text": "你熟悉密度這個術語嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. Density levels correlating with chakras?
→ {"text": "密度層次與脈輪的對應關係？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 146

386. Yeah.
→ {"text": "知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. So isn't it the lower is your third, and then it goes up higher to the higher dimension?
→ {"text": "所以較低的是第三（密度），然後往上到更高的維度，是嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Deete此處似乎混淆了dimension與density的用法，但仍保留原意"}


## Speaker Group 147

388. Or density dimensions-- this is sort of creating a thesaurus of words to describe these experiences.
→ {"text": "或者說密度、維度——這有點像是在建立一套詞彙庫來描述這些體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. And I like to use the dimensional-- when I use the term "dimensions," I correlate it with actual scientific-- how the scientific community says we're actually in the fourth dimension with X,Y, Z, or up, down, left, right, and spacetime being the fourth dimension for measuring dimensional space and time.
→ {"text": "我喜歡使用維度這個詞——當我使用「維度」這個術語時，我將它與實際的科學概念連結——科學界說我們實際上處於第四維度，有 X、Y、Z，或者說上、下、左、右，而時空是用來測量維度空間與時間的第四維度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. And then fifth dimensional concepts and ideas would be getting out of the linear concept.
→ {"text": "然後第五維度的概念和想法就是跳出線性概念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. So from A to B, no longer going in that linear sense, but jumping around the spacetime.
→ {"text": "所以從 A 點到 B 點，不再是那種線性方式，而是在時空中跳躍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. And that gives a fifth-dimensional perspective on our reality.
→ {"text": "這就給了我們一種第五維度的實相觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. Where I've noticed with some of the other interviews, and Lyssa Royal and others used the term "densities" to describe the actual consciousness.
→ {"text": "而我注意到在其他一些訪談中，麗莎·羅耶爾等人使用「密度」這個術語來描述實際的意識層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. And we're sort of-- they say we're moving from third to fourth density.
→ {"text": "而我們某種程度上——他們說我們正在從第三密度移動到第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. And I notice these terms kind of get confusing sometimes, as people say 3D, 4D.
→ {"text": "我注意到這些術語有時會讓人困惑，因為人們會說 3D、4D。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. So would you say more of the third density, the heaviness of the energy?
→ {"text": "所以你會說更多是指第三密度，能量的沉重感？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 148

397. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

398. And then we're moving into fourth density?
→ {"text": "然後我們正在進入第四密度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 150

399. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. So what I understand with that is we were a fourth density or a fifth dimensional-type being before.
→ {"text": "所以我對此的理解是，我們之前曾是第四密度或第五維度類型的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. And then I guess it was the way that the cycles of the Earth rotated, or however it worked, beings knew this, and came down, and used these paradigms to take and control our fear and structure.
→ {"text": "然後我猜是因為地球循環運轉的方式，或不管它是如何運作的，有些存有知道這一點，就下來利用這些範式來掌控我們的恐懼和結構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. And we went down into density.
→ {"text": "於是我們墜入了密度之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. And some of us have stayed here for a while.
→ {"text": "我們有些人在這裡停留了一段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. And now that the earth has done its cycle rotation, we're able to come out of it.
→ {"text": "而現在地球已經完成了它的週期循環，我們能夠從中走出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

405. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 152

406. Does that seem like it--
→ {"text": "這聽起來像是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 153

407. Matches right with everything, yes.
→ {"text": "完全吻合，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Totally.
→ {"text": "完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. So the planet itself is it's own higher dimensional density being.
→ {"text": "所以行星本身就是一個更高維度密度的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. And we as densities-- beings-- on it have to evolve with her.
→ {"text": "而我們作為密度——存有——在她之上，必須與她一起進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 154

411. Yeah, yeah.
→ {"text": "對，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. That's the perfect way, because people get upset.
→ {"text": "這是完美的解釋方式，因為人們會感到不安。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. Like, how could the beings come and do that to our consciousness?
→ {"text": "像是，那些存有怎麼能來對我們的意識做那種事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. But it's like, we're all doing this together.
→ {"text": "但就像是，我們都在一起共同經歷這一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. And in a sense, in almost every single one of my channelings, it was basically humanity's choice.
→ {"text": "而在某種意義上，在我幾乎每一次通靈中，基本上都是人類的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. We let the fear overcome us.
→ {"text": "我們讓恐懼戰勝了我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. We let that maintain our consciousness.
→ {"text": "我們讓恐懼維持著我們的意識狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. And we just didn't break out of it in time, I guess, for everything to evolve.
→ {"text": "我猜我們只是沒有及時掙脫出來，以便讓一切進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. And we stayed with it for a while.
→ {"text": "所以我們和它待了一段時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 155

420. Yeah, I was hoping later today, in the channeling, we can get into some of the history a little bit more.
→ {"text": "對，我希望今天稍後在通靈時，我們可以更深入探討一些歷史。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. Fall of Atlantis, and these cycles, and stuff like that.
→ {"text": "亞特蘭提斯的隕落，還有這些週期，以及類似的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. And the human evolution.
→ {"text": "還有人類的進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 156

423. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 157

424. I think that was going to be the main focus.
→ {"text": "我想那會是主要焦點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 158

425. That's good.
→ {"text": "那很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 159

426. Sounds like you've gotten a lot of information on other beings.
→ {"text": "聽起來你獲得了很多關於其他存有的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 160

427. I think that's the biggest scope of my path as a channeler, because it can-- each channeler has their things that they focus on.
→ {"text": "我認為這是我作為通靈者的道路上最大的範疇，因為——每個通靈者都有他們專注的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. And I feel like right now that's what they want me to focus on, because this is what was needed, I guess, for this evolution process.
→ {"text": "而我感覺現在這就是他們想要我專注的方向，因為我猜這正是這個進化過程所需要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 161

429. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. And we can always learn from our past.
→ {"text": "而我們總是可以從過去學習。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. Even though we're recreating it in the moment now.
→ {"text": "即使我們現在正在當下重新創造它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 162

432. I know, I know.
→ {"text": "我知道，我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
