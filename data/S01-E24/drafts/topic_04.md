226. When did you go public with all of this?
→ {"text": "你是什麼時候決定公開這一切的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. When did you decide to share this gift?
→ {"text": "你什麼時候決定分享這個天賦？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 72

228. Share the gift!
→ {"text": "分享這個天賦！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. So I woke up one morning, and I had this burning sensation-- yearning or whatever-- to channel Princess Diana publicly and post it on YouTube.
→ {"text": "有一天早上醒來，我內心有股強烈的感覺——一種渴望——要公開通靈黛安娜王妃，並把影片放上 YouTube。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. And it was just something that I just knew I had to do.
→ {"text": "那就是一種我知道自己必須要做的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 73

231. Was she already coming through?
→ {"text": "她當時已經開始透過你傳訊了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 74

232. She had been coming through.
→ {"text": "她之前就一直在透過我傳訊了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Not quite like I did on the video.
→ {"text": "不過不像影片裡那次那麼深入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. That was pretty long and intense.
→ {"text": "那次時間很長，而且很強烈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. So.
→ {"text": "所以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 75

236. I don't think I saw that one.
→ {"text": "我好像沒看過那支影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Can you just give us a little sneak?
→ {"text": "可以稍微透露一點內容嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 76

238. It was very emotional.
→ {"text": "非常動人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. It was the first time I ever really did a long period of channeling.
→ {"text": "那是我第一次真正進行這麼長時間的通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. And she basically got into some deep issues.
→ {"text": "她基本上觸及了一些很深層的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. And yeah, that's basically how I started on the YouTube and decided whoever comes, I will channel you and make it public.
→ {"text": "是的，這基本上就是我在 YouTube 上開始的方式，而且我決定無論是誰來找我，我都會通靈並公開分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. And that's kind of how it went.
→ {"text": "事情就這樣發展起來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 77

243. And what was the reaction when you put that up?
→ {"text": "當你把影片放上去時，大家的反應是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. How did people respond?
→ {"text": "人們是怎麼回應的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 78

245. Actually, fairly well.
→ {"text": "事實上，反應相當好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. People really enjoyed it.
→ {"text": "大家真的很喜歡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 79

247. And then that propelled you to keep doing this?
→ {"text": "然後這就促使你繼續做下去？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 80

248. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. And then I started getting more and more people's deceased loved ones coming to me.
→ {"text": "然後我開始接收到越來越多人已故的親人來找我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. And that's when I decided to do private channelings on my own.
→ {"text": "就是那時候，我決定開始提供私人通靈服務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. And so it just kind of took off from there.
→ {"text": "就這樣，一切開始起飛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 81

252. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. Being in Salt Lake and in this energy, what's-- because you mentioned earlier people were OK with the grandmother stuff.
→ {"text": "身處鹽湖城，在這樣的能量環境下——因為你之前提到，大家對祖母的事還能接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. But beyond your personal grandmother, when you started going to other grandmothers or other spirits, have you gotten much of a blowback from the community?
→ {"text": "但除了你自己的祖母之外，當你開始與其他人的祖母或其他靈體溝通時，社群有沒有給你很多負面反彈？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 82

255. So I am not very verbal with all of that now.
→ {"text": "所以我現在不太會到處講這些事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. I just feel like if people are ready, Spirit will help them find me through the internet or whatever that way.
→ {"text": "我就覺得如果人們準備好了，靈界會幫助他們透過網路或其他方式找到我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. I've just had too many just put up walls, and they just don't know how to deal with it.
→ {"text": "我遇過太多人就是築起高牆，他們不知道該怎麼面對這些事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. I do find that women that have their children out of the house, and they're trying to rediscover themselves, they are starting to dabble with this, even if they are in the Mormon church.
→ {"text": "我確實發現，那些孩子已經離家、正在嘗試重新探索自我的女性，即使她們還在摩門教會裡，也開始涉足這些領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. So a lot of my clients that I have had from Salt Lake are older women.
→ {"text": "所以我在鹽湖城的很多客戶都是年紀較長的女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 83

260. When you say children out of the house, like, grown up and out?
→ {"text": "你說孩子離家，是指長大搬出去了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 84

261. Yeah. >> Is that what you mean?
→ {"text": "對。是這個意思嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 85

262. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. And they kind of are just like, I've gone to church for years.
→ {"text": "她們就會覺得，我去教會這麼多年了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. Had the same lessons over and over.
→ {"text": "一遍又一遍聽著相同的教導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. What else is there?
→ {"text": "還有什麼別的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. The kids are out of the house.
→ {"text": "孩子們都離家了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. So they'll start to explore these things, and they're more open to it.
→ {"text": "所以她們會開始探索這些事情，而且更能接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. And it's the ones that are having their little kids, their kids that they're trying to get into church zone.
→ {"text": "反而是那些還有小孩、正試著讓孩子進入教會體系的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. And there's still a little bit unsure what to bring into their family life, and even themselves.
→ {"text": "她們還有點不確定該把什麼帶入家庭生活，甚至是她們自己的生活中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 86

270. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. And probably being conditioned since birth, right?
→ {"text": "而且可能從出生就被制約了，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. So they're probably still a little scared to go outside of what they know.
→ {"text": "所以她們可能還是有點害怕跨出已知的範圍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 87

273. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 88

274. So, well, hopefully that'll be changing.
→ {"text": "所以，希望這會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. It seems like it is.
→ {"text": "看起來正在改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 89

276. Yes, I'm really hoping.
→ {"text": "是的，我真的很期待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 90

277. I've done a little research on the Mormon religion.
→ {"text": "我對摩門教做過一些研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. But for those who aren't too familiar, I'm guessing it's a pretty rigid set of rules in it's belief system?
→ {"text": "但對於不太了解的人，我猜它的信仰體系規則相當嚴格？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 91

279. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. I mean, it's not just a religion.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，它不只是一個宗教。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. It's like you change your whole life and culture, almost like Islamic.
→ {"text": "它會改變你整個生活和文化，有點像伊斯蘭教那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. You change everything about how you live, your interactions with people--
→ {"text": "你會改變生活的方方面面、與人的互動方式——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 92

283. In what ways could you go into?
→ {"text": "可以具體說說是哪些方面嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 93

284. Well, so you don't drink.
→ {"text": "嗯，比如說不能喝酒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. There are a lot of regulations with-- I guess just how you live your life.
→ {"text": "有很多規範——我想就是關於你如何過生活的各種規定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 94

286. Well, not drinking, that could be a positive thing.
→ {"text": "嗯，不喝酒可能是件好事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 95

287. It is a positive thing, yeah, because it can-- it's fun.
→ {"text": "確實是好事，是的，因為喝酒——它很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. It's really fun to drink every once in a while.
→ {"text": "偶爾喝一喝真的很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. But it can bring your vibration to a low state.
→ {"text": "但它會把你的頻率降到很低的狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. And you can't think very clearly.
→ {"text": "而且你無法清楚思考。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. So there's something to that.
→ {"text": "所以這還是有道理的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 96

292. I was recently in Kuwait, and it's illegal-- alcohol is illegal there.
→ {"text": "我最近去了科威特，那裡是禁酒的——酒精是違法的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 97

293. Oh, really?
→ {"text": "哦，真的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 98

294. Yeah, they don't have it at all.
→ {"text": "對，他們完全不能喝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. So I thought, oh, that's actually good to know.
→ {"text": "所以我想，哦，知道這點還挺不錯的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. There's nothing wrong with that.
→ {"text": "這沒什麼不對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 99

297. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. The thing is, though, I think with kids being told, like, we don't do that.
→ {"text": "不過問題是，我覺得當孩子被告知：我們不做那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. It's a rule.
→ {"text": "這是規矩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. Then they get more intrigued, and then they take it to a whole other level.
→ {"text": "他們反而會更好奇，然後就會走向另一個極端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 100

301. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. Overcompensation because of the--
→ {"text": "因為壓抑而過度補償——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 101

303. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 102

304. --suppression.
→ {"text": "壓抑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 103

305. I think sexual-- one thing when you said suppression, I think the sexual side of how we are in our culture is also another lifestyle that is unhealthy.
→ {"text": "我覺得性方面——你提到壓抑，我認為我們文化中對性的態度也是另一種不健康的生活方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. And just the way that we live.
→ {"text": "還有我們生活的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 104

307. And is that-- because I know the multiple wives thing, that's sort of-- how does that work?
→ {"text": "那是——因為我知道多妻制這件事，那種——是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 105

308. So that is a break-off from the Mormon church.
→ {"text": "那是從摩門教會分裂出去的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. So we were-- I say we because I've been a part of it for so long.
→ {"text": "所以我們曾經——我說我們是因為我參與了那麼久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. But I don't go to the church anymore.
→ {"text": "但我現在不再去教會了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. But the Mormon church was polygamist.
→ {"text": "但摩門教會過去是實行一夫多妻制的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. The government was getting at them.
→ {"text": "政府開始對他們施壓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. And so they said, OK, we're not.
→ {"text": "所以他們就說，好吧，我們不再實行了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. But another side said, well, we still want to be.
→ {"text": "但另一邊說，嗯，我們還是想繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. So they broke off, and they still do.
→ {"text": "所以他們就分裂出去了，而且至今仍在實行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. And they call the FLDS, or a fundamentalist.
→ {"text": "他們被稱為摩門教基本教義派，或基本教義派。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 106

317. OK, so there's different divisions within the Mormon--
→ {"text": "好，所以摩門教內部有不同的分支——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 107

318. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 108

319. See, I didn't even know that.
→ {"text": "你看，我根本不知道這點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 109

321. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 110

322. And so overall, basically, the polygamy is not so much?
→ {"text": "所以整體來說，基本上一夫多妻制不太普遍了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 111

323. No, not in the main Mormon church, no.
→ {"text": "不，在主流摩門教會裡沒有了，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 112

324. Because I've seen some TV shows of--
→ {"text": "因為我看過一些電視節目——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 113

325. Oh, like--
→ {"text": "哦，像是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 114

326. Where they go into the lives of--
→ {"text": "深入那些人的生活——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

327. "Sister Wives" and-- yeah.
→ {"text": "《姐妹妻子》之類的——對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

328. Yeah, and just glimpses.
→ {"text": "對，只是一些片段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And I'm like, oh, that's interesting.
→ {"text": "我就想，哦，這還挺有趣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

330. Well, they believe pretty much a lot of the same stuff.
→ {"text": "嗯，他們基本上相信很多相同的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. It's just the polygamy that's been altered that we have taken out because we were getting so much from the government.
→ {"text": "只是一夫多妻制被改變了，我們把它拿掉了，因為政府給了太多壓力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

332. I see.
→ {"text": "我懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
