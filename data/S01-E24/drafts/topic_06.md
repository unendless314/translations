## Speaker Group 163

433. Awesome.
→ {"text": "太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. So you've connected with all these different beings.
→ {"text": "所以妳連結過這麼多不同的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. Do you have one being that you normally connect with?
→ {"text": "妳有沒有通常會連結的某一個存有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. Or is it just always random?
→ {"text": "還是說總是隨機的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 164

437. A lot of times it is like the Council of Light, if it's to do with healing.
→ {"text": "很多時候是光之議會，如果是跟療癒有關的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. If there's something to do with healing.
→ {"text": "如果是跟療癒有關的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. It's just depending on the question and things like that.
→ {"text": "這取決於問題是什麼之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. If it's something with origins.
→ {"text": "如果是跟起源有關的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 165

441. And they call themselves-- is it a collective, the Council of Light?
→ {"text": "而且他們自稱——這是一個集體嗎，光之議會？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 166

442. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. But they'll visually show me who's stepping forward, usually.
→ {"text": "但他們通常會在視覺上讓我看到誰站出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 167

444. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. So within the council, one person of the council will step forward and say, OK, on behalf of the council?
→ {"text": "所以在議會內部，會有一位議會成員站出來說，好，代表議會？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 168

446. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 169

447. OK, cool.
→ {"text": "好的，酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 170

448. Especially if that individual, if they know that individual has a specific question about healing, with whatever reason, they know how to answer that question.
→ {"text": "特別是如果那個人，如果他們知道那個人對療癒有特定的問題，無論什麼原因，他們知道如何回答那個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. Maybe more than somebody else or whatever.
→ {"text": "可能比其他人更懂之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 171

450. Interesting.
→ {"text": "有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 172

451. But I do feel like, as far as the origins in humanity, it is more like ET and the Draconis that I connect with.
→ {"text": "但我確實感覺，就人類起源而言，我更常連結的是外星人和天龍座人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Reptilian type stuff.
→ {"text": "爬蟲人類型的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 173

453. OK.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. When you say the ET, so the Draconis part of the ET stuff?
→ {"text": "妳說的外星人，是指外星事物中天龍座人的部分？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 174

455. Yeah, but also just other ET beings that maybe are not fully part of the council with healing.
→ {"text": "對，但也有其他外星存有，他們可能不完全屬於療癒議會的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. They just know about humanity, and how things have fit in.
→ {"text": "他們只是了解人類，以及事情如何融合在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. Such as Lyran beings or things like that.
→ {"text": "比如天琴座人或類似的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. They have a lot of wisdom that came with this time period, and so they'll help with that kind of thing, if you're gaining knowledge.
→ {"text": "他們擁有許多與這個時期相關的智慧，所以如果你在獲取知識，他們會幫助這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

459. Very cool.
→ {"text": "非常酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. Do you have a favorite?
→ {"text": "妳有最喜歡的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

461. Well, I like doing the Reptilians and--
→ {"text": "嗯，我喜歡做爬蟲人的通靈，還有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 177

462. Yeah?
→ {"text": "是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

463. Yeah, their energy is just so direct.
→ {"text": "對，他們的能量就是那麼直接。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. And I like that.
→ {"text": "而我喜歡這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. I don't like the fluff of everything.
→ {"text": "我不喜歡那些囉嗦的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. Let's just get to the reason why we're here, and let's do it.
→ {"text": "讓我們直接進入我們來這裡的原因，然後去做吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. And that's how they are.
→ {"text": "而他們就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 179

468. Nice, nice.
→ {"text": "很好，很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. Very cool.
→ {"text": "非常酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. Do you think maybe later we can talk to some Reptilians?
→ {"text": "妳覺得待會我們可以跟一些爬蟲人對話嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. Let's see if they come through.
→ {"text": "看看他們會不會出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 180

472. Yeah.
→ {"text": "好啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 181

473. That'd be cool.
→ {"text": "那會很酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. Yeah, my process over this, doing this series, has been learning and categorizing, and learning about these different energies.
→ {"text": "對，我做這個系列的過程一直是在學習和分類，學習這些不同的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. And the Reptilians-- we had one super happy-go-lucky TReb come through Rob Gauthier, a Reptilian.
→ {"text": "而關於爬蟲人——我們有一次透過羅伯·高提耶來了一位超級樂天的爬蟲人 TReb。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. But other than that, I really haven't tapped into too many other-- personally, I've sort of seeked out and seen and connected with.
→ {"text": "但除此之外，我真的沒有接觸到太多其他的——就我個人而言，我尋找、看見並連結的。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文有些破碎，盡力保持原意"}

477. But I think that would be nice, to introduce--
→ {"text": "但我覺得那會很好，去介紹——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 182

478. So have you seen any?
→ {"text": "所以你有看過嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. Like, in your meditations?
→ {"text": "比如，在你的冥想中？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 183

480. Reptilians?
→ {"text": "爬蟲人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 184

481. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 185

482. No, actually.
→ {"text": "其實沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. Well, I-- kind of.
→ {"text": "嗯，我——算是有吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. But not in a communicative sense, where they're creating a rapport of question answers kind of thing.
→ {"text": "但不是在溝通的意義上，就是他們建立一種問答關係那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. Just images and feelings.
→ {"text": "只有影像和感受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 186

486. They just kind of flew by your line of vision.
→ {"text": "他們只是從你的視線中飛過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 187

487. Yeah, sort of Reptilians.
→ {"text": "對，某種程度上是爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. And I sort of got one one time during a meditation.
→ {"text": "然後有一次在冥想中我遇到一個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. I saw this really nasty, dark-- claws and teeth and snouts and all that stuff coming in.
→ {"text": "我看到這個真的很兇猛、黑暗的——爪子、牙齒、鼻口，還有所有那些東西進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "避免使用「恐怖的」等負面詞，用「兇猛」較中性"}

490. And then for a second, for a split second, I was really afraid.
→ {"text": "然後有那麼一秒鐘，一瞬間，我真的很害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. But then immediately I was like, well, no, that's super cool.
→ {"text": "但隨即我就想，不對，這超酷的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. Look at how cool that is, looking at it from the little boy's perspective.
→ {"text": "看這有多酷，從小男孩的角度來看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. Like a "Jurassic Park" or something like-- kids love dinosaurs, and playing with that stuff.
→ {"text": "就像《侏羅紀公園》之類的——小孩喜歡恐龍，喜歡玩那些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. It's a cool factor.
→ {"text": "這是酷的要素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. And as soon as I did that, it shifted, and it turned into a cartoon.
→ {"text": "而一旦我這麼做，它就轉變了，變成了一個卡通角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 188

496. Oh, really?
→ {"text": "哦，真的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 189

497. And it was kind of like Shrek.
→ {"text": "而且它有點像史瑞克。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 190

498. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

499. You know how he tries to be the mean giant in front of everybody, but he's just a cuddly Shrek guy.
→ {"text": "你知道他試圖在大家面前裝成兇惡的巨人，但他只是一個可愛的史瑞克。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 192

500. That's funny.
→ {"text": "這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 193

501. That was the analogy.
→ {"text": "那就是我的比喻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. I was like, it's just about your perspective and how you look at these things.
→ {"text": "我就想，這只是關於你的觀點以及你如何看待這些事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. Which creates them, right?
→ {"text": "而這創造了它們，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. So in reality, it was just a lovable cartoon puffy dragon thing.
→ {"text": "所以在實相中，它只是一個可愛的卡通蓬鬆龍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 194

505. That is what I've heard that you can transmute what you're seeing into something more lovable or in the light kind of thing.
→ {"text": "我聽說過這個，你可以把你看到的東西轉化成更可愛或更光明的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

506. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. So that was-- and I think that was the lesson, that it was coming through and saying, hey, we're not all scary, nasty-- we can be cool.
→ {"text": "所以那就是——我想那就是教訓，它傳達出來說，嘿，我們不都是可怕、兇惡的——我們也可以很酷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "保留原文的「可怕」但不額外強化負面暗示"}

508. It's just you guys are so used to perception.
→ {"text": "只是你們太習慣於感知了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. You're so trained, oh, this is bad, this is good.
→ {"text": "你們被訓練成，哦，這是壞的，這是好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. So if you let go of all that, there's actually something really cool to be seen.
→ {"text": "所以如果你放下所有這些，其實有些真的很酷的東西可以看見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. And even lovable and happy and good with the Reptilian stuff.
→ {"text": "甚至爬蟲人這方面也可以是可愛、快樂、美好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. But conditioning-- even in the New Age community, the conditioning of Reptilians has not been the greatest.
→ {"text": "但制約——即使在新時代社群中，對爬蟲人的制約也不是最好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. They've sort of had, you know, stay away from the Reptilians, or the evil Reptilian government, the Illuminati, and all that.
→ {"text": "他們有點像是，你知道，遠離爬蟲人，或者邪惡的爬蟲人政府、光明會，還有那些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "此處「邪惡」是陰謀論觀點的引述，非本集立場"}

514. Of course, that faction and those-- they do exist.
→ {"text": "當然，那個派系和那些——他們確實存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. But for us to-- I think it's time for us to embrace all of that side of us.
→ {"text": "但對我們來說——我認為是時候擁抱我們自己的所有那些面向了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. Because we all have Reptilian in us.
→ {"text": "因為我們所有人內在都有爬蟲人的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 196

517. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Well, as far as I know, there are the ancient Reptilians.
→ {"text": "嗯，據我所知，有古老的爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. And then, like I said, there's more the lower dimensional that just want to be in fourth density.
→ {"text": "然後，就像我說的，有更多低維度的，他們只想待在第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. And they don't want to evolve right now.
→ {"text": "而他們現在不想進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. And those are the ones that are kind of like, OK.
→ {"text": "而那些是有點像，好吧。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文有些模糊，保持中性描述"}

522. But the other ones, they're very wise, and they have a lot of intelligence.
→ {"text": "但另一些，他們非常有智慧，而且擁有很多智能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

523. That dragon's been around a long time.
→ {"text": "那條龍已經存在很久了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

524. Yes, he has.
→ {"text": "是的，他是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 199

525. And there's a reason.
→ {"text": "而這是有原因的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. It's funny.
→ {"text": "這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. I actually had-- and I was in an ayahuasca journey.
→ {"text": "我實際上有過——我在一次死藤水儀式中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. And this was right-- literally days after the election of Trump.
→ {"text": "而這正好是——就在川普當選後幾天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. And I saw Trump as this wise dragon, flying around the room.
→ {"text": "而我看到川普作為這條智慧龍，在房間裡飛來飛去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. And it was something-- because there's so much fear around that.
→ {"text": "而這是某種——因為圍繞那個有很多恐懼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. And there was other people in the ceremony that thought we were all going to be put in concentration camps and taken away.
→ {"text": "而儀式中有其他人認為我們所有人都會被關進集中營並被帶走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. I saw the energy of what Trump is here.
→ {"text": "我看到了川普在這裡所代表的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. I'm not-- whoever's watching this, I'm not a big Trump supporter.
→ {"text": "我不是——無論誰在看這個，我不是川普的大支持者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. I'm not saying that's--
→ {"text": "我不是說那是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

535. It was just maybe what you needed to see.
→ {"text": "那只是也許你需要看見的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

536. It's just what I need to see to say, hey, let's not be afraid of this. Don't be afraid of the energy.
→ {"text": "這只是我需要看到的，去說，嘿，讓我們不要害怕這個。不要害怕這個能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. Instead, maybe there is some wisdom behind it.
→ {"text": "相反，也許背後有一些智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

538. Not saying that he's conscious of any kind of wisdom.
→ {"text": "不是說他意識到任何智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. But there should be-- whatever energy is coming through there for the planet and for the lessons that we need to learn at this time, it could be this ancient Reptilian wise energy to help move us through our evolution.
→ {"text": "但應該有——無論什麼能量透過那裡來到地球，為了我們此時需要學習的課題，它可能是這個古老的爬蟲人智慧能量，幫助我們推動我們的進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. It's all here to serve.
→ {"text": "這一切都是來服務的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

541. Otherwise it wouldn't be happening.
→ {"text": "否則它不會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 202

542. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. I like that.
→ {"text": "我喜歡這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
