## Speaker Group 28

93. So you start channeling ETs, or thought communication, I guess.
→ {"text": "所以你開始通靈外星存有，或者說，我猜是思想溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. What was your first communication from the ET realm, or that?
→ {"text": "你第一次與外星領域的溝通是什麼樣的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

95. So I would set a daily practice of meditation aside.
→ {"text": "我會每天撥出時間進行冥想練習。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. And that's when I started channeling other beings and things like that.
→ {"text": "就是在那時候，我開始通靈其他存有之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. Or I guess spirit beings that I knew as people.
→ {"text": "或者我猜是我認識的人的靈體存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. And then that's when I started getting visuals of other beings.
→ {"text": "然後就是從那時候，我開始看見其他存有的影像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. I had a Reptilian that came that I didn't even know anything about Reptilians or anything at that point.
→ {"text": "有一個爬蟲人出現，而那時候我根本不知道什麼爬蟲人之類的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. And it kind of was like, that was weird.
→ {"text": "那感覺就像是，這太怪了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. Did my imagination create a giant lizard guy?
→ {"text": "是我的想像力創造出一個巨大的蜥蜴人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. I don't know, it was just a weird-- and then I just saw things that I didn't think that I could create in my mind.
→ {"text": "我不知道，那就是很怪——然後我看見一些我不認為自己能在腦海中創造出來的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. Like the Lyran beings-- cats and things.
→ {"text": "像是天琴座人——貓科生物之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. And I decided to look it up on the internet, and there were other people that had had similar experiences, or had visions of the same type of being.
→ {"text": "我決定上網查一下，發現有其他人也有類似的經驗，或者看過同樣類型的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. So I'm like, maybe this is a real contact.
→ {"text": "所以我想，也許這是真實的接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. And that's when I opened myself up more, and I got more of it.
→ {"text": "就是那時候我更加敞開自己，然後得到了更多這樣的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

107. So the first being was a Reptilian.
→ {"text": "所以第一個存有是爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. What did he say?
→ {"text": "他說了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

109. Well, he had-- it was interesting because he had this cape on.
→ {"text": "嗯，他有——很有趣的是，他穿著斗篷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. And it looked like he could have put a hood kind of thing.
→ {"text": "看起來他可以戴上兜帽之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. And so I was meditating, and he came through.
→ {"text": "所以我在冥想時，他就出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. And I was kind of like, whoa.
→ {"text": "我當時就像是，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. And then he faded away, and then a Gray came in.
→ {"text": "然後他消失了，接著一個小灰人出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. So I don't know if he shapeshifted to make it more something that I felt--
→ {"text": "所以我不知道他是不是變形了，讓我感覺更像是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

115. Like, "I'm an alien" kind of thing?
→ {"text": "像是「我是外星人」那種感覺？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

116. Yeah, I'm just an alien.
→ {"text": "是的，我就是個外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. But he's told me that he's my guide and protector.
→ {"text": "但他告訴我他是我的指導靈和保護者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. And so he's kind of always been there.
→ {"text": "所以他一直都在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. But initially it was a weird thing for me.
→ {"text": "但最初對我來說這是件怪事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. And then I got--
→ {"text": "然後我——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

122. Does he have a name?
→ {"text": "他有名字嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

123. Does have a name?
→ {"text": "有名字嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

124. Yeah.
→ {"text": "有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

125. As far as I can hear, he calls himself-- he says "Balthazar," is how he says it.
→ {"text": "據我所聽到的，他稱自己為——他說「巴爾薩澤」，就是這樣說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

126. Do you know what realm of Reptilians?
→ {"text": "你知道他是哪個領域的爬蟲人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. Because there's so many.
→ {"text": "因為有很多種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

128. Well, he says he's with the Alpha Draconis.
→ {"text": "嗯，他說他來自天龍座α星系。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. But he often works with the Council of Beings, which can be Pleiade or from all over, basically, to help humanity.
→ {"text": "但他經常與存有議會合作，成員可能來自昴宿星團或各個地方，基本上就是來幫助人類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

130. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. So for those who are watching, there are Alpha Draconians that are actually helping, as opposed to being all-- because a common misconception, I guess, would be that all the Reptilians are bad.
→ {"text": "所以對正在觀看的觀眾來說，確實有天龍座α星系的存有在幫助我們，而不是全都——因為我想一個常見的誤解就是，所有爬蟲人都是壞的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. A lot of people who subscribe to this information are like, oh, Reptilian, stay back.
→ {"text": "很多接觸這些資訊的人就會說，哦，爬蟲人，退後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

133. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. And with that, I'll Alpha Draconis is mainly just a star system.
→ {"text": "關於這點，我會說天龍座α主要就是一個星系。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. So it's like Pleiades star system.
→ {"text": "就像昴宿星團一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. And you're going to have benevolent beings, and you're going to have those that are in favor of humanity's evolution.
→ {"text": "你會遇到仁慈的存有，也會遇到那些支持人類進化的存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. And that's the same with the Draconis.
→ {"text": "天龍座人也是一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. They have a lot of evolved beings that are in service of humanity now, even though maybe at one point they hadn't been.
→ {"text": "他們有很多進化的存有現在正在服務人類，雖然也許在某個時期他們並非如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. And there are still those break-offs in that star system that are heavily domineering.
→ {"text": "在那個星系中仍然有一些分支是非常專橫的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. And then there's also the species that stay within Earth that are lower realms of Reptilian that I would say are more of the dangerous because they're not evolved.
→ {"text": "然後還有一些留在地球內部的物種，屬於較低領域的爬蟲人，我會說他們更危險，因為他們沒有進化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. And they wish to stay in Fourth Density.
→ {"text": "而且他們想要停留在第四密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

142. So all this information that you just described, this is all just coming through these different interactions with these different beings?
→ {"text": "所以你剛才描述的所有這些資訊，都是透過與這些不同存有的互動而來的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

143. Yeah, or just through channelings that I've done for individuals and, I guess, more public.
→ {"text": "是的，或者就是透過我為個人所做的通靈，還有，我想，更公開的通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

144. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. Well, when I first discovered your work, I was blown away on how correlating it was with all the other stuff I've been doing, interviewing others.
→ {"text": "嗯，當我第一次發現你的工作時，我非常震驚於它與我一直在做的所有其他事情、訪談其他人的內容是如此相關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. And you haven't been doing this that long, right?
→ {"text": "而且你做這個還沒多久，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. It's only been this past year or two?
→ {"text": "只是過去一兩年的事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

148. Maybe a year and a half.
→ {"text": "大概一年半。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

149. A year and a half. >> Maybe, yeah.
→ {"text": "一年半。也許吧，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

150. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. And I was blown away by the in-depthness of some of the channelings and the information coming through that, again, just correlates with everything I've been studying for the past 10 years.
→ {"text": "我被一些通靈的深度和傳遞出來的資訊震撼了，再一次，它們與我過去十年研究的一切都相符。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

152. Good, I'm glad I'm not way off.
→ {"text": "很好，我很高興我沒有偏離太遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

153. No, no.
→ {"text": "不，不會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. You're right on track, which is why I'm here, and we're doing this.
→ {"text": "你完全在正軌上，這就是為什麼我在這裡，我們在做這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. So after the Reptilian encounter, shapeshifting into a Gray, what other sort of beings came through?
→ {"text": "所以在爬蟲人遇到變形成小灰人之後，還有什麼其他類型的存有出現？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

156. There was a Gray and a Mantis that came through after I was resisting a while on my path and things.
→ {"text": "在我抗拒自己的道路一段時間之後，有一個小灰人和一個螳螂族出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. And I don't know if the Gray was the Reptilian in disguise.
→ {"text": "我不知道那個小灰人是不是偽裝的爬蟲人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. I don't know.
→ {"text": "我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. There was a lot of language that sounded like ancient Egyptian, and spoke of like choosing me to be the channeler for information, and things like that.
→ {"text": "有很多聽起來像古埃及語的語言，講到像是選擇我成為訊息的通靈管道之類的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. And so that's when I basically started taking things more seriously.
→ {"text": "所以就是從那時候開始，我基本上開始認真看待這些事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. And there was another very vivid contact where I was actually on the couch here.
→ {"text": "還有另一次非常生動的接觸，當時我就在這張沙發上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. I had fallen asleep one night.
→ {"text": "有一天晚上我睡著了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. And a Draconis being came.
→ {"text": "然後一個天龍座存有出現了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. And he looked like a giant bat.
→ {"text": "他看起來像一隻巨大的蝙蝠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. It was so intense.
→ {"text": "那太震撼了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. He had the wings.
→ {"text": "他有翅膀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. It was dark.
→ {"text": "很黑暗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. And I had-- it felt like a lower dimensional being standing to the side of me.
→ {"text": "而我感覺——像是有一個較低維度的存有站在我旁邊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. I couldn't get a glimpse of what it looked like.
→ {"text": "我無法看清它長什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. But it was cursing me out.
→ {"text": "但它在咒罵我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. And the Draconis was like, basically, surrender to your path.
→ {"text": "而那個天龍座存有基本上是在說，臣服於你的道路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. Let go of the old ideas, because at the time I was having a hard time transitioning.
→ {"text": "放下舊有的想法，因為那時候我很難轉變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. But he did it in such a-- I don't want to say dark way, because it benefited me to understand that I need to get serious.
→ {"text": "但他用了一種——我不想說是黑暗的方式，因為這讓我明白我需要認真起來，對我有益處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. But it was dark energy.
→ {"text": "但那確實是黑暗能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. It was just a very intense-- I mean, he was basically like-- the way he stood, his presence, everything was just very interesting.
→ {"text": "那只是非常強烈——我的意思是，他基本上就像是——他站立的方式、他的存在感，一切都非常有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

176. This was the bat being?
→ {"text": "這是那個蝙蝠存有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. The bat?
→ {"text": "蝙蝠？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

178. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

179. But you said there was another lower being at the same time that was yelling at you?
→ {"text": "但你說同時還有另一個較低層次的存有在對你咆哮？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

180. Mm-hmm.
→ {"text": "嗯哼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

181. And he was yelling at you as well?
→ {"text": "他也在對你咆哮嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 56

182. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. The bat being-- I actually woke up and was like, why is there a bat man in my room?
→ {"text": "那個蝙蝠存有——我實際上醒來時想著，為什麼我房間裡有個蝙蝠人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. Because it felt so-- or not in my room, but next to me, because it felt so much like a bat man.
→ {"text": "因為那感覺太——或者不是在我房間裡，而是在我旁邊，因為那感覺太像一個蝙蝠人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 57

185. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 58

186. But then the lower dimensional being was the one that's cursing me out.
→ {"text": "但那個較低維度的存有才是在咒罵我的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. The other one--
→ {"text": "另一個——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 59

188. So the other one was just there.
→ {"text": "所以另一個只是在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 60

189. He was there, and he basically communicated in a very dignified way.
→ {"text": "他在那裡，而且基本上以非常莊嚴的方式溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. But it was a very powerful way.
→ {"text": "但那是一種非常有力量的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. Like, to the point where you'd want to listen.
→ {"text": "強大到你會想要傾聽的程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. But everything just felt very intense.
→ {"text": "但一切都感覺非常強烈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 61

193. Have you made sense of that since?
→ {"text": "你後來理解那是怎麼回事了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. Why the two beings-- two different beings, and at the same time.
→ {"text": "為什麼是兩個存有——兩個不同的存有，同時出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. One is doing the-- you know.
→ {"text": "一個在做那個——你知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 62

196. Basically, from what I understand-- I don't know if this is 100%.
→ {"text": "基本上，據我理解——我不知道這是否百分之百正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. But because my vibration had to rise so much to communicate to this other Draconis being-- because I could almost see him.
→ {"text": "但因為我的頻率必須提升很多才能與這個天龍座存有溝通——因為我幾乎能看見他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. There was no third dimension, where I was at.
→ {"text": "我所在的地方沒有第三維度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. I had to slip through the fourth dimension.
→ {"text": "我必須穿過第四維度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. And so I was able to interact with fourth-dimensional beings that were trying to, I guess, take me down or communicate negative emotions to me, things like that.
→ {"text": "所以我能夠與第四維度的存有互動，他們試圖，我猜，拉低我或向我傳遞負面情緒之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 63

201. So when you open yourself up as a channel, then it can be negative, positive?
→ {"text": "所以當你敞開自己成為通靈管道時，可能會有負面的、正面的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. Everybody's trying to get to you in a way.
→ {"text": "某種程度上，每個人都想要接觸你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 64

203. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 65

204. To communicate through, or to-- what do you think the purposes are?
→ {"text": "透過你溝通，或者——你認為他們的目的是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 66

205. I don't think they like when there's light being brought into the soul.
→ {"text": "我認為他們不喜歡光被帶入靈魂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. I feel like there's a lot of emotions that they can gain when things stay in low dimensions.
→ {"text": "我覺得當事物停留在低維度時，他們可以獲得很多情緒能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. Low density.
→ {"text": "低密度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. And during the time when I was starting channeling, I didn't know how to block myself, or how to set the tone, I guess.
→ {"text": "在我剛開始通靈的時候，我不知道如何保護自己，或者如何設定基調，我猜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. My intention.
→ {"text": "我的心念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. And I got a lot of low dimensions coming in.
→ {"text": "結果有很多低維度的存有進來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. And I just don't think they like it.
→ {"text": "我只是覺得他們不喜歡這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. I don't think they like you shedding light and love to people and letting them know their power.
→ {"text": "我認為他們不喜歡你向人們散播光與愛，讓他們知道自己的力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 67

213. And I guess if you are going to, and they can see you as being a conduit, then, well, maybe they can use that energy.
→ {"text": "我猜如果你要這麼做，而他們能看到你是一個媒介，那麼，嗯，也許他們可以利用那個能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. Or use you as the conduit for their energy instead.
→ {"text": "或者反過來把你當作他們能量的媒介。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 68

215. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 69

216. So having both channelings of-- I try to guide more to the positive, and empowering messages.
→ {"text": "所以有兩種通靈——我試著更多地引導正面的、賦權的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. But I guess in the same sense you can have people channeling the bad stuff.
→ {"text": "但我猜同樣地，你也可能有人在通靈負面的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. Negative energy and disempowering information.
→ {"text": "負面能量和削弱力量的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 70

219. Well, and it's kind of like where our world is at today.
→ {"text": "嗯，這有點像我們今天的世界所處的狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. There's a lot of powerful people that know ancient knowledge.
→ {"text": "有很多掌握古老知識的有權勢的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. They know about those things.
→ {"text": "他們知道那些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. And instead of using it for good, they've used it for evil.
→ {"text": "但他們不是用於善，而是用於惡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. So it's like if I can tap into that, can they get me to use it for evil purposes or whatever the case is, like they've always been able to do?
→ {"text": "所以，如果我能接觸到那個，他們能不能讓我把它用於邪惡的目的，就像他們過去所做的那樣？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. Or can we transmute that and use it for collective of humanity's evolution?
→ {"text": "還是我們能夠轉化那個，用它來促進人類集體的進化？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 71

225. Right, right.
→ {"text": "對，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
