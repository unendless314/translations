27. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. Deete.
→ {"text": "迪蒂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. Thank you for having me here.
→ {"text": "謝謝你邀請我來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. I wanted to find out a little bit about yourself and your process, and your journey, and--
→ {"text": "我想多了解一下你的背景、你的過程、你的旅程，還有——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

31. All that jazz.
→ {"text": "還有那些種種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

32. --all that jazz.
→ {"text": "——還有那些種種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. Where do you want to start, or where would you like to start?
→ {"text": "你想從哪裡開始？或者說，你想從哪裡開始講？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

34. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. So I grew up Mormon since day one.
→ {"text": "我從一出生就是摩門教徒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. Born in Salt Lake City.
→ {"text": "出生在鹽湖城。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. We did move to Phoenix, so I didn't grow up in Salt Lake City.
→ {"text": "後來我們搬到了鳳凰城，所以我不是在鹽湖城長大的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. But growing up with that religious mindset, that was a big program that I had to break free from.
→ {"text": "但成長過程中被那種宗教思維模式束縛，那是我必須掙脫的巨大制約。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. And I think part of the reason that my journey started was two things that was the catalyst, which was my grandma passing away and, prior to that, I was sort of feeling like I had had enough of this life and was ready to kill myself.
→ {"text": "我覺得我的旅程之所以開啟，有兩個關鍵的催化因素，一個是我祖母過世，而在那之前，我感覺自己已經受夠了這一生，準備好要自殺了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

40. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

41. Yeah, I didn't know how to break out of the religion and the mindsets.
→ {"text": "是的，我不知道該如何掙脫那個宗教和那些思維模式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. And I felt like the only escape would have been to kill myself.
→ {"text": "我覺得唯一的逃脫方式就是結束自己的生命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. And then shortly after, my grandma passed.
→ {"text": "然後不久之後，我祖母過世了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. And I started getting like visitations from her.
→ {"text": "我開始感受到她的顯靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. And in the Mormon community, and I think as well as other religious communities, if you have a visitation from a grandma, it's not so weird.
→ {"text": "在摩門教社群裡，我想在其他宗教社群也一樣，如果你感受到祖母的顯靈，這並不算太奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. My grandma passed, and I felt like she was around me.
→ {"text": "我祖母過世了，我感覺她就在我身邊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. It wasn't like an odd thing.
→ {"text": "這不算什麼怪事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

48. OK.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

49. And so that really helped me learn to communicate with her.
→ {"text": "所以那真的幫助我學會了與她溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. And then I started having other beings come to me.
→ {"text": "然後我開始有其他存有來找我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. And then it was ET beings.
→ {"text": "接著出現的是外星存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. And that's when things, I think, got kind of weird for people.
→ {"text": "我想，就是從那時候開始，對其他人來說事情變得有點怪異了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Like, oh, we're having other-dimensional communication.
→ {"text": "像是，哦，我們在進行跨維度溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

54. So at the time were you still hardcore Mormon?
→ {"text": "所以那時候你還是虔誠的摩門教徒嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

55. I was transitioning out by that point, yeah.
→ {"text": "到那時候我已經在逐漸脫離了，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

56. And members of your community accepted the grandmother visitations?
→ {"text": "你的社群成員接受祖母顯靈這件事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

57. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

59. But then going beyond that, is that when things got weird?
→ {"text": "但超出那個範圍之後，就是事情開始變得怪異的時候了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

60. That's when I wasn't sure how much I should give out to people.
→ {"text": "就是那時候，我不確定該告訴別人多少。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. Like, when their passed grandmothers were coming to me, or even if their mother had passed and they were giving me messages, I felt like it was too much for me to say, hey, I can hear your grandma as well.
→ {"text": "比如說，當他們過世的祖母來找我，或者即使是他們的母親過世了並且傳遞訊息給我，我覺得如果我說：嘿，我也能聽見你祖母的聲音，這對他們來說可能太超過了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. This is what she's saying.
→ {"text": "她是這樣說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. But if I get the message from my own grandma, it wasn't so weird.
→ {"text": "但如果我接收到的是我自己祖母的訊息，那就不算太怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

64. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. So people-- because I guess some may feel a little intrusive then if they were given those messages?
→ {"text": "所以人們——我猜有些人如果收到那些訊息，可能會覺得有點被冒犯？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

66. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. And maybe they feel like, well that's my grandma.
→ {"text": "他們可能會覺得，那是我的祖母。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. She should be communicating with me only.
→ {"text": "她應該只跟我溝通才對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

69. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

70. And then that's the funny thing that I learned with being a channeler and a medium, is when you open yourself up to, any spirit can communicate with you and give messages of healing, if they feel like you're going to listen.
→ {"text": "這就是我身為通靈者和靈媒學到的有趣之處，當你敞開自己，任何靈體都可以與你溝通並傳遞療癒訊息，只要他們覺得你會傾聽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. And other people close themselves off to it sometimes.
→ {"text": "而其他人有時候會把自己封閉起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

72. Well, don't you have to get permission from-- or you get permission from their family members, from the other side?
→ {"text": "那你不需要得到許可嗎——或者說，你需要從彼岸的家人那裡獲得許可嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. How does that work?
→ {"text": "這是怎麼運作的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

74. The other side really doesn't care too much.
→ {"text": "彼岸其實不太在乎這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

75. They're just like, hey, someone here can understand me.
→ {"text": "他們就是這樣：嘿，這裡有人能理解我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. Let me communicate to you, for example, to convey that message.
→ {"text": "讓我和你溝通，比如說，來傳遞那個訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

77. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

78. And I guess when other people-- I was going to ask, is when some of the information coming through is spot on or accurate, does that sort of freak them out a little bit?
→ {"text": "我想當其他人——我本來要問，當一些傳遞過來的訊息非常準確或精準時，會不會讓他們有點嚇到？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

79. Yeah, that's when they're they come up with the logical excuses.
→ {"text": "是的，那時候他們就會找各種邏輯上的藉口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. Well, you probably know that because of this, or things like that.
→ {"text": "嗯，你可能因為這個才知道的，或者諸如此類的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. I think it does make them a little like, how would she know that?
→ {"text": "我想這確實會讓他們有點困惑，像是：她怎麼會知道那個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. That's nerve wracking.
→ {"text": "那很讓人不安。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. So my logical mind will step in and try to make sense of it.
→ {"text": "所以我的邏輯心智就會介入，試圖理解這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

84. Right, right.
→ {"text": "沒錯，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. Yeah, I've done that a long time ago.
→ {"text": "是的，我很久以前也做過同樣的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. That was-- part of the series was getting to see-- proving for myself whether all of this other side stuff is real or not, or if it's just, you know, are all these people just going on the internet and finding things out about me, and then conveying it?
→ {"text": "那是——這系列節目的一部分就是要去驗證——為我自己證明這些彼岸的東西到底是不是真的，還是說，你知道的，這些人只是上網查我的資料，然後再傳達給我？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. But then I'm like, no.
→ {"text": "但後來我想，不是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. That's not what's happening.
→ {"text": "事情不是那樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

89. You're like, I don't know.
→ {"text": "你就會想，我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. Yeah, I think that's why spirit just doesn't care, is because they connect to the heart.
→ {"text": "是的，我想這就是為什麼靈體不在乎這些，因為他們連結的是心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. And they know that even if the logical mind steps in, that heart space can eventually come through and be like, you know what?
→ {"text": "他們知道即使邏輯心智介入了，那個心的空間最終還是會浮現，然後說：你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. I feel like this is real.
→ {"text": "我感覺這是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
