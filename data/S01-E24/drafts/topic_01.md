## Speaker Group 1

1. What motivates relating? What motivates that ability to relate to another person? that is sort of this desire to 'see' and to be seen. open up and have a sense of that openness so that others can see you.
→ {"text": "是什麼驅使我們建立連結？是什麼促成與他人產生關係的能力？那是一種「看見」與被看見的渴望。敞開自己，擁有那種讓他人能看見你的開放感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. And you are open to seeing them. It's like this intimacy.
→ {"text": "同時你也願意看見對方。這就像是一種親密感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. I use the word 'see' because when we are seeking to relate we're really going back down to basics of our five senses.
→ {"text": "我用「看見」這個詞，是因為當我們尋求建立連結時，其實是在回歸五感的基本面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. What am I seeing?
→ {"text": "我看見了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. What am I perceiving with my eyes?
→ {"text": "我的眼睛感知到什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. Intuitively we might feel something.
→ {"text": "直覺上，我們可能會感受到某些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. We might feel something different than what our eyes are seeing.
→ {"text": "我們感受到的，可能和眼睛看見的不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. But because our intuitive body is picking up something.
→ {"text": "那是因為我們的直覺身體正在接收某些訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. That doesn't necessarily mean it's true for the other person.
→ {"text": "但這不一定代表對方也是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. In this relatability we're focussing on what we're physically observing.
→ {"text": "在這種人際連結中，我們專注於實際觀察到的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. So there is an inner knowing that needs to be paid attention to, an acknowledgment of what is in feeling, and our society often will talk about these boundaries and I think those are important, but I think those boundaries can also be readdressed with how we intuitively feel in the moment.
→ {"text": "所以有一種內在的知曉需要被關注，對感受的覺察，我們的社會常談論這些界線，我認為那些確實重要，但我也認為這些界線可以根據當下的直覺感受來重新調整。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. Sometimes intuitively you will be like this is a bad situation I'm outta here, I'm getting completely latched onto and drained, and I've had that before, it's definitely a different feeling to have to be emotionally in tune with yourself.
→ {"text": "有時候直覺會告訴你：這情況不對勁，我得離開了，我完全被纏上、被抽乾了。我經歷過那種感覺，要能與自己的情緒同頻共振，那絕對是一種不同的體驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. Ever wonder if there's intelligent life elsewhere in the universe?
→ {"text": "你是否曾經好奇，宇宙中其他地方是否存在智慧生命？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.
→ {"text": "我一直都在想這個問題……從小時候就開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. My name is Reuben Langdon.
→ {"text": "我是魯本·蘭登（Reuben Langdon）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day, I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.
→ {"text": "在 2007 年 3 月 29 日，就在大白天，我在天空中看見了許多奇怪的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. Coincidentally, I was working on the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.
→ {"text": "巧合的是，當時我正在拍攝電影《阿凡達》，飾演一個外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. And ever since then I've been on a quest...
→ {"text": "從那時起，我就踏上了一段探索之旅……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so... ...are they here with us?
→ {"text": "一段探尋外星人是否真的存在的旅程，如果存在的話……他們是否就在我們身邊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. If beings of higher intelligence are here... ...what is their purpose?
→ {"text": "如果更高智慧的存有確實在這裡……他們的目的是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Why don't they make themselves more known?
→ {"text": "為什麼他們不讓自己更廣為人知？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. Why the secrecy?
→ {"text": "為什麼要保持隱密？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. I've asked these questions to many experts, yet each seems to have a different theory.
→ {"text": "我向許多專家提出這些問題，但每個人似乎都有不同的理論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. So I thought to myself, why not ask the aliens directly?
→ {"text": "所以我想，何不直接去問外星人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. So that's what I set out to do!
→ {"text": "所以我就決定這麼做了！", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "嗯，算是吧……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
