## Speaker Group 327

1032. Now, it depends.
→ {"text": "這個嘛，要看情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1033. There are three types of channel states that I do.
→ {"text": "我做的通靈狀態有三種類型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1034. All of them are trance channeling.
→ {"text": "全部都是出神通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1035. The first and most common occurrence is just like when I visited TReb.
→ {"text": "第一種也是最常見的，就像我去拜訪崔博的時候一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1036. I'm going to visit him.
→ {"text": "我會去拜訪他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1037. I'm there with him astrally.
→ {"text": "我用星光體跟他在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1038. I perceive him in real-time, just as real as we are.
→ {"text": "我即時感知到他，就像我們現在一樣真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1039. And that happens the most.
→ {"text": "這種情況最常發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1040. And while I'm channeling down here, not conscious of anything that's being said, I'm hanging out with him.
→ {"text": "而當我在這裡通靈時，對正在說的任何話都沒有意識，我正在跟他一起玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1041. Going fishing with TReb.
→ {"text": "跟崔博一起釣魚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 328

1042. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1043. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 329

1044. And the second level is the same thing.
→ {"text": "第二種層次也是一樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1045. I'm out of my body.
→ {"text": "我離開我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1046. I'm experiencing something.
→ {"text": "我在經歷某些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1047. But usually, it's something that needs to be seen by me.
→ {"text": "但通常是需要我看到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1048. And this can be a lot of different things.
→ {"text": "這可能是很多不同的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1049. TReb showed me time periods.
→ {"text": "崔博展示給我看時間時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1050. He showed me different planets, different animals, different vegetation, just all sorts of stuff that at a later time comes in for referencing that I need.
→ {"text": "他展示給我看不同的行星、不同的動物、不同的植物，各式各樣的東西，在稍後時刻會成為我需要的參考資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1051. So that happens very seldomly.
→ {"text": "所以這種情況非常少見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 330

1052. When you say, come in for reference, in what sense?
→ {"text": "你說會成為參考資料，是什麼意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1053. Like the conversation we're having here, and you can reference that stuff?
→ {"text": "就像我們現在進行的這個對話，你可以參考那些東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 331

1054. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1055. Like sometimes, people are like, yeah, I met this reptilian being that was so and so.
→ {"text": "像是有時候，人們會說，對，我遇到了這個什麼什麼樣的爬蟲存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1056. And so I was like, oh, that's the same one that TReb showed me.
→ {"text": "然後我就會想，哦，那就是崔博展示給我看的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1057. Or I wonder what happened in this timeline.
→ {"text": "或者我想知道在這個時間線裡發生了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1058. It gives me a better understanding.
→ {"text": "這讓我有更好的理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1059. And I don't understand what it is in the moment, but in reflecting later, I always get what's going on.
→ {"text": "而且我在當下並不理解那是什麼，但在之後反思時，我總是能明白發生了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 332

1060. I see.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 333

1061. So that's the second most common occurrence.
→ {"text": "所以那是第二常見的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1062. And then the last one is where I'm like in a deep meditative state, where everything's just kind of blacked out, sometimes colors, sometimes things like that.
→ {"text": "然後最後一種是我處於深度冥想狀態，所有東西都有點變黑了，有時候會有顏色，有時候會有類似的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1063. And I'm able to hear what's going on in the session.
→ {"text": "而我能夠聽到會議中正在發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1064. Now, if I channel 100 times, probably 85 to 90 of them are me and TReb hanging out.
→ {"text": "現在，如果我通靈 100 次，大概有 85 到 90 次是我跟崔博一起玩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1065. All of them, but one of them would be the deep meditation where I'm hearing the session.
→ {"text": "全部裡面，只有一次會是深度冥想，我在那裡聽著會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1066. And this only occurs when there is something I really need to hear in that moment in the session.
→ {"text": "而這只會在會議中有些我在那個時刻真的需要聽到的東西時才發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1067. So it very rarely occurs.
→ {"text": "所以這種情況非常罕見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 334

1068. Do you ever go in and out, like you're hanging out with him, and all of a sudden you get sucked back into the room?
→ {"text": "你會進進出出嗎，就像你正在跟他一起玩，然後突然被吸回房間？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 335

1069. No, never.
→ {"text": "不，從來沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1070. It's always with TReb all the time, or he's showing me something, or then.
→ {"text": "永遠都是一直跟崔博在一起，或者他在展示某些東西給我看，或者就是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1071. And the second most common one where he's showing me something, it's not with him.
→ {"text": "而第二常見的那種，他展示某些東西給我看，不是跟他在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1072. It's me separately by myself seeing these things.
→ {"text": "是我自己單獨在看這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1073. So that rarely ever occurs.
→ {"text": "所以那種情況很少發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1074. Out of 100 times, maybe 14 times I'll be doing that.
→ {"text": "100 次裡面，可能有 14 次我會那樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1075. So it's not very-- and it's probably less than that, but I'm trying to give a scale for people to understand that.
→ {"text": "所以這並不是很——而且可能比那還少，但我試圖給人們一個比例好理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 336

1076. Now, do you-- since starting the channeling, since having these conversations with TReb, the meditations, have you become more-- instead of just applying these things to your life, have you noticed your own intuitiveness or psychic abilities, or anything else happening in these past few years?
→ {"text": "那麼，你——自從開始通靈以來，自從與崔博進行這些對話、進行冥想以來，你變得更——與其說只是把這些東西應用到你的生活中，不如說你有沒有注意到你自己的直覺或通靈能力，或者過去幾年裡發生的任何其他事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 337

1077. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "絕對有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1078. The integration process.
→ {"text": "整合過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1079. And this is something that's fairly new to me.
→ {"text": "這對我來說是相當新的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1080. I've been doing channeling in the sense of public channeling since about 2010, late 2010.
→ {"text": "我從大約 2010 年、2010 年底開始做公開通靈意義上的通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1081. And in that time, I was always aware that TReb's energy was around me, but it never went past that.
→ {"text": "在那段時間裡，我一直意識到崔博的能量在我周圍，但從來沒有超越那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1082. My life, my intuition was good, but it was no better than where I was when I first started meditating and learning to receive.
→ {"text": "我的生活、我的直覺都很好，但並沒有比我剛開始冥想和學習接收時更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1083. In the last year, year and a half-- well, it's probably closer to two years now-- I've actually been more conscious of TReb and Aridif as they come through.
→ {"text": "在過去一年、一年半裡——嗯，現在可能接近兩年了——我實際上對崔博和阿里迪夫現身時更有意識了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1084. I can hear TReb give me messages while I'm in the wakened state.
→ {"text": "我可以在清醒狀態下聽到崔博給我訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1085. I feel more of his consciousness.
→ {"text": "我更能感受到他的意識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1086. My personality even is more the style of TReb, where-- like TReb, he loves everything.
→ {"text": "我的人格甚至更接近崔博的風格，就像——就像崔博，他熱愛一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1087. He wants to experience everything.
→ {"text": "他想要體驗一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1088. And I find more of that energy in me.
→ {"text": "而我在自己身上找到更多那種能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1089. And there's always been a part of that for me.
→ {"text": "我身上一直有一部分是那樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1090. I've always enjoyed enjoying things, but to a different extent.
→ {"text": "我一直很享受享受事物，但程度不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1091. I could feel that combining with TReb's energy.
→ {"text": "我能感覺到那與崔博的能量結合在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1092. So it's like an amalgamation.
→ {"text": "所以這就像是融合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1093. And this goes with psychic ability.
→ {"text": "這適用於通靈能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1094. It goes with everything.
→ {"text": "適用於一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1095. There's times where I grab something and walk it over to Kalina.
→ {"text": "有時候我會拿起某樣東西走過去給卡莉娜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1096. And she's like, I was just going to ask you for that.
→ {"text": "然後她會說，我剛好要跟你要那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1097. Or things simple like that, like picking a movie that she had wanted to watch, or a song that she was dying to hear.
→ {"text": "或者像那樣簡單的事情，比如挑選一部她想看的電影，或一首她非常想聽的歌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1098. So those things.
→ {"text": "就是這些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1099. And that shows a great deal about both of our connection too as well.
→ {"text": "這也顯示了我們兩人的連結有多深。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1100. But meeting Kalina was probably one of the energetic shifting points on a lot of things.
→ {"text": "但遇見卡莉娜可能是很多事情的能量轉變點之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1101. When I met Kalina, it's just the energy shifted so much.
→ {"text": "當我遇見卡莉娜時，能量就轉變了這麼多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1102. I finally found a partner who was on the same journey that I was.
→ {"text": "我終於找到了一個與我在同一旅程上的伴侶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1103. The same excitements.
→ {"text": "同樣的興奮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1104. She met me through the work I was doing.
→ {"text": "她是透過我正在做的工作認識我的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1105. She was helping me edit videos and stuff as we developed a friendship for a couple of years.
→ {"text": "她在幫我編輯影片之類的，在我們建立友誼的這幾年裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1106. And then as my divorce happened with my ex-wife, then me and her got together.
→ {"text": "然後當我與前妻離婚後，我和她就在一起了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1107. And we started a relationship.
→ {"text": "我們開始了一段關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1108. And her excitements and my excitements, because they're on the same level, we reflect that.
→ {"text": "而她的興奮和我的興奮，因為它們在同一個層次上，我們反映出那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1109. So our psychic ability helps.
→ {"text": "所以我們的通靈能力有所幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1110. The efforts of the work has helped.
→ {"text": "工作的努力也有所幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1111. I was just-- when I first started channeling, I was doing it for fun.
→ {"text": "我只是——當我剛開始通靈時，我是為了好玩而做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1112. I was doing it for the benefit of other people, which I still am.
→ {"text": "我是為了其他人的利益而做的，我現在仍然是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1113. But I had a daytime job.
→ {"text": "但我有一份日間工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1114. I worked that job 10 hours a day.
→ {"text": "我每天工作 10 個小時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 338

1115. I was going to say, how in the world could you meditate for as long as you did for the first two years, and still maintain a job, and have a son?
→ {"text": "我正想說，你到底是怎麼在頭兩年冥想那麼長時間，還能保住工作，還有兒子要照顧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1116. And that's crazy.
→ {"text": "那太瘋狂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1117. Did you sleep?
→ {"text": "你有睡覺嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 339

1118. Well, the first hour and 25 minutes, that was pretty easy.
→ {"text": "嗯，第一個小時又 25 分鐘，那挺容易的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1119. The first one in the morning before all the kids.
→ {"text": "早上第一次，在所有孩子到來之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1120. Because I used to babysit, so I was at home.
→ {"text": "因為我以前做保母，所以我在家裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 340

1121. Oh, wow.
→ {"text": "哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 341

1122. I could work from home.
→ {"text": "我可以在家工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1123. And when these four to six kids would come over, I would be able to meditate before they got there, and then once at lunch time when I put them all for a nap, and once after Jeremy.
→ {"text": "而當這四到六個孩子過來時，我能夠在他們到達之前冥想，然後在午餐時間我讓他們全部午睡時冥想一次，還有在 Jeremy 之後再冥想一次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1124. He would get home from school after the kids would leave.
→ {"text": "他會在孩子們離開後從學校回家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1125. And then I would be able to put him to bed, and then do it.
→ {"text": "然後我就能讓他上床睡覺，然後再做一次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 342

1126. So you figured it out somehow.
→ {"text": "所以你想辦法搞定了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 343

1127. I did.
→ {"text": "我做到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 344

1128. You managed to get those several-- two to four hours a day?
→ {"text": "你設法獲得了那幾個——每天兩到四個小時？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 345

1129. Well, three of the meditations were an hour to an hour and 25.
→ {"text": "嗯，三次冥想都是一小時到一小時又 25 分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1130. My closed-eye technique didn't require me to be anywhere.
→ {"text": "我的閉眼技法不需要我在任何特定地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1131. I could still be present with you.
→ {"text": "我仍然可以與你同在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1132. Like right now, I'm closing my eyes.
→ {"text": "就像現在，我正在閉上眼睛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1133. I can hear you.
→ {"text": "我可以聽到你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1134. I can hear Kalina, so I'm OK.
→ {"text": "我可以聽到卡莉娜，所以我沒問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1135. And if I didn't need my eyes, I could literally up to six to eight hours a day do the closed-eye technique.
→ {"text": "而如果我不需要用眼睛，我實際上每天可以做六到八小時的閉眼技法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1136. Whenever I didn't need my eyes, they were shut all the time.
→ {"text": "每當我不需要用眼睛時，它們就一直閉著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1137. I was dedicated.
→ {"text": "我很專注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1138. I was like--
→ {"text": "我就像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 346

1139. Wow.
→ {"text": "哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1140. That's awesome.
→ {"text": "太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 347

1141. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1142. I was like--
→ {"text": "我就像——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 348

1143. I'm taking notes.
→ {"text": "我在做筆記。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 349

1144. An addict for meditation.
→ {"text": "冥想成癮者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 350

1145. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 351

1146. It was.
→ {"text": "確實是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1147. I was addicted to it.
→ {"text": "我對它上癮了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 352

1148. Do you still meditate then?
→ {"text": "那你現在還冥想嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 353

1149. The only meditation I need now is when I connect to TReb.
→ {"text": "我現在唯一需要的冥想就是當我連結到崔博的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1150. I do it so frequently, that that is my meditation now.
→ {"text": "我做得如此頻繁，以至於那現在就是我的冥想了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 354

1151. I was going to say-- because it sounds like a meditation.
→ {"text": "我正想說——因為這聽起來就像冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1152. You're going to this deep-- you're going to another planet.
→ {"text": "你去到這個深處——你去到另一個星球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1153. Jeez.
→ {"text": "天哪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1154. That's awesome.
→ {"text": "太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 355

1155. Well, in all honesty, though, it's something that I found about people in their spiritual journey.
→ {"text": "嗯，老實說，這是我發現的關於人們在靈性旅程中的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1156. And something that just recently was brought up in a conversation.
→ {"text": "而且這是最近在一次對話中提出的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1157. When you reach a certain point of integrating with these beings or integrating with your higher self, whatever it is, when you feel good about your life when you're living that vibration, there's not always as much need for meditation.
→ {"text": "當你達到與這些存有整合或與你的高我整合的某個點時，無論是什麼，當你對生活感覺良好、當你活在那個頻率中時，就不再總是那麼需要冥想了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1158. So when I meditate and connect my TReb, I'm integrating.
→ {"text": "所以當我冥想並連結到崔博時，我在整合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1159. But during the day now, I'm integrating, too, because I used that meditation to pull myself out of suffering and pain to start with.
→ {"text": "但現在白天時，我也在整合，因為我一開始使用那個冥想將自己從痛苦和疼痛中拉出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1160. And then I used it to hone my skills.
→ {"text": "然後我用它來磨練我的技能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1161. My skills are here.
→ {"text": "我的技能已經在這裡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1162. They're strong.
→ {"text": "它們很強大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1163. I don't have very much suffering anymore.
→ {"text": "我不再有太多痛苦了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1164. I'm still human, so a little bit here and there.
→ {"text": "我還是人類，所以這裡那裡還是會有一點點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1165. So now there's not as much a need.
→ {"text": "所以現在沒有那麼大的需求了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1166. And the time I spend with TReb, I'm doing this now as a living.
→ {"text": "而我與崔博相處的時間，我現在以此為生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1167. So when I'm doing it once, twice, three times a day, that's my meditation.
→ {"text": "所以當我一天做一次、兩次、三次時，那就是我的冥想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

1168. It works.
→ {"text": "這很有效。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 356

1169. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
→ {"text": "太棒了，太棒了，太棒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
