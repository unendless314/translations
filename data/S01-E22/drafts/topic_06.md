419. And that was the whole journey, I think, for me to collect the guts, I would say, to be faithful to what I feel resonates most with me.

## Speaker Group 145

421. You've sort of awoken to the Yahyel channeling by going to another channeler?
→ {"text": "所以你是透過去找另一位通靈者，才覺醒到亞耶爾通靈的能力？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人提問，引出關鍵轉折故事"}


## Speaker Group 146

422. Yeah, in a sense.
→ {"text": "對，某種程度上是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. So I've been receiving all these downloads, mainly in night times, or just before waking, astral travel experiences. and divine synchronicity helped me to actually attend to one of his group sessions-- And while I was in the audience, I didn't have any questions.
→ {"text": "我一直在接收這些下載訊息，主要是在夜間，或者剛要醒來的時候，還有星光旅行的體驗。後來神聖同步性幫助我，讓我真的參加了他的一場團體活動——當我坐在觀眾席時，我沒有任何問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：星光旅行、神聖同步性。開始描述第一個事件"}

424. I was just feeling at home and being in a bliss state being with these energies, because it felt so much at home, but not really questions.
→ {"text": "我只是感到很自在，處在一種極樂狀態中，和這些能量在一起讓我感覺如此像回家，但沒有什麼問題想問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：極樂狀態"}

425. And I was sitting there, and at some point, the sounds kind of went down, the lights dimmed, in my experience, even though I was sitting between other people.
→ {"text": "我就坐在那裡，在某個時刻，聲音好像降低了，燈光也變暗了，這是我的體驗，儘管我當時坐在其他人中間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "意識狀態改變的描述"}

426. And I felt super drawn inwards, so I had to close my eyes.
→ {"text": "我感到強烈地被往內拉，所以不得不閉上眼睛。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. And I felt other beings around me.
→ {"text": "我感覺到有其他存有在我身邊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：存有"}

428. And to have this experience in a waking state, that was new to me.
→ {"text": "在清醒狀態下有這樣的體驗，對我來說是全新的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "強調這次體驗的特殊性"}

429. So I felt very clearly that there was work being done on me.

430. And I could fully relax in it.
→ {"text": "我可以完全放鬆地沉浸其中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. It felt super loving.

432. I felt like, oh, I'm in good hands, this is beautiful.
→ {"text": "我感覺，哦，我在安全的手中，這太美好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. And then a picture was given to me of, basically, a cat sitting on my head.
→ {"text": "然後我收到一個影像，基本上就是一隻貓坐在我頭上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵情節：貓的影像首次出現"}

434. And the energy that surrounded that was very giggly-like, joyful, "this is funny."
→ {"text": "圍繞著這個影像的能量非常像咯咯笑的感覺，喜悅的，「這很好玩」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：能量。描述貓影像伴隨的玩耍能量"}

→ {"text": "我想，好吧——就像是，這是你，貓在你頭上，很好玩，我就想，好吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. And that whole thing lasted maybe 10 minutes.
→ {"text": "整個經歷大概持續了 10 分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. It was a little bit out-of-time-ish for me.
→ {"text": "對我來說有點超越時間的感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. And then that first half of the channeling also ended.
→ {"text": "然後通靈的前半段也結束了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. And the sounds came back into the room for me, the lights went on again, you could say.
→ {"text": "對我來說，聲音回到了房間裡，燈光又亮了起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. And I was left with that feeling that a cat was sitting on my head.
→ {"text": "我還留著那種貓坐在我頭上的感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "強調視覺影像轉為真實觸感"}

441. Like an actual pressure, I could really feel it.
→ {"text": "就像真實的壓力，我真的能感覺到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. And I was hesitant to move because I thought it might fall off, even though I knew it wasn't really there.
→ {"text": "我不太敢移動，因為我覺得它可能會掉下來，儘管我知道它並不是真的在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "幽默地描述幻象與真實感的交織"}

443. And a year later, in the Netherlands, I went to see an ET channeler woman.
→ {"text": "一年後，在荷蘭，我去找了一位外星通靈者，一位女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：外星通靈者。時間跳躍，進入第二個事件"}

444. And she lives in the Netherlands as well.
→ {"text": "她也住在荷蘭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. And I actually went to have my back straightened out.
→ {"text": "我其實是去讓她幫我調整背部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. I had some issues there between my shoulders.
→ {"text": "我肩膀之間有些問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. She said she did channeling and worked with a team that does also physical healings or, like we understand, a realignment of your own self-healing abilities.
→ {"text": "她說她做通靈工作，並與一個團隊合作，他們也做物質的療癒，或者像我們理解的，重新校準你自己的自我療癒能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：通靈、物質的、重新校準、自我療癒能力"}

448. And I was curious about that, so I went there.
→ {"text": "我對此很好奇，所以就去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. And a month before I went to see her, Arjun actually started speaking out loud to me, which was quite a surprise for me because he was coming closer and closer.
→ {"text": "在我去找她的一個月前，阿瓊實際上開始大聲對我說話，這對我來說是相當大的驚喜，因為他越來越靠近了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：阿瓊。時間線倒敘：去找通靈者前一個月"}

450. I'd seen his face.
→ {"text": "我看過他的臉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. I knew he was with me during meditations.
→ {"text": "我知道他在冥想時和我在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：冥想"}

452. And then at some point, I asked in my mind, I just opened conversation-- and he had been waiting for that, I understand that now-- asking, who are you?
→ {"text": "然後在某個時刻，我在心中問，我就打開對話——我現在明白，他一直在等待這個——問，你是誰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：心智"}

453. And I got this huge spelling out, Yah-Yel.
→ {"text": "我收到一個巨大的拼寫，Yah-Yel。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：亞耶爾（首次收到族群名稱）"}

454. Like for him, it was more logical to first pinpoint-- this is who we are as a race more where I am from then to use a name, because they don't use names.
→ {"text": "對他來說，更符合邏輯的是先指出——這是我們作為一個族群的身份，我來自哪裡，而不是使用名字，因為他們不使用名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "解釋亞耶爾文化：以族群而非個人名字自我認同"}

455. So I was instantly confused, thinking, is that his name?
→ {"text": "所以我立刻感到困惑，想著，這是他的名字嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. But that's actually a race.
→ {"text": "但那其實是一個族群。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. How does that work?
→ {"text": "這怎麼回事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 147

458. Did you hear about the Yahyel race before?
→ {"text": "你之前聽說過亞耶爾族群嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：亞耶爾"}


## Speaker Group 148

459. Yeah, I heard about that by then.
→ {"text": "是的，那時候我聽說過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 149

460. By Darryl or other channelers?
→ {"text": "是透過 Darryl 還是其他通靈者？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Darryl = Darryl Anka（巴夏通靈者），人名保留英文"}


## Speaker Group 150

461. Yeah, through Darryl.
→ {"text": "是的，透過 Darryl。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And so it confused me.
→ {"text": "所以這讓我困惑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. But also that the answer was so super crispy clear and loud, that confused me.
→ {"text": "而且這個答案如此超級清晰且響亮，這也讓我困惑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "強調收到訊息的清晰度"}

464. So I instantly like, whoa, backed away from it not knowing what to do with it, left it at that.
→ {"text": "所以我立刻就像，哇，退縮了，不知道該怎麼處理，就那樣放著了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "描述面對強烈靈性體驗的猶豫"}

465. And a month later, I went to see this woman.
→ {"text": "一個月後，我去找了那位女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "時間線回到主線故事"}

466. And she started channeling for me.
→ {"text": "她開始為我通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. And maybe two minutes into working on my back with her team--
→ {"text": "在她的團隊開始處理我的背部大約兩分鐘後——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 151

468. Was it a private session?
→ {"text": "是私人療程嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人插話確認"}


## Speaker Group 152

469. A private session, yes.
→ {"text": "私人療程，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. So I was laying on this massage table.
→ {"text": "所以我躺在按摩床上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. And she started to look at my back and what could be done maybe according to her guides.
→ {"text": "她開始檢查我的背部，看看根據她的指導靈，也許可以做些什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：指導靈"}

472. And then Arjun was just jumping up and down like, hey, hello, I've been trying to get to this girl for quite some time now.
→ {"text": "然後阿瓊就像跳上跳下地說，嘿，哈囉，我已經試著聯繫這個女孩好一段時間了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：阿瓊。生動描述阿瓊急切的樣子"}

473. And she said, oh, there's somebody here for you.
→ {"text": "她說，哦，這裡有人要找你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵時刻：阿瓊透過另一位通靈者出現"}

474. And then she just started speaking for him, you could say.
→ {"text": "然後她就開始為他說話，可以這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. Oh, I have to throw this little thing I forgot to tell you.
→ {"text": "哦，我必須補充一件我忘了告訴你的小事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "敘事技巧：插入貓的重要細節"}

476. Just before the session, she has a cat that is basically identical to the one that was put on my head.
→ {"text": "就在療程開始前，她有一隻貓，基本上和被放在我頭上的那隻一模一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵同步性時刻：一年前看到的貓影像變成現實"}

477. But I did not make that connection.
→ {"text": "但我當時沒有建立起這個連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "尚未意識到同步性"}


## Speaker Group 153

478. I was going to ask, what kind of cat?
→ {"text": "我正要問，是什麼品種的貓？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "主持人好奇貓的細節"}


## Speaker Group 154

479. It's a Nordic Forest cat.
→ {"text": "是挪威森林貓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：挪威森林貓"}

480. They're pretty big.
→ {"text": "牠們相當大隻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. They have long fur, a little bit longer snout, cute head, so pretty big.
→ {"text": "牠們有長毛，鼻子稍微長一點，可愛的頭，所以相當大隻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "描述貓的外觀細節"}

482. And it jumped on the table with me.

483. And it laid down next to my feet.

484. And it was just there rolled up and purring.
→ {"text": "牠就在那裡蜷縮著，發出呼嚕聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "溫馨的場景描述"}

485. And then she started channeling Arjun for me, who said, you know, you're ready from head to toe to do this kind of work yourself if you want to because we have this agreement.
→ {"text": "然後她開始為我通靈阿瓊，他說，你知道，你從頭到腳都準備好自己做這種工作了，如果你想的話，因為我們有這個協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：阿瓊、通靈。重大訊息：出生前協議的確認"}

→ {"text": "然後他開始解釋，他是亞耶爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：亞耶爾。確認族群身份"}

487. And I started to understand, oh, wow.
→ {"text": "我開始理解，哦，哇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "頓悟時刻"}

488. Or she got it through.
→ {"text": "或者說她傳達了這個訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. She translated it as she thought his name was Shayel because maybe she didn't know about the race, so this was funny.
→ {"text": "她翻譯成她以為他的名字是 Shayel，因為也許她不知道這個族群，所以這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Shayel 是對 Yahyel 的誤聽，保留英文"}

490. But at least, it gave me the synchronicity to understand that what happened a month earlier was actually not my imagination.
→ {"text": "但至少，這給了我同步性，讓我明白一個月前發生的事其實不是我的想像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：同步性。確認一個月前收到的 Yahyel 訊息是真實的"}

496. It took me about three days to get used to the entire idea.

→ {"text": "然後，作為當時的生命教練，我挑選了一些心態開放的客戶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "關鍵術語：生命教練。從生命教練轉型為通靈者"}

498. And I said, so are you up for an experiment? and I started to see what would come through and that was an enormous journey for me and it really sped up the entire process and now here I am...
→ {"text": "我說，那麼你願意嘗試一個實驗嗎？然後我開始看看會有什麼訊息傳來，那對我來說是一段巨大的旅程，它真的加速了整個過程，現在我就在這裡⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": "結尾：從實驗到正式成為通靈者的快速轉變"}
