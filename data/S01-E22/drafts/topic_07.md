## Speaker Group 172

567. It's like this is what I want to keep.

→ {"text": "我當時想，好吧，這是一部分——我想切換到另一條時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. So I started to rewrite it, and that was so powerful.
→ {"text": "所以我開始重寫，那真的非常有力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. And it's through this kind of playing around with the information that I got for myself that I eventually ended up discovering techniques like tapping and using that as a life coach.
→ {"text": "而且正是透過這樣玩弄我自己獲得的資訊，我最終發現了像敲打療法這樣的技術，並在生命教練工作中使用它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "tapping → 敲打療法"}

572. Because I had experienced in my own life how powerful these techniques are and how you can really use them.
→ {"text": "因為我在自己的生活中親身體驗到這些技術有多強大，以及你真的可以如何使用它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 175

573. And essentially, from my understanding now, because I've worked with tapping and plant medicine work, we're essentially going into these quantum states and rewriting the story, shifting timelines per se.
→ {"text": "而且本質上，根據我現在的理解，因為我做過敲打療法和植物靈藥的工作，我們本質上是在進入這些量子狀態，然後重寫故事，可以說是在轉換時間線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 176

574. On a cellular level, actually opening up-- there's these little portals, in a sense, in your body.

577. Well, there's a great video-- I post this all the time-- out there, this YouTube channel called Upriser, what's his name?
→ {"text": "嗯，有個很棒的影片——我一直在分享——就在那裡，有個叫 Upriser 的 YouTube 頻道，他叫什麼名字來著？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. I forgot the guy's name.
→ {"text": "我忘記那個人的名字了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. But he goes into explaining how DNA in itself is sort of a dimensional doorway for bringing through information from another dimension.
→ {"text": "但他深入解釋了 DNA 本身如何成為一種維度門戶，用來傳遞來自另一個維度的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "dimension → 維度"}

580. Gravity as well, but really the DNA strands and how they work in the molecules, with hydrogen within water-- you know, two hydrogens and one oxygen molecule-- creating portals to bring through information.
→ {"text": "重力也是，但真正的是 DNA 鏈以及它們在分子中如何運作，水中的氫——你知道的，兩個氫和一個氧分子——創造出通道來傳遞訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. Like gravity, it's all interconnected into science.

582. And we're now merging these worlds of art, philosophy, science.

583. And I think quantum physics is that mechanism we have now that really is like, yeah, this is how the universe works.
→ {"text": "我認為量子物理就是我們現在擁有的那個機制，真的就像是，對，這就是宇宙運作的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. And I think our space brothers and sisters are like, yeah, they're finally getting it.
→ {"text": "我覺得我們的宇宙兄弟姐妹們就像是，對，他們終於懂了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 178

585. Yes, they are.
