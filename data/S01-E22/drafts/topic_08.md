## Speaker Group 180

594. Oh, that's a funny question.
→ {"text": "噢，這是個有趣的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. I never really think into the future that much because I think that's really weird.
→ {"text": "我從來不太去想未來，因為我覺得那真的很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. I mean, I almost feel my brain cramp up trying to do that.

597. That never worked for me.

598. So I don't think ahead.

→ {"text": "——同步性與活在當下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "synchronicities按terminology.yaml譯為同步性"}


## Speaker Group 184

602. Let's see what happens, totally.
→ {"text": "看看會發生什麼，完全就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. Planning ahead really never worked for me.
→ {"text": "提前規劃對我來說真的從來行不通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. This is why as a child at school, I was already having issues with the way they see the future.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼小時候在學校，我就已經對他們看待未來的方式有問題了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. This is what you're going to do, and then logically, you would go to m-m-m.
→ {"text": "他們說這是你要做的事，然後按邏輯，你會去做某某某。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. So I'm still not planning anything, only like loosely.
→ {"text": "所以我仍然不規劃任何事，只是很鬆散地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. Like OK, I feel it's time to move maybe location, so I'll move to a more foresty location.

→ {"text": "我只需要在此時此地的時間線中發現它，它最終會在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "here and now按terminology.yaml譯為此時此地"}

613. So the channeling also is teaching me to surrender even more to the here and now.
→ {"text": "所以通靈也在教導我更加臣服於此時此地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "surrender按terminology.yaml譯為臣服"}

614. Because it's such a here and now state to be in, there's nothing else, everything else disappears for me.
→ {"text": "因為那是一種如此專注於此時此地的狀態，沒有其他東西了，其他一切都消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 188

619. I'm present, but I'm moving in and out of the amount of presence, I guess.
→ {"text": "我是在場的，但我會在存在感的程度之間進出，我想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. I can move it to the back a little more and kind of lose track of where things are going.
→ {"text": "我可以把注意力往後退一點，然後有點失去對事情走向的追蹤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. But I'll still get a hint, OK, now this dialogue is finished, we've gone to the next.
→ {"text": "但我仍然會得到一個提示，好的，現在這段對話結束了，我們進入下一段了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. And then I wake up again, pay attention to new storyline.
→ {"text": "然後我又醒過來，注意新的故事線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. And I have to be more present when I'm doing it in English, as it's my second language.

627. But it's in and out.
→ {"text": "但仍然是進進出出的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. And if they increase the tempo, I'm more on one word at a time, translating one word at a time, instead of-- I've had moments where I don't know where the sentence is going at all, just focusing on the correct pronunciation of every word.
→ {"text": "如果他們加快速度，我會更專注在一次一個字，一次翻譯一個字，而不是——我曾經有過一些時刻，我完全不知道句子會走向哪裡，只是專注在每個字的正確發音上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

629. But I'm still conscious.
→ {"text": "但我仍然是有意識的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 191

630. And then do you surprise yourself when you go in those one word at a time moments, and then afterwards, you're like, oh, I actually made a full sentence?
→ {"text": "然後當你進入那種一次一個字的時刻，之後你會驚訝地發現，噢，我居然組成了一個完整的句子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. Yes, I have these moments.
→ {"text": "是的，我有這些時刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. Sometimes the sentences are-- you know, if you would read them, they have 12 commas in them.
→ {"text": "有時候那些句子——你知道的，如果你讀它們，裡面有12個逗號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. Like, whoa, where is this ever going to end?
→ {"text": "就像，哇，這到底什麼時候才會結束？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. And then it still makes sense.
→ {"text": "然後它還是有意義的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. I love that.
→ {"text": "我喜歡這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 195

640. Yeah, since starting the series, and investigating channeling and going into it, and having my own channeling experiences, I have the same thing.
→ {"text": "是的，自從開始這個系列，調查通靈並深入其中，擁有自己的通靈經驗後，我也有同樣的感受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

641. I've channeled information, and in my mind, I'm like, this is not going to make any sense at all.
→ {"text": "我通靈傳遞資訊時，在我心智裡，我會想，這根本不會有任何意義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "mind按terminology.yaml譯為心智"}


## Speaker Group 196

642. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 197

643. It's gibberish, what is this-- in the moment that you're doing it, because it's more of a feeling.
→ {"text": "這是胡言亂語，這是什麼——在你做的當下，因為那更像是一種感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. You're just like, OK, I get it, but the rest of the world, they can't get this.
→ {"text": "你就想，好吧，我懂了，但世界上其他人，他們無法理解這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. And then you go back and you review it, and you're like, holy smokes, it's actually using semi-correct grammar even.
→ {"text": "然後你回頭檢視它，你就想，天啊，它居然甚至使用了半正確的文法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. And you're like, wow, that's incredible.
→ {"text": "然後你就想，哇，那真是不可思議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 198

647. Recognizable.
→ {"text": "可以辨識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "所以對於所有在看的觀眾，這個通靈的東西，它是有內容的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "是啊，有趣的是，有時候我和不熟悉通靈是什麼的人交談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. And they think it's just a big act.

651. And I'm like, no, you can't.
→ {"text": "然後我就想，不，你做不到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. I mean, there are actors who channel.

653. You know, I think actors do channel.
→ {"text": "你知道，我認為演員確實會通靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 200

654. It's a form of channeling.
→ {"text": "那是一種通靈形式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 201

655. When you get into that state, it just comes naturally.
→ {"text": "當你進入那個狀態時，它就自然而然地流出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. And the better ones, the better actors do get into that channeling state.
→ {"text": "而更優秀的演員，那些更好的演員確實會進入那種通靈狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. But to make it up-- and I guess we are making it up as we go along.
→ {"text": "但要編造它——我想我們確實是一邊走一邊編造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. But it's the ultimate improv-- right?

## Speaker Group 202

660. --where you're just completely surrender and just whatever comes out.

→ {"text": "但流出來的資訊不是事先寫好的劇本，也不是預先學習的對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. It just comes out, and it's quite phenomenal.
→ {"text": "它就這樣流出來，而且相當驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 204

663. And that's why, I think, I felt so pulled towards meditation and emptying the mind out.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼，我想，我如此被冥想和清空心智所吸引。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "meditation按terminology.yaml譯為冥想，mind譯為心智"}

664. I fell in love with that very young, so I started practicing that and then the chanting, was a Buddhist for a while.
→ {"text": "我很年輕的時候就愛上了那個，所以我開始練習，然後是誦唱，我當了一陣子佛教徒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "chanting按terminology.yaml譯為誦唱，Buddhist譯為佛教徒"}

→ {"text": "然後在某個時刻，阿瓊就站出來讓我知道，好的，你準備好了，如果你願意的話，我們開始吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Arjun按terminology.yaml譯為阿瓊"}

666. It's full surrender.
→ {"text": "這是完全的臣服。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 205

667. I'm so glad you have chosen this path to do this and share the information and bring forth these beings that we can hopefully soon, sooner than later, meet face to face, in a physical interaction.
→ {"text": "我真的很高興你選擇了這條道路來做這件事，分享這些資訊，帶來這些存有，希望我們能很快地，越早越好，以物質的形式面對面地與他們相遇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "physical按terminology.yaml譯為物質的"}
