→ {"text": "伴隨療癒的動作放大了在星光層面上正在進行的工作，因為他們使用我的能量身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "astral → 星光（依照 terminology.yaml）"}

303. So in a sense, they wouldn't necessarily need my body.
→ {"text": "所以在某種意義上，他們不一定需要我的身體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. But because we are physical, I'm like the portal, in a sense, physicalizing the movements here, getting even closer to the other person.
