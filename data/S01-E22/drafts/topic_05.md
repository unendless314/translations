## Speaker Group 114

337. And the work you do with the energy healing-- and you did a session for me yesterday-- that work, using your cosmic clan to communicate with my cosmic clan and then help reflect that.
→ {"text": "你做的能量療癒工作——你昨天幫我做了一次——那種工作，是運用你的宇宙家族與我的宇宙家族溝通，然後幫助反映出那些訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. That's sort of how--
→ {"text": "那就是某種程度上——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 115

339. Yeah.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. It's all coming together and coming out as one storyline, the information that's coming through.
→ {"text": "所有資訊匯聚在一起，以一條連貫的敘事線呈現出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 116

341. And it's not necessarily your cosmic clan saying this per se.
→ {"text": "而且，這並不一定是你的宇宙家族本身在說這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. It's just that they are maybe better communicators to my cosmic clan.
→ {"text": "只是他們可能是更好的溝通者，能與我的宇宙家族對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. And they can say, OK, his cosmic clan is saying this, so do this.
→ {"text": "他們可以說，好，他的宇宙家族在說這個，所以這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 117

344. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. So it's not that they're-- we have this idea of how psychics work.
→ {"text": "所以這不是說他們——我們對通靈者的工作方式有一種固定想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. And they can read our minds and go into this stuff and do other stuff.
→ {"text": "覺得他們可以讀取我們的心思，進入這些東西，做各種事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. But in reality, what's probably really happening is just my cosmic guides are communicating with your cosmic guides.
→ {"text": "但實際上，真正發生的可能只是我的宇宙指導靈在與你的宇宙指導靈溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. And then you just have a clearer channel to your cosmic team than I do.
→ {"text": "而你只是比我擁有一條更清晰的通靈管道，能連接到你的宇宙團隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 118

349. Ah, I don't know.
→ {"text": "呃，我不確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 119

350. I mean, I would say you do because you're able to have those dialogues in the work you're doing.
→ {"text": "我是說，我會說你確實如此，因為你能在工作中進行那些對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 120

351. I think everybody can.
→ {"text": "我覺得每個人都可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 121

352. I think everybody can too.
→ {"text": "我也覺得每個人都可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 122

353. But of course, I will say it's both.
→ {"text": "但當然，我會說兩者都是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. Because some people need a little bit more training back, which is really what I would want to call it-- training back into that actually natural state.
→ {"text": "因為有些人需要多一點「再訓練」，這才是我想稱呼它的方式——再訓練回到那個實際上自然的狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Because that's our nature to have that very open.
→ {"text": "因為那種非常開放的狀態，就是我們的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 123

356. And the whole idea of shamanism and shamanic practices with our native cultures, that's sort of what they, from my understanding training with them-- when someone would go to visit the shaman, in essence, they're doing the same thing.
→ {"text": "而薩滿以及原住民文化中的薩滿實踐的整個概念，就是這樣——根據我與他們一起訓練的理解——當有人去拜訪薩滿時，本質上他們在做同樣的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. [WIND CHIMES RING] The shaman is connecting to the other person's guides.
→ {"text": "【風鈴聲】薩滿在連接那個人的指導靈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And the guides are telling them to do this work.
→ {"text": "而指導靈在告訴他們做這項工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 124

359. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 125

360. As opposed to, I'm doing this work because I'm psychic and I know better.
→ {"text": "而不是說，我做這項工作是因為我有通靈能力，我更懂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. It's not that at all.
→ {"text": "完全不是那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 126

362. I even don't like that.
→ {"text": "我甚至不喜歡那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. I avoid even the word "healer" on my website, for instance, because I'm just a facilitator.
→ {"text": "我甚至在我的網站上避免使用「療癒師」這個詞，因為我只是個促進者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "核心概念:facilitator vs healer的區別"}

364. I'm letting stuff through.
→ {"text": "我只是讓訊息流通而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. I never know what's going to happen.
→ {"text": "我從來不知道會發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. I don't have a preset idea about what somebody would need because I don't know that.
→ {"text": "我對某個人需要什麼沒有預設的想法，因為我並不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. That other person actually knows best.
→ {"text": "那個人自己才真正最清楚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. So all that is being asked for in that moment and being allowed in is a reflection of their own inner wisdom.
→ {"text": "所以在那個當下被請求進來、被允許進入的一切，都是他們自己內在智慧的反映。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 127

369. And I think as we define and understand these terms better, we can tell this story now in this way.
→ {"text": "而我認為，隨著我們更好地定義和理解這些術語，我們現在可以用這種方式來講述這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. I think maybe before, we didn't have the understanding, or the knowledge to go that deep into it.
→ {"text": "我覺得也許以前，我們沒有那樣的理解，或者沒有知識能深入到那個程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. So we just said, yeah, I'm a healer, and I'm healing you.
→ {"text": "所以我們就說，對，我是療癒師，我在療癒你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. And then we go, yeah, you're healing me.
→ {"text": "然後我們說，對，你在療癒我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. But in reality, nobody's healing anybody else.
→ {"text": "但實際上，沒有人在療癒別人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 128

374. It's all self-healing eventually.
→ {"text": "最終，一切都是自我療癒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "核心哲學:自我療癒"}


## Speaker Group 129

375. Eventually, it's self-healing.
→ {"text": "最終，都是自我療癒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. And so I'm just giving-- it's the permission slip thing-- I'm giving you permission to... it's tricking myself in essence.
→ {"text": "所以我只是在給——這就是許可證的概念——我在給你許可去……本質上是在欺騙我自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "permission slip是Bashar通訊的核心概念"}

377. I'm like, I'm doing the healing work.
→ {"text": "我就像在說，我在做療癒工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. But just because of the way my mind works and the construct of my reality....
→ {"text": "但只是因為我的心智運作方式，以及我的實相架構……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. I need this physicalized, outside thing to do the healing.
→ {"text": "我需要這個物質化的、外在的東西來進行療癒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 130

380. But that still takes away a little bit of the idea of-- you used the word "need" in this description.
→ {"text": "但那還是稍微削弱了一點——你在這個描述中用了「需要」這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 131

381. Yeah, but I guess I'm not saying that I need that.
→ {"text": "對，但我想我不是說我需要那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. I'm just saying that that's the way of a lot of our old ways of looking at things.
→ {"text": "我只是說，那是我們很多舊有看待事物的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. And many people too-- you know, going to the doctor, getting the surgery, taking the pill, all of this is really an illusion.
→ {"text": "而很多人也是——你知道的，去看醫生、接受手術、吃藥，所有這些真的都是一種幻覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 132

384. Yeah, it's a belief system, all of it.
→ {"text": "對，這全都是信念系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 133

385. It's a belief system.
→ {"text": "這是一個信念系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. All of it is just there for, you know, pharmaceutical companies to make lots of money.
→ {"text": "這一切只是為了讓——你知道的——製藥公司賺大錢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. And this is why they are so keen on supporting the illusion.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼他們如此熱衷於支持這個幻覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 134

388. Yeah, but you cannot do it alone.
→ {"text": "對，但你不能獨自完成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 135

389. You can't do it alone, no.
→ {"text": "你無法獨自完成，不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. This is disempowering, is sort of the name of the game for those structures that are in place in order for us to be reliant on them.
→ {"text": "這是在削弱力量，這就是那些既有結構的運作方式，目的就是讓我們依賴它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. And that's what they feed off of.
→ {"text": "而那就是它們賴以為生的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. It's sort of vampire-type energy that can grow because that's the archetype of that energy.
→ {"text": "那是一種吸血鬼式的能量，能夠成長，因為那就是那種能量的原型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 136

393. And then there's the trap, a little bit, to think that that is just being pursued in the center, continued even in nowadays healing work, even if you're a very new paradigm about it.
→ {"text": "然後有一個小陷阱，就是認為那種做法只是在中心被追求，甚至在現今的療癒工作中持續著，即使你採用的是非常新的範式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. I've heard this, so I want to throw this in.
→ {"text": "我聽到過這個觀點，所以我想把它加進來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. And Arjun-- because I have my own doubts about this, before I started doing private sessions, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a part of that idea that somebody would come to me for help.
→ {"text": "而阿瓊——因為我自己對此有疑慮，在我開始做個案之前，我不確定自己是否想要成為那種概念的一部分，就是有人會來找我尋求幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. And so I asked him, so how do you look at this?
→ {"text": "所以我問他，你怎麼看待這件事?", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. And he's like, well, you've all decided to be with a lot of people here, a lot of reflections of yourself.
→ {"text": "他就說，嗯，你們都決定在這裡與很多人在一起，很多你自己的映照。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. So it's also playful, and joyful, and beautiful to look in each other's mirror.
→ {"text": "所以，互相照鏡子也是嬉戲的、喜悅的、美好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. It's what happens when you fall in love.
→ {"text": "這就是你墜入愛河時發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. It's when you pick your friends.
→ {"text": "這就是你選擇朋友時發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. It's even when you pick your family, even though that doesn't always look like such a pretty mirror.
→ {"text": "甚至是你選擇家人時，儘管那並不總是看起來像一面如此美好的鏡子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. But all of that is part of a dance that you chose to be a part of.
→ {"text": "但所有這些都是你選擇參與的舞蹈的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. So that helped me also understand and embrace even the old paradigm medical system a little more, to be like, OK, it is what it is.
→ {"text": "所以那也幫助我更加理解並接納舊範式的醫療系統，去說，好吧，它就是它本來的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. And whatever direction you navigate to most, just choose that.
→ {"text": "而無論你最常導航到哪個方向，就選擇那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. And I also go for regular reflections, I would say, with colleague interstellar healers that are channelers, who facilitate realignments to get some more insights on my own blind spots.
→ {"text": "而我也會定期去尋求映照，我會說，與同行的星際療癒師們——他們是通靈者——他們促進重新校準，讓我對自己的盲點獲得更多洞見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. Because there are always things that you're learning about and expanding.
→ {"text": "因為總是有你正在學習和擴展的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 137

407. It's always good to have another perspective.
→ {"text": "總是很好能有另一個視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 138

408. Totally, yes.
→ {"text": "完全是，對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 139

409. So go get a second opinion.
→ {"text": "所以去獲得第二意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 140

410. Yes, exactly.
→ {"text": "對，正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. I love more angles to a topic.
→ {"text": "我喜歡一個主題有更多角度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. The more the better.
→ {"text": "愈多愈好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. And then I will pick the one that resonates most with me.
→ {"text": "然後我會選擇與我最共鳴的那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 141

414. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. No one is better than the other--
→ {"text": "沒有哪一個比另一個更好——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 142

416. No, it's all good.
→ {"text": "沒有，全都好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 143

417. --for the collective.
→ {"text": "——對集體而言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. But for the individual, you may have better resonance.
→ {"text": "但對個體而言，你可能會有更好的共鳴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
