## Speaker Group 1

1. You are all naturally wired for growth and spiritual expansion.
→ {"text": "你們所有人天生都具備成長和靈性擴展的本能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. The expansion is accelerated by the ongoing invitation from the level of the higher self to look beyond that which is already known by the person and mind.
→ {"text": "這種擴展會因為高我層面的持續邀請而加速，邀請你超越個人與心智已知的範圍去探索。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. And so, you will from time to time surprise yourselves by manifesting certain circumstances that tickle the current understanding of the self, and nudge it into a broader, wider perspective.
→ {"text": "因此，你們會不時地讓自己感到驚訝，顯化出某些情境，這些情境會挑動你對自我的當前理解，並推動它進入更廣闊、更寬廣的視角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. The more you sense yourself, feeling either triggered or intrigued by the information delivered to you, the more you are signally to yourself the relevancy of it, as a usable stepping stone in your personal storyline.
→ {"text": "當你感受到自己被傳遞給你的資訊所觸動或吸引時，你越是在向自己發出信號，表明這資訊與你相關，可以作為你個人故事線中可用的墊腳石。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 'signally' 應為 'signaling'，已修正翻譯"}

5. Where this relevancy lies is in the finding of your own personal truth regarding the information given to you, or whether it lies in the facing of certain fear- based beliefs so you will be able to transform them.
→ {"text": "這種相關性可能在於，你找到關於所接收資訊的個人真理，或者在於面對某些恐懼導向的信念，以便你能夠轉化它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. You all play this game, both on an individual as well as collective scale.
→ {"text": "你們所有人都在玩這場遊戲，無論是在個人層面還是集體層面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. Now when it comes to open contact with the ETs, with multi-dimensionals, with those aspects of you that you have chosen to temporarily forget, to serve you on your journey of remembering on the Earth stage.
→ {"text": "現在談到與外星存有、多維存有的公開接觸，也就是與那些你選擇暫時遺忘的自我面向接觸，這是為了在地球舞台上服務於你的憶起之旅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. We understand that for many, and for a long time, there may seem to have been hardly anything more 'out there' than this particular idea, and yet you have shown yourselves in over a thousand ways along this journey, that deep within, you all know and never truly have forgotten your connection to the stars or to your greater selves.
→ {"text": "我們理解，對許多人來說，長久以來，似乎沒有什麼比這個想法更「離奇」的了。然而，在這趟旅程中，你們以超過千種方式向自己證明了，在內心深處，你們都知曉、也從未真正遺忘與星辰的連結，或與更偉大自我的連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. This type of contact, it is within you already.
→ {"text": "這種接觸，早已存在於你們內在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. It has been depicted in cave paintings and ancient artifacts.
→ {"text": "它已被描繪在洞穴壁畫與古代文物中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. It has been reflected back to you by those ancient and modern channelers you know usually refer to as artists, by their paintings, music, books and films, lyrics from songs and poetry throughout the ages.
→ {"text": "它已透過那些古今通靈者——你們通常稱之為藝術家——的作品反射回來，透過他們的繪畫、音樂、書籍和電影，透過歷代的歌詞與詩篇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. And this type of contact, though not always shared with the public, already has shown up in many astronomical and army based observations and even is represented within your own DNA and let us tell you there is no 'junk' in there.
→ {"text": "這種接觸，雖然並不總是公開分享，但已經在許多天文與軍方的觀測中顯現，甚至體現在你們自己的 DNA 中。讓我們告訴你，DNA 裡沒有所謂的「垃圾」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. It is all pure and infinite potential, and once embraced it will come to feel like a logical part of a much greater puzzle, that, once you speak it's language, the language of your hearts, you will continue to explore within your own evolution as we are too exploring the infinite amount of wondrous ways wherein All That Is expresses itself by meeting and greeting you.
→ {"text": "一切都是純淨而無限的潛能，一旦你擁抱它，它就會感覺像是一個更宏大拼圖的合理部分。一旦你說出它的語言——你的心之語言——你就會在自身進化中繼續探索，正如我們也在探索「一切萬有」透過與你相遇、問候你的無限美妙方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 \"it's\" 應為 \"its\"，已修正翻譯"}

14. Ever wonder if there's intelligent life elsewhere in the universe?
→ {"text": "你是否曾經想過，宇宙中其他地方是否存在智慧生命？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

17. And on March 29th 2007 in the middle of the day, I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.
→ {"text": "在 2007 年 3 月 29 日，大白天的時候，我在天空中看到了一些奇怪的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. Coincidentally, I was working on the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.
→ {"text": "巧合的是，當時我正在參與電影《阿凡達》的拍攝，扮演一個外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. And ever since then I've been on a quest...
→ {"text": "從那時起，我就踏上了一段探索之旅……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. To find out if aliens really do exist and if so... ...are they here with us?
→ {"text": "我想找出外星人是否真的存在，如果存在的話……他們是否就在我們身邊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. If beings of higher intelligence are here... ...what is their purpose?
→ {"text": "如果更高智慧的存有在這裡……他們的目的是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. Why don't they make themselves more known?
→ {"text": "為什麼他們不讓自己更廣為人知？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. Why the secrecy?

24. I've asked these questions to many experts, yet each seems to have a different theory.
→ {"text": "我向許多專家提出過這些問題，但每個人似乎都有不同的理論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. So I thought to myself, why not ask the aliens directly?

→ {"text": "嗯，算是吧……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
